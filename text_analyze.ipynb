But overall fertilizer traffic dipped by just 1.6pc across all the carriers to 6.9mn short tons (6.3mn metric tonnes) on the strength of a one-third\\nincrease in traffic on the US operations of Canadian National (CN). CN moved 307,552st of fertilizer inputs in the quarter.\\nRates for input chemicals declined at every carrier except CSX, where the cost to move fertilizer inputs gained 3.6pc to $9.03/st.\\nThe volume of super-phosphate solutions on most of the US operations of the Class I railroads and but overall sector\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nQuarterly Freight review: Rates\\ntraffic rose by 1.1pc to 5.7mn st because of a 48pc reduc- tion in Kansas City Southern traffic. The small Class I moved 10,191st of coal in the quarter compared with 19,739 in first quarter 2014. The stronger volume environment at most of the carriers supported higher rates for super-phosphate solu- tions at a majority of the carriers. Overall rates added 2.4pc to $31.61/st across all the railroads.\\nThe western railroads took stronger price increases on their\\ntraffic than the average with BNSF rates up by 7.2pc to\\n$44.25/st in first quarter 2015 while Union Pacific (UP) pric- ing gained 3.9pc. Shippers of fertilizer chemicals and super- phosphates ended first quarter 2015 at $48.82/st.\\nRates in the east were mixed, but lower on an absolute level than their western counterparts, at least in part because of shorter lengths of haul.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nFundamentals\\nAgriculture\\nWeather: Tropical Storm Bill pushed through the Texas coast this week, though the state did not sustain flood dam-\\nage similar to that induced by heavy storms at the end of May. Storms in the Midwest were much more pronounced, stretching from the Mississippi Delta to the upper Northeast. While precipitation dissipated over most of the country by mid-week, rainfall hung over east Texas and Missouri, whose crop progress is already well behind the five-year average. The 6-10 day forecast shows unusually dry weather through- out the south and Mississippi Delta, though most of the Corn Belt and Northeast should see rainfall, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Temperatures will also likely rise to above-average marks in the lower Atlantic and southern Corn Belt. The western Corn Belt and plains are expected to stay dry and show average temperatures in the next 6-10 days.\\nCrop progress: Plantings and crop conditions were mostly\\n6-10 day precipitation outlook\\nin line with previous weekly reports and five-year averages, though soybean plantings still trail their average rates, especially in Missouri and Kansas, which have seen an unusu- ally large amount of rain. US soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year aver- age for the second straight week, likely slowed by inclem- ent weather since the end of May. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average. Winter wheat conditions were rated 22pc poor and very poor, while good and excellent ratings were 43pc of the total crop. Spring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent.\\n— USDA\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nCrop prices: Storms in the US Gulf coast and Midwest proved bullish from front-month crop prices this week, especially for soybeans. With soybean plantings lagging and weather threatening late-season plantings, front-month soybean futures prices ended the week at $9.78/bushel, the highest close for the contract since 5 May. November soybean prices also climbed, ending the week at $9.42/bushel, the highest mark since 8 May and up nearly 40¢/bushel from early-week settlements.\\nAmmonia margin vs natural gas\\nHenry Hub (left scale) $/mnBtu\\nAmmonia producer margin (right scale) $/st\\nFront-month corn prices also climbed on weather concerns. July corn prices ended the week at $3.58/bushel, a 10¢/ bushel rally from earlier in the week. December corn prices held steady week-on-week, fall 2¢/bushel to settle 18 June at 3.73/bushel.\\nFeedstock\\nUS natural gas futures ended lower this week on a govern- ment report of a larger-than-average build in gas stockpiles and forecasts for milder weather in the coming weeks.\\nNymex gas for July delivery fell by 7.8¢/mmBtu, or 2.7pc, to settle at $2.777/mmBtu. Prompt-month prices rose to a four-week settlement high earlier this week but surrendered some of those gains ahead of the US Energy Information Administration\\'s (EIA) weekly inventory report.\\nUS gas stockpiles rose in the week ended 12 June by 89 Bcf (2.5bn m³), the EIA said. The build was smaller than the previous three injections, all of which exceeded 100 Bcf, be- cause of hotter weather. Last week\\'s injection fell short of analyst estimates for an increase of 92 Bcf, but it surpassed the five-year average injection for the week of 87 Bcf.\\nInventories have increased rapidly this year on increased domestic output. Stockpiles last week rose to 2.433 Tcf — 43pc higher than a year earlier and 1.9pc above the five-year average.\\nThe US rig count reached a 12-year low as weak oil prices forced producers to pull back drilling, but the shale indus- try\\'s run is far from over, oil major BP said.\\nThe rig count fell by nine to 859 this week, according to data from oilfield services company Baker Hughes. That\\'s the low-\\nest since 17 January 2003 when it fell to 845. It surpassed the lowest level of the previous market crash of 2008-09, when it dropped to 876 on 12 June 2009.\\nThe US shale boom allowed the US to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world\\'s largest oil producer and Russia as the larg- est producer of oil and gas, BP said in its annual Statistical Review said. US output increased by 1.6mn b/d last year, making the country the first ever to boost output by at least 1mn b/d a year for three consecutive years.\\nFreight\\nFertilizer barge movements on most US rivers have slowed as a surge in high water has made navigation difficult and forced the closure of several locks and dams.\\nRecent rains in some northern tier states, including Michi- gan, Minnesota and North Dakota, helped create runoff to the rivers that drove up water levels on the Illinois and up- per Mississippi rivers.\\nTwo Illinois river locks have been shut, preventing barges from moving north or south through the Starved Rock lock in Utica and the Marseilles lock in Marseilles. Barges continue to pass through high water at the Peoria lock in Creve Coeur and the LaGrange lock in Versailles because those locations have wicket dams that have been lowered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Dams at other locks are more perma- nent, requiring those sites to close in the high water.\\nBarge rates were unchanged this week after rising recently because of the high water and efforts by operators to limit storage. Some barge operators are offering higher spot rates for July because they are trying to hold onto more equip-\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nNorthbound rates originating from miles 90-184 for dry, bulk fertilizers. * No freight rates available based on seasonal closures.\\nment instead of allowing customers to use barges for storage until fall. Many are wary of releasing too much equipment this summer because they want to be sure to meet contract customer needs, a concern generated by last fall’s tight market.\\nSt Louis barge rates held for a second week at $9-10.75/short ton. Barges continue to pass through the area but that may change if high water in the area persists.\\nIf there is more rain in the next few days, operators may hold back northbound barges heading to the upper Mississip- pi and Illinois rivers for safety reasons. The Mississippi gauge at St Louis this morning was 33.2ft, above flood level of 30ft, and is expected to peak at 37.1ft by 22 June.\\nA tropical depression is heading for the for the middle Mis- sissippi and Ohio river valleys after making landfall along the central Texas coast on 16 June as a tropical storm before weakening.\\nArkansas river barge traffic has again been slowed by high water, less than 10 days after the corps reopened all locks from a similar problem. The Mayo lock near Fort Smith, Arkansas, has been shut, blocking fertilizer barges heading\\nnorth towards Muskogee and Inola/Catoosa.\\nBarge rates to destinations between Pine Bluff and Little Rock were flat at $14.50-16.50/st after increasing last week. Traffic along the waterway remains restricted to six-barge tows that can only be operated in daylight.\\nNitrogen\\nSustained rice demand and short-covering sustained higher loaded/prompt urea prices this week, but July values were under pressure amid concerns of higher imports and im- pending domestic production increases. Meanwhile, UAN and other nitrogen products have seen a steadier decline to summer reset values.\\nUrea (g)\\nThe urea barge market again traded in a wide range as traders placed a premium on loaded product, particularly as some scrambled to cover first-half June contract commit- ments.\\nThat premium led to multiple loaded barge trades at $380/ st fob Nola, up by $10/st from the high end of last week’s assessment and marking the highest point since 17 July 2014. Prompt/June-loading barges trended in line with the prior week, trading from $346-355/st fob Nola, with prices held up by rice demand in the south and the last tail of corn top- dress demand.\\nJuly prices were harder to pin down because of scarce bids. First-half July, CF-specific barges traded at $320/st fob Nola and July non-Chinese traded at $314/st fob. But offers for first-half July dropped from the low/mid-$310s/st fob Nola mid-week to $305/st as of press time, setting the bottom end of this week’s assessment. In addition, an August-loading non-Chinese barge traded at $292/st fob Nola, nearly a $100/ st below loaded prices this week.\\nThe lack of July buying interest came as traders assess a growing import lineup—a function of the $100/st price rally since April—most of which is likely to arrive after late-season demand has concluded. At least 260,000t of granular urea is estimated to arrive in July, with Saudi Arabia’s Sabic now planning to bring 60,000t to Nola in late July—its first of 10 cargoes for the US for the 2015-16 fertilizer year.\\nThe US typically imports less urea in July because of an ebb in seasonal demand. However, it did import 250,000t during\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPrices\\nJuly 2014 by vessel, compared to just 81,000t in 2013. In ad- dition to the estimated 260,000t for this July, a few vessels remain up in the air, with additional shipments from Algeria and Kuwait possible.\\nContinued barge delays on the Arkansas river kept ware- house prices firm in Inola/Catoosa and St Louis. Inola/ Catoosa urea inventory is nearing depletion with those with remaining tons consistently achieving $415/st fot. Only a few thousand tons are estimated still in Inola/Catoosa and barge resupply is still a ways off because of high-water restricting traffic on the Arkansas river (see Freight). The shortage in Inola/Catoosa has pulled prices up in St Louis, which climbed as high as $390/st fot as buyers look to truck urea from that hub to southern destinations. Northeastern Arkansas warehouses on the Mississippi river have also achieved $410/ st fot.\\nPrices in Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities were un- changed amid limited activity.\\nIn projects, CF Industries will add 130,000 st/yr of granular urea/DEF/urea liquor capacity to its Courtright, Ontario,\\nEstimated incoming urea vessels\\nplant through a debottlenecking project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

STC is ex- pected to target 600,000-1mn t. Chinese offers firmed as a result, with granular rising to $315/t fob and prills at $310-315/t fob. Chinese producers are taking a firm stance because of strong expected demand in India and a longer than usual tail to domestic demand.\\n\\x84\\x84In Algeria, Nitron is loading 20,000t of granular urea this month, with 14,000t bound for the US and the balance headed to France.

Seller price indications have increased to at or near $240/t cfr, particularly as a summer turnaround of a Russian producer’s facility has removed some cargoes from the typical US lineup. However, potential buyers are resist- ing prices above the $235/t cfr mark.\\nAlthough movement to the field has been limited, terminal prices have yet to move toward summer fill values—likely because the remaining inventory was purchased at higher, in-season values. Latest offers are heard in the range of $280-295/st fob Nola for UAN32.\\nAmmonium nitrate (p)\\nDemand remains lackluster for ammonium nitrate. Barge\\nlength on the river continues to pressure buy price ideas, but no new business was confirmed this week.

Producers are focused on building fall inventory with spring demand concluded.\\nHouston/Pasadena prices are unchanged at $260/st fot as producers look to complete seasonal commitments before considering a summer fill price. Given the nationwide tight- ness of amsul, some are not ruling out the possibility of flat summer pricing. In the Northern Plains, fill prices have been discussed around $300-310/st delivered, depending on loca- tion.\\nAmsul production on the Texas Gulf Coast was minimally impacted by Tropical Storm Bill, which made landfall on 16 June southwest of Houston. Producers reported normal load- ing operations during the storm.\\nAmmonia\\nPrices in the US ammonia market continued to soften this week with the end of side dress season hastened by a sud- den and severe bout of wet weather hitting the east Corn Belt. Corn is now expected to be too tall for further ap- plications by the time saturated soils have dried out. This has caused an earlier than expected cutoff for offtake this season, and could result in increased carryout for suppliers in the region.\\nEast Corn Belt prices moved to $590-610/st fot, a $10/st decline from last week’s range. There was little if any buying at these levels, but offers have drifted only marginally lower given the tight inventory situation.\\nIn the west Corn Belt there has been little or no business concluded and prices are still discussed in the wide range of $525-590/st fot, with the high end farther east.\\nDistributors have yet to move to summer fill values as there is little sense of urgency to sell with inventories lean despite\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n* Indicates confirmation with Zepol import/export database.\\nValues without * are estimates based on vessel size and/or previous shipments.\\n— Genscape\\nthe weather-shortened season. Instead, the near-term focus will be on rebuilding stocks ahead of fall demand, with some light fill selling likely later in the summer.\\nHowever, most producers have moved to summer fill pric-\\ning. In Oklahoma, offers have moved to the $470-480/st fob range. Meanwhile, there are reports a Texas producer is selling summer-loading tons at $450/st fot.

DAP prices appear to have hit a floor, with the US market at a significant discount to other markets limiting downside. However, price upside could be limited by low crop prices that may result in a de- cline in fall grower demand. The paper market underscores this flat trend with prices for August/September virtually even with prompt values.\\nThe US import lineup for the third quarter for now consists of one expected DAP/MAP vessel from Morocco’s OCP—likely a contractual shipment for PotashCorp. Additional spot car- goes from Morocco have been treated with skepticism given Nola’s low prices, especially relative to Brazil.\\nIn exports, Mosaic sold 17,000t DAP to various Latin Ameri- can markets for July shipment at $470-474/t fob Tampa, down slightly from last business.\\nHigher shipments to India and Latin American countries boosted US exports of DAP/MAP in May to their highest monthly total since May 2014.\\nThe US exported 236,180st P2O5 of DAP/MAP (estimated 450,000-510,000st product) in May, a 33.8pc month-on- month climb but down 4.8pc from the same month last year,\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nUS phosphate import tracker\\nPhosphate barge business\\naccording to the Fertilizer Institute (TFI).\\nThe US shipped 75,945st P2O5 to India in May, the highest monthly total since October 2014 and the second consecu- tive month it has sent exports to the major DAP consumer since October-November 2014. These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.\\nThe US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.\\nThe US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.\\nCanada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same month last year. The US exported 11,736st P2O5 to Mexico in May, down 18.5pc from April and 31.8pc from May 2014.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nHigher May exports led January-May US P2O5 exports to reach 869,339st, a 3.4pc year-over-year increase.\\nUS phosphoric acid exports jumped in May after lagging in previous months, reaching 35,396st P2O5, a 27.5pc jumped from the same month last year. India received 52.4pc of all US shipments, with Brazil, Mexico and Canada rounding out the remaining supply. Phosphoric acid exports for the calen- dar year-to-date are down 18.5pc to 111,233st P2O5.\\nDAP/MAP\\nDAP barge prices were steady this week with trades for July-loading domestic tons at $419/st fob Nola. Bid/offers for physical barges bracketed either side of that level, upholding the prior $418-420/st fob Nola range. A domestic DAP barge traded this week at $425/st fob Nola, but was excluded from the range because of specific circumstances that made it not representative of the market, according to the seller. No MAP trades were confirmed, but the product continues to be indicated at a $5-10/st premium to DAP.\\nDAP/MAP warehouse demand is seasonally limited and prices unchanged from last week. Some wholesalers still have post- ed DAP prices of $460-465/st fot, particularly on the Ohio river, but no substantial sales at that level were confirmed.\\nInternational phosphate highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, phosphate-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a decline in demand in sugar cane and second- crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy planting season which begins in September, according to industry association Anda. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period. Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009,\\n0\\naccording to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increas- ing. This sluggishness has contributed to a bearish tone in prices, with MAP offers dipping as low as $490s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84In Argentina, a trader sold 30,000t Australian DAP at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment, while China’s YUC sold June MAP at $500-505/t cfr to this market.\\n\\x84\\x84China produced 4.3mn t of DAP and 2.9mn t of MAP in the first quarter, which are year-over-year increases of 17pc and 13pc, respectively, according to the China Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry. China exported 935,000t DAP and 481,000t MAP in the first quarter, according to customs data--both substantially higher year-over-year because of the country\\'s move to a flat year-round export tax.\\nPotash\\nThe North American market remains in a seasonal lull ahead of formal summer fill price announcements.\\nNon-Belarusian import barges for June/July-loading traded this week within the prevailing $315-325/st fob Nola range, though activity was limited given scant prompt application demand. There has been discussion of offers possibly as low as $310/st fob Nola, but no business has been confirmed lower than $315/st fob.\\nLast week, the Nola MOP assessment reached its lowest point since February 2014. The assessment is $43/st lower than this time last year on a midpoint basis. It has also dropped by $43/st since the beginning of 2015.\\nWarehouse prices were also flat on limited demand, with\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nCorn Belt prices still indicated at $360-375/st fot. Buyers are awaiting summer fill prices, which could be introduced by the end of the month. For now, Canadian producers are oc- cupied by fulfilling contractual standard MOP obligations to China and India while also shipping granular MOP tonnage to consignment warehouses within the US.\\nNorth American potash producers and buyers are looking to Brazil for signs of support for granular MOP prices globally. The Nola potash premium to Brazil stands at about $15/t, the slimmest margin since March 2014 and down by more than $30/t from March 2015.\\nImport data suggests Brazil still needs to buy a substantial amount of tonnage. Imports over the first five months of 2015 of 2.3mn t are down 30pc year-over-year, with Canada, Russia, Belarus and Chile all seeing a drop off in shipments, according to customs data. Market expectation is for more buying to take place, leading to higher Brazil cfr offers for July and August from producers, but upside could be limited by the depreciating real and unfavorable crop prices relative to fertilizer prices.\\nBrazilian potash demand fell by 17.9pc to 1.35mn t in the first five months of 2015 from the same period a year earlier, with domestic production up by 1.1pc and imports down\\nby nearly 25pc compared to the same five-month period of 2014, according to Brazilian fertilizer industry association Anda.\\nInternational potash highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Chile, SQM could be facing the revocation of its mining concessions in the Salar de Atacama by Corfo, the Chilean state-owned economic development agency. Salar Atacama is the source for SQM’s MOP and SOP products, among oth- ers. Its NOP-based products are sourced from outside the\\nSalar de Atacama and would theoretically be unaffected if SQM lost its concession. See Fertilizer news for more.\\n\\x84\\x84In India, ICL is understood to be close to finalizing supply contracts with Indian buyers, likely totaling near 680,000t. If confirmed, the commitments would bring total firm contracted tonnage to India to about 4.3mn t, with an ad- ditional 550,000t optional.\\n\\x84\\x84Allana Potash shareholders this week approved the acquisition of the company and its Ethiopian potash project by Israel’s ICL. ICL in March offered to buy all the outstand- ing shares of Allana for about $110mn. The transaction is expected to close around 22 June. The deal is subject to the approval of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice, among other conditions. The Ethiopian project has estimated ca- pacity of 1mn t/yr MOP, while preliminary studies into SOP production have also been made.\\nGlobal sulfur prices\\nSulfur and sulfuric acid\\nBrazil MOP imports\\nSulfur\\nThe US sulfur market is balanced, with no disruption stem- ming from heavy storms along the US Gulf coast. Tropical storm Bill hit the Texas coast 16 June, forcing Shell to evacu- ate personnel from its offshore facilities and causing minor\\n9.0refinery issues (see Operations News). But the actual impact on sulfur movements was negligible. Truck loadings from\\n8.7refineries were uninterrupted and domestic barge activity\\n8.4had no issues.\\n8.1\\n7.8\\nIn Canada, sulfur loadings at Syncrude’s facilities, which had been halted because of internal H2S limits, have resumed. The oil consortium stopped truck loadings last week at its\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nfacilities in the Alberta oil sands after restarting shipments just the week prior. Syncrude has revised its internal limits on H2S content from 30ppm to 50ppm, which likely contrib- uted to its ability to resume shipments.\\nInternational sulfur highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In China, new sales and firm bids have moved granular prices up slightly to a range of $162-165/t cfr China. End-us- ers in China confirm receiving offers in the low-$160s/t cfr. With freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-17/t (south- north China), the netback has moved up to the $150/t fob Middle East mark.\\nSulfuric acid\\nPCS will close its sulfur-burned sulfuric acid plant at Geis- mar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was \"most advantageous to the company.\" PCS is closing the facility because of expenses\\nneeded to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.\\nThe plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulfur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulfuric acid, and will now pro- cure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulfuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market participants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.\\nInternational sulfuric acid highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Cuba, the second sulfuric acid plant at Sherritt\\'s Moa facility is expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. The burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulfuric acid production capacity (around 667 t/d of sulfur consumption). Once operational, it will reduce its import requirements accordingly.\\nFertilizer news\\nCF to expand Courtright urea capacity\\nCF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.\\nDebottleneck work at Courtright\\'s existing urea plant will be- gin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quarter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Courtright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.\\nThe expansion will increase CF\\'s ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.\\nThe Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF\\'s nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF\\'s annual report.\\nChile’s SQM risks losing mining concession\\nCorfo, Chile´s state-owned economic development agency, is hardening its stance against SQM in an effort to strip the\\ncompany of its rich mining concession in the northern Chil- ean saltbed known as Salar de Atacama.\\nSQM and Corfo have been in arbitration over the matter since 16 May 2014. Corfo asserts that SQM has not honored concession payments and has blocked out competitors, claims that SQM has denied. In recent months, a tax fraud and illegal campaign finance scandal engulfing SQM have deepened the rift in the wake of a cabinet shake-up trig- gered by the ongoing controversy.\\nCorfo is expected to reject an arbitration judge´s recom- mendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seek- ing instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease. SQM said on 18 June that it has not been informed that Corfo plans to abandon the arbitration process.\\nThe Salar de Atacama is the source for SQM´s MOP, SOP, lithium carbonate, boric acid and magnesium chloride. Ac- cording to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of its consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Atacama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nWeather delays progress for wheat, soy: USDA\\nRainy weather over most of May delayed soybean plantings and the winter wheat harvest, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.\\nUS soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995. Rain over the last 30 days has been particularly heavy in both states with areas in east Kansas and northwest Missouri receiving more than 12 inches during that span, according to the National Weather Service. All other 16 of the top 18 producing states are within at least two percentage points of the average.\\nSoybeans were 75pc emerged the week ended 14 June, two percentage points behind the five-year average, again pulled down by Kansas (30pc) and Missouri (28pc). Soybean condi- tions were in line with historical data, however, with 67pc of the crop rated good or excellent.\\nWinter wheat conditions were not as strong, with 22pc of the crop rated poor and very poor, up from 20pc the previ- ous week. Good and excellent ratings were in line with the previous week at 43pc.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year average for the second straight week. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average.\\nOklahoma (38pc) and Arkansas (39pc), which had both seen heavy storms through the end of May and early June, were 19pc and 17pc behind their respective harvesting averages.\\nSpring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent, unchanged from the previous week, with only 4pc of the crop rated poor and very poor.\\nThe number of days suitable for fieldwork was mixed the week ended 14 June, especially in the Corn Belt. Illinois (2.3), Indiana (3.2) and Iowa (3.2) all saw less days week- over-week for fieldwork, while Kansas (4.4) Kentucky (5.8) and Missouri (3) showed improvement.\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nPlantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 91pc completed, down from the 96pc average, while sorghum was 71pc planted, behind its 80pc average.\\nCME declares force majeure on corn, soy\\nCME Group declared force majeure for corn and soybean shipments because of high-water conditions on the Illinois river, preventing barge loadings. The area has seen recent heavy rains, which has made barge loading and movement difficult. CME said a majority of corn and soybean loading facilities are located along the Illinois river.\\nCalifornia curtails water use for farmers\\nRegulators cut water supply to California\\'s largest agricul- tural areas last week, the latest step in the state\\'s efforts to curtail water use during a historic drought.\\nThe State Water Resources Control Board announced 12 June that there is insufficient water to supply senior water right holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento areas.\\nCalifornia\\'s water rights are based on seniority. When the water system becomes insufficient to supply all right hold- ers, those with junior rights are forced to stop using water to accommodate senior users.\\n\"Some water right holders may have other, more senior rights to fall back on, or have water stored in reservoirs that they can still access,\" the board said. \"If that\\'s not available they will have to find other sources of water, such as ground- water or purchased water, if available.\"\\nOverall, 114 rights holder will be affected, including 86 along the Sacramento river, impacting the use for irrigation, stockwatering and livestock. The state first implemented water restriction in April, though those rules focused more on residential use and did not impact agriculture.\\nCalifornia had the highest revenue from agricultural pro- duction in the US in 2013 with $46.4bn, $15.2bn more than the next highest state, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\\nThe state will produce 1.9bn pounds of almonds in 2015, down just 1pc from 2014 despite the ongoing drought, ac- cording to the USDA. Area that will produce almonds is pro- jected to reach a record 890,000 acres, up 2.2pc from 2014, with a yield of 2,080 pounds/acre. One acre of almonds uses an estimated 250lbs of nitrogen, according to the University\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nof California, Davis. Comparatively, one acre of corn uses up to 180lbs of nitrogen. One acre of almonds also uses 150lbs of potash, 2-5lbs of boron and 10-15lbs of zinc.\\nPlantings for principal field crops – including corn, wheat and soybean – in the state are all in line with the historical five- year averages, and crop conditions are rated at least 85pc good to excellent, according to the USDA.\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nAnnouncement — email settings\\nArgus will soon change the email domain from which we send out reports to some subscribers.

       "'Argus FMB Sulphur\\nFormerly FMB Weekly Sulphur Report\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nMarket summary\\nPrices edge up steadily, but can buying from China last?\\nPrices have edged up in China and the Middle East this week, following a trend that has been observed in the past weeks. Compared with the yo-yo price trend last year, the current upward movement appears more steady.\\nIn China this week, various deals for granular sulphur were reported in the $160-163/t cfr range, showing a slight in- crease on last week. But majority of the buyers remain small to medium-sized fertilizer producers and traders; major players still bid at slightly lower values. Freight is estimated at $13-16/t between Middle East and China, it is therefore of no surprise that fob levels in the Middle East have also ticked up.\\nAramco Trading in Saudi Arabia has sold 35,000t of spot sul- phur to a trader in the high-$140s/t fob, and this is believed to be coming from Yasref for July loading in Yanbu. Qatar\\'s Tasweeq is thought to have made an award to a trader for second half July loading. Most bids were heard in the mid/ high-$140s/t fob leading to expectations of an award at under $150/t fob, however at press time there were strong indications that the deal had been concluded at $151/t fob.\\nWhen China failed to return to the spot market as antici-\\nSulphur freight\\nprICES\\ncpt = ‘carriage paid to’ for sulphur delivered by Roadtankcar\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\npated after the Chinese New Year in February, prices eroded slightly but did not enter a free-fall. Some argue that it was down to a structural market tightness, which is expected to provide support to current sulphur prices and to potentially prevent prices from falling sharply even if Chinese buyers decided to exit the market in the next few weeks.\\nTaking into consideration the ramping up of Shah in the UAE and Yasref in Saudi Arabia as well as temporary demand loss from GCT, market prices globally have remain fairly steady since 2Q. Some attribute this to new sulphur production from Barzan/Qatar being delayed, Tengizchevroil\\'s block be- ing completely depleted, OCP taking more tonnes as the new sulphur burner for the 1mn t/yr fertilizer complex enters operation, Mosaic potentially taking solid sulphur soon for its Florida melter that is expected to come on line in 4Q15.\\nBut caution is still needed, as urged by many. While some suppliers maybe short and have paid higher fob prices to se- cure cargoes, there are also reports of others who have had to liquidate their position at below-market levels. The July price proposed by Aramco was welcomed by offtakers and the attention will soon switch to Tasweeq and ADNOC who are due to publish their monthly prices soon.\\nThird quarter contract negotiations have started in some places. Last few months the market saw stability across the globe, and most players agree that there are no big changes fundamentally to support a substantial shift in prices. This is with the exception of Kazakhstan, where sulphur inventory\\n-once as high as 9mn t back in 2009 - is depleted meaning producer TCO will have only its fresh production to offer to its contract buyers from this quarter onwards. The producer is said to be targeting an increase of $5-10/t for 3Q.\\nSulphur spot price comparison\\n$/t\\nJan 13 Jul 13 Jan 14 Jul 14 Jan 15\\nThis week’s highlights\\n\\x84\\x84High-end of China cfr moves up to $163/t based on latest spot deals\\n\\x84\\x84Molten sulphur prices indicated in the low-$140s/t to high-$150s/t cfr China\\n\\x84\\x84Stocks in China fell to 868,000t this week\\n\\x84\\x84FACT bought 25,000t from Swiss Singapore in the mid- $160s/t cfr\\n\\x84\\x84Coromandel reportedly bought in the mid-$160s/t cfr for early July arrival\\n\\x84\\x84A cargo with 35,000t of Yasref sulphur has been sold in the high-$140s/t fob Yanbu to a trader\\n\\x84\\x84Tasweeq\\'s tender in Qatar awarded, reportedly at just above $150/t fob\\n\\x84\\x84Initial third-quarter sulphur contract price discussions in the Middle East thought to fall in the 2Q range\\n\\x84\\x84IGCC in Iran sold crushed lump sulphur at $139/t fob Bandar Abbas\\n\\x84\\x84Indo Jordan asking for another cargo for first half July\\narrival\\n\\x84\\x84Benin looking for 10,000-12,000t for second half July load\\n\\x84\\x84NOC/Libya offering 8,000t for early July loading\\n\\x84\\x84European contracts for 3Q may not see significant move- ment from 2Q levels\\n\\x84\\x84Bayonne terminal in France still down on technical issues\\n\\x84\\x84Kazakhstan\\'s TCO to table increases on 3Q contracts as stocks depleted\\n\\x84\\x84Anglo American in Brazil in talks with suppliers for a spot August cargo, discussions at around $160/t cfr\\n\\x84\\x84Meranol in Argentina heard to have bought some spot tonnes\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPhosphate market summary\\nThe global phosphates market remains stable. Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively com- fortable suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.\\nAlthough the market is stable overall, there is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters. The pause in Brazil has been put down to two key reasons. The first reason being the avail- ability of the credit package announced by the govern- ment two weeks ago. Some argue that Brazilian demand inland has come to a halt as farmers are not willing to purchase any fertilizers until the credit announced by the government is available. There are reports that this could take as long as 45 days for the credit to appear in the banks.\\nThe second reason is the poor correlation between fertil- izer and soybean prices, which has been deterring farm- ers from purchasing fertilizers. Due to the lack of farmer demand, distributors are reluctant to build inventory until there is more movement inland.\\nA similar view is taken on India. Demand currently is slow as buyers are well-covered for the kharif season and importers feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to be lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable. But suppliers are not concerned about this slowdown as another estimated 2-2.5mn t is required for the rabi season, equivalent to an average of around 800,000 t/m for August-October. Of this, roughly 200,000- 250,000t could be met by the Saudis, Jordanians and possibly Russians leaving the Chinese with the lions share. Moreover, the monsoon is progressing well which is also providing an overall positive picture.\\nThe outlook remains stable-to-firm through 3Q.\\nChina sulphur stocks vs sulphur import price cfr\\nPrices pick up slightly\\nMost granular sulphur deals are reported in the low-$160s/t cfr this week, supported by end-users who confirm receiving offers at this level.\\nTwo fertilizer producers are believed to have bought an import cargo each, for July arrival, at around $160/t cfr.\\nA trader was close to concluding 20,000t of Middle East sulphur with a buyer at $162/t cfr at press time. The cargo is for end-June loading for shipment to Fangcheng.\\nAnother trader sold 60,000t of sulphur in total this week at as high as $163/t cfr.\\nOne deal is reported at just under $165/t cfr; a trader has sold 35,000t of Middle East sulphur to an end-user for July loading/August arrival. The consensus between market play- ers, however, is the mid-$160s/t cfr is not yet firmly estab- lished at the moment and the deal may have been agreed between a trader and its long-term contract holder.\\nWith freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-16/t (south- north China), the $160-163/t cfr range nets back to the high- $140s/t fob Middle East.\\nMolten sulphur prices are indicated in the low-$140s/t to the high-$150s/t cfr, following the trend of granular sulphur prices.\\nCrushed lump availability in China will be reduced as de- liveries from the Berri block to China will be halted during Ramadan.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphur\\nStocks totalled 868,000t this week, down on the 972,000t recorded last week:\\n\\x84\\x84Qingdao: 74,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Zhenjiang: 210,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Zhanjiang: 100,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Fangcheng: 146,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Nantong: 290,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Others: 48,000t\\nDomestic prices firming and moving above import offers\\nSales at the port of Nantong in China are firm at RMB 1,250/t exw for granular sulphur, with offers at RMB 1,260/t. Buyers have thus far been small and medium-sized fertilizer produc- ers and traders. Based on the current exchange rate ($1 to RMB6.21) the Nantong price is equivalent to the mid-$160s/t cfr, while many cfr offers for imported material are in the low-$160s/t cfr still.\\nSinopec\\'s Puguang gas field prices its sulphur at RMB 1,230/t ex-port Wanzhou, up by RMB 30/t on last week, and at RMB 1,190/t ex-works Dazhou, which is unchanged from the week before.\\nOperating rates at Puguang are not verified, with local reports suggesting 90,000-120,000 t/m. Around a month ago, production was estimated at 140,000 t/m, again down the rate of 160,000 t/m reported back in March/April.\\nCaution needed, warned market participants\\nThe latest cycle of sulphur price growth has been a con- trolled one, compared with the yo-yo price movement last year. Some has attributed this to steady demand in China. While operations at DAP and MAP plants in China have been stable in the past month or two - supported by a flat export tax rate for DAP/MAP exports - major fertilizer produc- ers are said to be covered having made quiet purchases previously in smaller lots. The current round of purchases is supported mainly by small and medium-sized fertilizer producers and traders. The worry now shared between some participants is how much room is left for prices to grow as buyers are expected to withdraw from the market again once they are covered.\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nNew supply, including production increase in the Middle East, is expected to be absorbed by fertilizer companies that are also expanding their capacity at least for this year. But this nevertheless contributed to a sentiment amongst some Chinese players - that the more new production is seen in the market, the lower prices of sulphur should be.\\nTaiwan\\nFormosa is not expected to be in the spot market until next month, when a sales tender for August loading should be floated.\\nIndia\\nTwo deals were finalised lately in India:\\n\\x84\\x84FACT bought 25,000t in the mid-$160s from Swiss Singa- pore for 6-10 July arrival against its recent tender.\\n\\x84\\x84Coromandel, or CIL, has reportedly bought a cargo of 10,000t from a trader in the mid-$160s/t cfr for early July arrival.

But delays — as yet unacknowledged by the field\\'s operator, state-controlled RasGas — may push start up to early 2016.\\nThe progress with Barzan does not only affect sulphur production from Qatar (discussed below) but also Qatar\\'s economic growth forecast.\\nLast week the Qatari ministry of development, planning and statistics lowering its official economic growth forecast to account for lower oil and LNG prices. The ministry said in an economic outlook that GDP will expand by 7.3pc in 2015 on the back of \"continued vigour of the non-hydrocarbon sector and the boost to upstream hydrocarbon production from the Barzan gas project.\" A version of the report issued in Decem- ber last year forecast 7.7pc growth in 2015. Qatar\\'s GDP grew by 6.1pc last year.\\n\"Much of the acceleration [in economic growth] in 2015 is attributable to additional output from the Barzan project, which will come on stream in the middle of the year,\" said the ministry of development planning report. The delay at Barzan undermines the ministry\\'s assumptions in its fore- cast and suggests GDP growth may prove less robust than expected this year. Barzan will be a more significant factor in 2016 and 2017 real growth.\\nThe project is a joint venture between state-owned QP and ExxonMobil. Market indications were pointing to around 500,000-1mn t of sulphur to be produced by Barzan 1 this year. Argus FMB takes a more conservative look and expects around 250,000 t/yr of new production from the plant in 2015, but we maintain that there is the potential for greater production.\\nUAE\\nSwiss Singapore loaded 41,500t on the MV Catamarca, sailed on 9 June for Aqaba.\\nOCP loaded 52,500t on the MV Abu El Abyad, sailed on 16 June for Morocco.\\nKuwait\\nVale loaded 31,500t on the MV RM Dynasty, sailed on 17 June for Brazil.\\nYUC loaded 27,500t on the MV Sea Harmony, sailed on 17 June for China.\\nTasweeq’s Qatar sulphur price fob Ras Laffan/Mesaieed\\n$/t\\n200196\\n140133\\n130127\\n119\\n120\\n110\\n100\\nIran\\nIGCC has made an award to a trader at $139/t fob Bandar Abbas for 30,000t of crushed lump sulphur for 1-10 July load- ing.\\nA tender for granular sulphur will be announced next week.\\nIn Bandar Abbas, China Oil loaded 33,000t on the MV Top Genius that sailed on 14 June for China.\\nJordan\\nIt is believed that Indo Jordan has floated another tender, also for 40,000t for early July delivery.

The refinery was shut for much of the second quarter of May for a full-scale maintenance shutdown, then a fire on 8 May led to the death of one employee.\\nMotoroil\\'s sulphur production is understood to be normal.\\nBank of Greece fears \\'uncontrollable crisis\\'\\nThe Greek central bank on 17 June warned that failure to reach agreement between international creditors and the government would lead to default, exit from the euro and probably the EU, so a \"manageable debt crisis\" would \"snow- ball into an uncontrollable crisis\".\\nThe bank said this would imply deep recession, a dramatic decline in income levels, an exponential rise in unemploy- ment, and Greece \"would see itself relegated to the rank of a poor country in the European south\".\\nTwo weeks remain for Greece and its creditors, the EU and the IMF, to reach agreement. Eurozone finance ministers meet on 18 June for further talks on the issue.\\nOn the sulphur side, the main concern is a potential Greek exit from the euro, which will affect any business that deals with the euro and other currencies.\\nTurkey\\nSince June, Tupras\\' Izmit refinery has been ramping up its new upgrading units that is designed to bring around 7,000- 9,000 t/m of sulphur. All sulphur production as part of the new upgrading units are to be bagged.\\nLast sale in Turkey is thought to be in the mid/high-$140s/t cfr.\\nWest Europe\\nLimited movement expected for 3Q contract prices\\nInitial discussions between the buy and sell sides suggest that the market has been stable and as a result, the ma- jority agrees that there is no reason to stage a significant price increase or decrease. The unexpected weakening of the euro against US dollars in early 2Q has been less of an issue at present, putting less pressure on those who procure sulphur in US dollars and sell their downstream products in euros. Depending on the seller and the buyer, some are keen to recoup the increases/decreases that was not achieved in the second quarter and are expected to table a few dollars above/below 2Q levels.\\nFrance\\nBayonne terminal down on technical problems\\nThe Sobegi 200,000 t/yr sulphur remelting terminal in Bay- onne, France, has stopped running for four weeks because of technical problems; it was in turnaround for four weeks back in April and as a result has built up stocks in Bayonne.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nFMB Spot Sales Selection - 18 June 2015\\nThe MV Kimberly C discharged 6,500t of Cepsa sulphur in Bayonne, France, this week for Adisseo against contract.

With the unplanned shutdown, the operator Adisseo is not expected to arrange any more sulphur ship- ments until the remelting facility restarts, now scheduled for next week.\\nLa Mede not producing sulphur yet at press time\\nTotal is restarting the 160,000 b/d La Mede refinery in France, including those units which were brought down by a major power outage on 5 June. But there was no sulphur production at the refinery yet at press time. Its production is estimated to be around 20,000 t/yr of sulphur.\\nThe company said the start up process, began on 15 June, takes several days.\\nA crude unit and a reformer, which were not affected by the power outage, were ordered to shut down late on 12 June, following a strike by members of the CGT trade union federation a day earlier. This order was reversed on Monday 15 June when there were sufficient non-striking workers to safely carry out normal refinery operations.\\nThe strike targets Total\\'s plan to end conventional refining at the site. La Mede will cease crude refinery operations by\\nthe end of 2016, and the loss of 20,000 t/yr of production from La Mede will be offset by Donges\\' new desulphurization capacity that will start up in end 2016.\\nStrategy Report:\\nWorld Sulphur Outlook to 2025\\nExamining the outlook of future supply and demand within the rapidly evolving sulphur market and exploring the impact on trade and prices.

With the overall market cited as being stabl, GPE is unlikely to be agreeing to any decreases; a rollover to slight increase is expected to be tabled by the sell side.\\nKazakhstan\\nKazakh sulphur producer TCO will be taking a different ap- proach and targeting a more substantial price increase as its sulphur block has already depleted. Latest official numbers show that in the first quarter of this year, TCO sold over 910,000t of sulphur, while it only produced 628,000t.

In comparison, TCO sold 3.8mn t of sulphur for the whole of 2014, while producing just 2.4mn t.\\nThere are unconfirmed reports that the producer is targeting an increase ranging from $5-10/t - reflecting the mid-$160s/t cfr on the high end for Brazil and North Africa.\\nLatin America\\nBrazil\\nAnglo American is heard in the market looking for 37,000t for August arrival.

But overall fertilizer traffic dipped by just 1.6pc across all the carriers to 6.9mn short tons (6.3mn metric tonnes) on the strength of a one-third\\nincrease in traffic on the US operations of Canadian National (CN). CN moved 307,552st of fertilizer inputs in the quarter.\\nRates for input chemicals declined at every carrier except CSX, where the cost to move fertilizer inputs gained 3.6pc to $9.03/st.\\nThe volume of super-phosphate solutions on most of the US operations of the Class I railroads and but overall sector\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nQuarterly Freight review: Rates\\ntraffic rose by 1.1pc to 5.7mn st because of a 48pc reduc- tion in Kansas City Southern traffic. The small Class I moved 10,191st of coal in the quarter compared with 19,739 in first quarter 2014. The stronger volume environment at most of the carriers supported higher rates for super-phosphate solu- tions at a majority of the carriers. Overall rates added 2.4pc to $31.61/st across all the railroads.\\nThe western railroads took stronger price increases on their\\ntraffic than the average with BNSF rates up by 7.2pc to\\n$44.25/st in first quarter 2015 while Union Pacific (UP) pric- ing gained 3.9pc. Shippers of fertilizer chemicals and super- phosphates ended first quarter 2015 at $48.82/st.\\nRates in the east were mixed, but lower on an absolute level than their western counterparts, at least in part because of shorter lengths of haul.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nFundamentals\\nAgriculture\\nWeather: Tropical Storm Bill pushed through the Texas coast this week, though the state did not sustain flood dam-\\nage similar to that induced by heavy storms at the end of May. Storms in the Midwest were much more pronounced, stretching from the Mississippi Delta to the upper Northeast. While precipitation dissipated over most of the country by mid-week, rainfall hung over east Texas and Missouri, whose crop progress is already well behind the five-year average. The 6-10 day forecast shows unusually dry weather through- out the south and Mississippi Delta, though most of the Corn Belt and Northeast should see rainfall, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Temperatures will also likely rise to above-average marks in the lower Atlantic and southern Corn Belt. The western Corn Belt and plains are expected to stay dry and show average temperatures in the next 6-10 days.\\nCrop progress: Plantings and crop conditions were mostly\\n6-10 day precipitation outlook\\nin line with previous weekly reports and five-year averages, though soybean plantings still trail their average rates, especially in Missouri and Kansas, which have seen an unusu- ally large amount of rain. US soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year aver- age for the second straight week, likely slowed by inclem- ent weather since the end of May. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average. Winter wheat conditions were rated 22pc poor and very poor, while good and excellent ratings were 43pc of the total crop. Spring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent.\\n— USDA\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nCrop prices: Storms in the US Gulf coast and Midwest proved bullish from front-month crop prices this week, especially for soybeans. With soybean plantings lagging and weather threatening late-season plantings, front-month soybean futures prices ended the week at $9.78/bushel, the highest close for the contract since 5 May. November soybean prices also climbed, ending the week at $9.42/bushel, the highest mark since 8 May and up nearly 40¢/bushel from early-week settlements.\\nAmmonia margin vs natural gas\\nHenry Hub (left scale) $/mnBtu\\nAmmonia producer margin (right scale) $/st\\nFront-month corn prices also climbed on weather concerns. July corn prices ended the week at $3.58/bushel, a 10¢/ bushel rally from earlier in the week. December corn prices held steady week-on-week, fall 2¢/bushel to settle 18 June at 3.73/bushel.\\nFeedstock\\nUS natural gas futures ended lower this week on a govern- ment report of a larger-than-average build in gas stockpiles and forecasts for milder weather in the coming weeks.\\nNymex gas for July delivery fell by 7.8¢/mmBtu, or 2.7pc, to settle at $2.777/mmBtu. Prompt-month prices rose to a four-week settlement high earlier this week but surrendered some of those gains ahead of the US Energy Information Administration\\'s (EIA) weekly inventory report.\\nUS gas stockpiles rose in the week ended 12 June by 89 Bcf (2.5bn m³), the EIA said. The build was smaller than the previous three injections, all of which exceeded 100 Bcf, be- cause of hotter weather. Last week\\'s injection fell short of analyst estimates for an increase of 92 Bcf, but it surpassed the five-year average injection for the week of 87 Bcf.\\nInventories have increased rapidly this year on increased domestic output. Stockpiles last week rose to 2.433 Tcf — 43pc higher than a year earlier and 1.9pc above the five-year average.\\nThe US rig count reached a 12-year low as weak oil prices forced producers to pull back drilling, but the shale indus- try\\'s run is far from over, oil major BP said.\\nThe rig count fell by nine to 859 this week, according to data from oilfield services company Baker Hughes. That\\'s the low-\\nest since 17 January 2003 when it fell to 845. It surpassed the lowest level of the previous market crash of 2008-09, when it dropped to 876 on 12 June 2009.\\nThe US shale boom allowed the US to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world\\'s largest oil producer and Russia as the larg- est producer of oil and gas, BP said in its annual Statistical Review said. US output increased by 1.6mn b/d last year, making the country the first ever to boost output by at least 1mn b/d a year for three consecutive years.\\nFreight\\nFertilizer barge movements on most US rivers have slowed as a surge in high water has made navigation difficult and forced the closure of several locks and dams.\\nRecent rains in some northern tier states, including Michi- gan, Minnesota and North Dakota, helped create runoff to the rivers that drove up water levels on the Illinois and up- per Mississippi rivers.\\nTwo Illinois river locks have been shut, preventing barges from moving north or south through the Starved Rock lock in Utica and the Marseilles lock in Marseilles. Barges continue to pass through high water at the Peoria lock in Creve Coeur and the LaGrange lock in Versailles because those locations have wicket dams that have been lowered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Dams at other locks are more perma- nent, requiring those sites to close in the high water.\\nBarge rates were unchanged this week after rising recently because of the high water and efforts by operators to limit storage.

Many are wary of releasing too much equipment this summer because they want to be sure to meet contract customer needs, a concern generated by last fall’s tight market.\\nSt Louis barge rates held for a second week at $9-10.75/short ton. Barges continue to pass through the area but that may change if high water in the area persists.\\nIf there is more rain in the next few days, operators may hold back northbound barges heading to the upper Mississip- pi and Illinois rivers for safety reasons. The Mississippi gauge at St Louis this morning was 33.2ft, above flood level of 30ft, and is expected to peak at 37.1ft by 22 June.\\nA tropical depression is heading for the for the middle Mis- sissippi and Ohio river valleys after making landfall along the central Texas coast on 16 June as a tropical storm before weakening.\\nArkansas river barge traffic has again been slowed by high water, less than 10 days after the corps reopened all locks from a similar problem. The Mayo lock near Fort Smith, Arkansas, has been shut, blocking fertilizer barges heading\\nnorth towards Muskogee and Inola/Catoosa.\\nBarge rates to destinations between Pine Bluff and Little Rock were flat at $14.50-16.50/st after increasing last week. Traffic along the waterway remains restricted to six-barge tows that can only be operated in daylight.\\nNitrogen\\nSustained rice demand and short-covering sustained higher loaded/prompt urea prices this week, but July values were under pressure amid concerns of higher imports and im- pending domestic production increases. Meanwhile, UAN and other nitrogen products have seen a steadier decline to summer reset values.\\nUrea (g)\\nThe urea barge market again traded in a wide range as traders placed a premium on loaded product, particularly as some scrambled to cover first-half June contract commit- ments.\\nThat premium led to multiple loaded barge trades at $380/ st fob Nola, up by $10/st from the high end of last week’s assessment and marking the highest point since 17 July 2014. Prompt/June-loading barges trended in line with the prior week, trading from $346-355/st fob Nola, with prices held up by rice demand in the south and the last tail of corn top- dress demand.\\nJuly prices were harder to pin down because of scarce bids. First-half July, CF-specific barges traded at $320/st fob Nola and July non-Chinese traded at $314/st fob. But offers for first-half July dropped from the low/mid-$310s/st fob Nola mid-week to $305/st as of press time, setting the bottom end of this week’s assessment. In addition, an August-loading non-Chinese barge traded at $292/st fob Nola, nearly a $100/ st below loaded prices this week.\\nThe lack of July buying interest came as traders assess a growing import lineup—a function of the $100/st price rally since April—most of which is likely to arrive after late-season demand has concluded. At least 260,000t of granular urea is estimated to arrive in July, with Saudi Arabia’s Sabic now planning to bring 60,000t to Nola in late July—its first of 10 cargoes for the US for the 2015-16 fertilizer year.\\nThe US typically imports less urea in July because of an ebb in seasonal demand. However, it did import 250,000t during\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPrices\\nJuly 2014 by vessel, compared to just 81,000t in 2013. In ad- dition to the estimated 260,000t for this July, a few vessels remain up in the air, with additional shipments from Algeria and Kuwait possible.\\nContinued barge delays on the Arkansas river kept ware- house prices firm in Inola/Catoosa and St Louis. Inola/ Catoosa urea inventory is nearing depletion with those with remaining tons consistently achieving $415/st fot. Only a few thousand tons are estimated still in Inola/Catoosa and barge resupply is still a ways off because of high-water restricting traffic on the Arkansas river (see Freight). The shortage in Inola/Catoosa has pulled prices up in St Louis, which climbed as high as $390/st fot as buyers look to truck urea from that hub to southern destinations. Northeastern Arkansas warehouses on the Mississippi river have also achieved $410/ st fot.\\nPrices in Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities were un- changed amid limited activity.\\nIn projects, CF Industries will add 130,000 st/yr of granular urea/DEF/urea liquor capacity to its Courtright, Ontario,\\nEstimated incoming urea vessels\\nplant through a debottlenecking project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Seller price indications have increased to at or near $240/t cfr, particularly as a summer turnaround of a Russian producer’s facility has removed some cargoes from the typical US lineup. However, potential buyers are resist- ing prices above the $235/t cfr mark.\\nAlthough movement to the field has been limited, terminal prices have yet to move toward summer fill values—likely because the remaining inventory was purchased at higher, in-season values.

Given the nationwide tight- ness of amsul, some are not ruling out the possibility of flat summer pricing. In the Northern Plains, fill prices have been discussed around $300-310/st delivered, depending on loca- tion.\\nAmsul production on the Texas Gulf Coast was minimally impacted by Tropical Storm Bill, which made landfall on 16 June southwest of Houston. Producers reported normal load- ing operations during the storm.\\nAmmonia\\nPrices in the US ammonia market continued to soften this week with the end of side dress season hastened by a sud- den and severe bout of wet weather hitting the east Corn Belt. Corn is now expected to be too tall for further ap- plications by the time saturated soils have dried out. This has caused an earlier than expected cutoff for offtake this season, and could result in increased carryout for suppliers in the region.\\nEast Corn Belt prices moved to $590-610/st fot, a $10/st decline from last week’s range. There was little if any buying at these levels, but offers have drifted only marginally lower given the tight inventory situation.\\nIn the west Corn Belt there has been little or no business concluded and prices are still discussed in the wide range of $525-590/st fot, with the high end farther east.\\nDistributors have yet to move to summer fill values as there is little sense of urgency to sell with inventories lean despite\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n* Indicates confirmation with Zepol import/export database.\\nValues without * are estimates based on vessel size and/or previous shipments.\\n— Genscape\\nthe weather-shortened season.

These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.\\nThe US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.\\nThe US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.\\nCanada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same month last year.

India received 52.4pc of all US shipments, with Brazil, Mexico and Canada rounding out the remaining supply. Phosphoric acid exports for the calen- dar year-to-date are down 18.5pc to 111,233st P2O5.\\nDAP/MAP\\nDAP barge prices were steady this week with trades for July-loading domestic tons at $419/st fob Nola. Bid/offers for physical barges bracketed either side of that level, upholding the prior $418-420/st fob Nola range. A domestic DAP barge traded this week at $425/st fob Nola, but was excluded from the range because of specific circumstances that made it not representative of the market, according to the seller. No MAP trades were confirmed, but the product continues to be indicated at a $5-10/st premium to DAP.\\nDAP/MAP warehouse demand is seasonally limited and prices unchanged from last week. Some wholesalers still have post- ed DAP prices of $460-465/st fot, particularly on the Ohio river, but no substantial sales at that level were confirmed.\\nInternational phosphate highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, phosphate-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a decline in demand in sugar cane and second- crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy planting season which begins in September, according to industry association Anda. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period. Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009,\\n0\\naccording to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increas- ing. This sluggishness has contributed to a bearish tone in prices, with MAP offers dipping as low as $490s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84In Argentina, a trader sold 30,000t Australian DAP at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment, while China’s YUC sold June MAP at $500-505/t cfr to this market.\\n\\x84\\x84China produced 4.3mn t of DAP and 2.9mn t of MAP in the first quarter, which are year-over-year increases of 17pc and 13pc, respectively, according to the China Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry. China exported 935,000t DAP and 481,000t MAP in the first quarter, according to customs data--both substantially higher year-over-year because of the country\\'s move to a flat year-round export tax.\\nPotash\\nThe North American market remains in a seasonal lull ahead of formal summer fill price announcements.\\nNon-Belarusian import barges for June/July-loading traded this week within the prevailing $315-325/st fob Nola range, though activity was limited given scant prompt application demand. There has been discussion of offers possibly as low as $310/st fob Nola, but no business has been confirmed lower than $315/st fob.\\nLast week, the Nola MOP assessment reached its lowest point since February 2014. The assessment is $43/st lower than this time last year on a midpoint basis. It has also dropped by $43/st since the beginning of 2015.\\nWarehouse prices were also flat on limited demand, with\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nCorn Belt prices still indicated at $360-375/st fot. Buyers are awaiting summer fill prices, which could be introduced by the end of the month. For now, Canadian producers are oc- cupied by fulfilling contractual standard MOP obligations to China and India while also shipping granular MOP tonnage to consignment warehouses within the US.\\nNorth American potash producers and buyers are looking to Brazil for signs of support for granular MOP prices globally. The Nola potash premium to Brazil stands at about $15/t, the slimmest margin since March 2014 and down by more than $30/t from March 2015.\\nImport data suggests Brazil still needs to buy a substantial amount of tonnage. Imports over the first five months of 2015 of 2.3mn t are down 30pc year-over-year, with Canada, Russia, Belarus and Chile all seeing a drop off in shipments, according to customs data. Market expectation is for more buying to take place, leading to higher Brazil cfr offers for July and August from producers, but upside could be limited by the depreciating real and unfavorable crop prices relative to fertilizer prices.\\nBrazilian potash demand fell by 17.9pc to 1.35mn t in the first five months of 2015 from the same period a year earlier, with domestic production up by 1.1pc and imports down\\nby nearly 25pc compared to the same five-month period of 2014, according to Brazilian fertilizer industry association Anda.\\nInternational potash highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Chile, SQM could be facing the revocation of its mining concessions in the Salar de Atacama by Corfo, the Chilean state-owned economic development agency. Salar Atacama is the source for SQM’s MOP and SOP products, among oth- ers. Its NOP-based products are sourced from outside the\\nSalar de Atacama and would theoretically be unaffected if SQM lost its concession. See Fertilizer news for more.\\n\\x84\\x84In India, ICL is understood to be close to finalizing supply contracts with Indian buyers, likely totaling near 680,000t. If confirmed, the commitments would bring total firm contracted tonnage to India to about 4.3mn t, with an ad- ditional 550,000t optional.\\n\\x84\\x84Allana Potash shareholders this week approved the acquisition of the company and its Ethiopian potash project by Israel’s ICL. ICL in March offered to buy all the outstand- ing shares of Allana for about $110mn. The transaction is expected to close around 22 June. The deal is subject to the approval of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice, among other conditions. The Ethiopian project has estimated ca- pacity of 1mn t/yr MOP, while preliminary studies into SOP production have also been made.\\nGlobal sulfur prices\\nSulfur and sulfuric acid\\nBrazil MOP imports\\nSulfur\\nThe US sulfur market is balanced, with no disruption stem- ming from heavy storms along the US Gulf coast. Tropical storm Bill hit the Texas coast 16 June, forcing Shell to evacu- ate personnel from its offshore facilities and causing minor\\n9.0refinery issues (see Operations News). But the actual impact on sulfur movements was negligible. Truck loadings from\\n8.7refineries were uninterrupted and domestic barge activity\\n8.4had no issues.\\n8.1\\n7.8\\nIn Canada, sulfur loadings at Syncrude’s facilities, which had been halted because of internal H2S limits, have resumed. The oil consortium stopped truck loadings last week at its\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nfacilities in the Alberta oil sands after restarting shipments just the week prior. Syncrude has revised its internal limits on H2S content from 30ppm to 50ppm, which likely contrib- uted to its ability to resume shipments.\\nInternational sulfur highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In China, new sales and firm bids have moved granular prices up slightly to a range of $162-165/t cfr China. End-us- ers in China confirm receiving offers in the low-$160s/t cfr. With freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-17/t (south- north China), the netback has moved up to the $150/t fob Middle East mark.\\nSulfuric acid\\nPCS will close its sulfur-burned sulfuric acid plant at Geis- mar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was \"most advantageous to the company.\" PCS is closing the facility because of expenses\\nneeded to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.\\nThe plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulfur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulfuric acid, and will now pro- cure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulfuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market participants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.\\nInternational sulfuric acid highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Cuba, the second sulfuric acid plant at Sherritt\\'s Moa facility is expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. The burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulfuric acid production capacity (around 667 t/d of sulfur consumption). Once operational, it will reduce its import requirements accordingly.\\nFertilizer news\\nCF to expand Courtright urea capacity\\nCF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.\\nDebottleneck work at Courtright\\'s existing urea plant will be- gin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quarter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Courtright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.\\nThe expansion will increase CF\\'s ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.\\nThe Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF\\'s nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF\\'s annual report.\\nChile’s SQM risks losing mining concession\\nCorfo, Chile´s state-owned economic development agency, is hardening its stance against SQM in an effort to strip the\\ncompany of its rich mining concession in the northern Chil- ean saltbed known as Salar de Atacama.\\nSQM and Corfo have been in arbitration over the matter since 16 May 2014. Corfo asserts that SQM has not honored concession payments and has blocked out competitors, claims that SQM has denied. In recent months, a tax fraud and illegal campaign finance scandal engulfing SQM have deepened the rift in the wake of a cabinet shake-up trig- gered by the ongoing controversy.\\nCorfo is expected to reject an arbitration judge´s recom- mendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seek- ing instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease. SQM said on 18 June that it has not been informed that Corfo plans to abandon the arbitration process.\\nThe Salar de Atacama is the source for SQM´s MOP, SOP, lithium carbonate, boric acid and magnesium chloride. Ac- cording to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of its consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Atacama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nWeather delays progress for wheat, soy: USDA\\nRainy weather over most of May delayed soybean plantings and the winter wheat harvest, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.\\nUS soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995. Rain over the last 30 days has been particularly heavy in both states with areas in east Kansas and northwest Missouri receiving more than 12 inches during that span, according to the National Weather Service. All other 16 of the top 18 producing states are within at least two percentage points of the average.\\nSoybeans were 75pc emerged the week ended 14 June, two percentage points behind the five-year average, again pulled down by Kansas (30pc) and Missouri (28pc). Soybean condi- tions were in line with historical data, however, with 67pc of the crop rated good or excellent.\\nWinter wheat conditions were not as strong, with 22pc of the crop rated poor and very poor, up from 20pc the previ- ous week. Good and excellent ratings were in line with the previous week at 43pc.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year average for the second straight week. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average.\\nOklahoma (38pc) and Arkansas (39pc), which had both seen heavy storms through the end of May and early June, were 19pc and 17pc behind their respective harvesting averages.\\nSpring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent, unchanged from the previous week, with only 4pc of the crop rated poor and very poor.\\nThe number of days suitable for fieldwork was mixed the week ended 14 June, especially in the Corn Belt. Illinois (2.3), Indiana (3.2) and Iowa (3.2) all saw less days week- over-week for fieldwork, while Kansas (4.4) Kentucky (5.8) and Missouri (3) showed improvement.\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nPlantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 91pc completed, down from the 96pc average, while sorghum was 71pc planted, behind its 80pc average.\\nCME declares force majeure on corn, soy\\nCME Group declared force majeure for corn and soybean shipments because of high-water conditions on the Illinois river, preventing barge loadings. The area has seen recent heavy rains, which has made barge loading and movement difficult. CME said a majority of corn and soybean loading facilities are located along the Illinois river.\\nCalifornia curtails water use for farmers\\nRegulators cut water supply to California\\'s largest agricul- tural areas last week, the latest step in the state\\'s efforts to curtail water use during a historic drought.\\nThe State Water Resources Control Board announced 12 June that there is insufficient water to supply senior water right holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento areas.\\nCalifornia\\'s water rights are based on seniority.

Since late January, urea prices have dropped a further €10/t in Germany, France and Spain, and about €25/t in Italy. But urea prices appear to be set for a short rally, with traders covering short sales and taking some long positions for February shipment.\\nThere has been some softening in nitrates prices, but not comparable with urea. The upshot of this is that AN and CAN look overpriced per unit N, relative to urea, and the markets expect producers to drop their prices to restore some bal- ance. CAN stocks are fairly high in most countries at present, and there is some hope amongst those with stocks that price drops will be delayed until existing stocks have been sold.\\nThe euro strengthened significantly this week, to €1.12/$ at press time. For much of last month it ranged between €1.08- 1.09/$. This improves the outlook for business somewhat\\n-importers will find dollar-priced fertilizers slightly cheaper.\\nAt the same time, much of the requirement for the com- ing season has been booked already, and the outlook is for weaker fertilizer prices in the medium term, so it may not prompt much stock-building.\\nHighlights\\n\\x84\\x84GERMANY - Urea and DAP prices fall, while CAN, UAN and NPK prices are stable\\nprICES\\nDAP country comparison\\n\\x84\\x84FRANCE - Urea, UAN and DAP prices slip but AN/CAN prices hold\\n\\x84\\x84UK - AN competitive, limited success for planned PK/NPK price increases\\n\\x84\\x84ITALY - Urea prices fall, nitrates, phosphates and NPKs also soften\\n\\x84\\x84SPAIN - Limited business as weather inclement\\nCopyright © 2016 Argus Media group\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\ntrade flows\\nTunisia - Ireland\\nAbout 6,000t of DAP to load next week for shipment to Ireland.\\nRussia - France/Belgium\\nAgronova loading three vessels with 38,000t of UAN 32 for shipment to Ghent, Rouen and La Pallice.

Producer stocks are mounting as production facilities continue to run while retailers and wholesalers are understood to be sitting on high levels of unsold stock. Long positions are seen at all levels of the supply chain and no buying will take place until the season begins. With the first application covered and product already delivered to the farmer, the next round of buying is not expected to take place until March/April for the second and third applications.\\nThe lacklustre demand has seen urea and DAP prices con- tinue to trend down, while downwards pressure is also being placed on prices of all other products. For now, prices for CAN, UAN and NPKs are holding, mainly due to a lack of business.\\nto the sales but there are unconfirmed reports that Belor has been offering this product at €225/t fca Ghent.\\nThe restart of OCI\\'s Geleen CAN plant is due to begin next week but OCI has not yet started to offer any of this fresh tonnage until the restart is further progressed. No significant volumes are expected until end-March/April at the earliest.\\nUAN\\nPrices continue to be indicated at €173-175/t fca/ex-tank Hamburg amid a lack of business. Tanks are full with suppli- ers awaiting the application season to begin before starting deliveries in order to free up storage space.\\nASN\\nThere is very little interest for ASN now with most of the 2015-16 requirements already booked. It is estimated that only around 10pc of total requirements for this fertilizer year still needs to be purchased. Prices of ASN are still indi- cated at around €265/t cif inland.\\nCAN\\nPrices continue to be indicated at €225-230/t cif inland. West European producers are reported to be offering at €228-230/t cif inland but buyers wanting large quantities are likely able to achieve a lower price. But there is no new business. It will likely remain this way until farmers begin to replenish stocks. Uncertainty over the direction of the CAN price is also deterring buyers from the market. Distributors are hopeful that prices will be maintained through March to allow CAN already priced and in store to be applied. If there is any adjustment to the CAN price, it will likely take place in time for the second or third application.\\nOn imports, NF Trading is understood to have delivered around 25,000t of Ukrainian CAN into Ghent late January, which has all been sold to Belor. No price has been attached\\nGermany product comparison\\nDAP fca $/t (RH Axis)\\nUrea\\nGranular urea prices remain soft and have dropped to €230- 235/t fca, compared with €240-250/t fca two weeks ago. Some small lots are reported to have been concluded within this range for February-March delivery open origin, but most buyers are reluctant to buy in a falling market. It is thought that prices below this level may be achievable for delivery end-March/April.\\nForwards sales of granular urea are also being offered for June 2016-January 2017 delivery at the suppliers\\' option at prices around €220-225/t fca. But there is little uptake of this offer as buyers remain cautious amid weak sentiment in the international market.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nPrilled urea is on offer at €219-223/t fca German Baltic Sea ports. Again, there is very little interest on the buy side.\\nTrammo is in the freight market to load around 6,000t of urea in Ust Luga on 6-8 February for shipment to Lubeck.\\nDAP\\nDAP prices are indicated slightly lower this week at $420- 425/t fca while a small rally in the value of the euro versus the US dollar late this week will also push prices down further in euro terms. But there has been no firm business lately and such prices are only indicative. Some market players believe that prices sub-$420/t fca may be achievable in this current environment. Material is not required for ap- plication until April although bulk blenders will need product slightly earlier so there is still time to buy. Moreover, weak international DAP prices are keeping buyers on the sidelines, uncertain of the right moment to step in.\\nNPKs\\nThere is little interest in NPKs at the moment but some buying is expected to emerge March/early April for spring application. The price of 15-15-15 continues to be indicated at around €335-340/t cif inland. Borealis continues to hold its 15-15-15 price at €340/t cif inland while Polish 15-15-15 is also offered within this range.\\nBorealis is also offering NP 20-20-0 at a similar price to 15-\\n15-15 while its 28-8-8 and 14-10-20 grades are indicated €10/t lower.\\nPhosAgro is understood to have recently delivered a small parcel of 15-15-15 and NP 20-20-0 to Germany.\\nPotash\\nK+S\\' KornKali is priced at €244/t cif inland for February, ris- ing by €4/t from its January price. Another €4/t increase is scheduled each month for March and April. These increases are in contrast to the price trend seen for granular MOP, where prices are under pressure. Last indications for granu- lar MOP are at €280-285/t fca Antwerp/Ghent.\\nFrance\\nAN/CAN static, Urea/UAN/DAP dip further\\nThe French nitrates market has remained quiet awaiting the start of application in the next\\ntwo weeks. Market prices for AN/CAN are unchanged but much lower urea prices are expected to result in a correc- tion in nitrate prices when the existing high-priced stocks have been depleted.\\nSome urea business has taken place at €220-224/t fca, but the rally in the market in midweek means that some offers have been withdrawn. It is still too early to say whether this signals an end to the downward spiral in urea prices. But what is clear, is that the current gap between urea (and UAN) and CAN/AN is too large and has to be addressed.\\nPhosphate prices have also continued to trend lower in- ternationally and this has had a knock-on effect on offers into France. Offers are some $15/t lower than in January at $420-425/t fca, the equivalent of €375-380/t fca, but the fall has come too late to have much influence on spring demand. MOP suppliers are facing very sluggish demand and are re- ducing prices continually to take orders.\\nAN\\nThe AN 33.5pc market is unchanged. There is no demand for fresh lots. Distributors and farmers have stocks they are waiting to move when application starts later this month.\\nPrices for French-produced AN remain at €300-303/t cpt bulk. Supply to the French market appears good and buyers are waiting for new producer prices from Yara. The producer is understood to be sold out for the next two weeks and is\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Fertilizer Europe\\nonly offering for second half February delivery.\\nBorealis is booked through February and should begin offer- ing March tonnes shortly. In contrast, Eurochem has product available from stock to sell.\\nBuyers are expecting market prices to move lower in France, following the downtrend in urea prices. This is not expected to happen until wholesalers and retailers have depleted stocks and are ready to re-fill inventories. The gap between delivered prices of AN and urea is currently some €50/t, which is highly likely to impact future AN prices.\\nAN imports are quoted at around €270-275/t fca but buyers will not confirm new purchases until they know what domes- tic prices will be for the next sales.\\nCAN\\nThe situation for the CAN 27pc market is similar to AN, in that prices are unchanged at €248-250/t cpt bulk. The larger than normal price gap between CAN and urea remains an issue and French distributors will be looking for a price cor- rection ahead of the next round of purchasing in March.\\nSupply remains adequate in spite of OCI’s prolonged out- age at its 1.4mn t/yr Geleen unit. OCI is planning to restart the first line on 8 February and if all goes smoothly the unit should be fully operational by the second-half of March.\\nIn the meantime, the French CAN market is still at a stand- still waiting for the application season to begin. Farmers are expected to start applying nitrogen fertilizers in the next two weeks if the weather permits. So far this spring, the weather has been extremely mild and applications could well start earlier than normal. However, this will depend on how much rain there is as too much rainfall will limit spreading.\\nUAN\\nUAN 30 prices have dropped over the past week, with sales made at €155-157/t fca Rouen for February-April delivery. The price has fallen to the level implied by the most recent sale in Egypt - $140/t fob - even though only 5,000t were sold from there and not for France.\\nStocks in Rouen and throughout the distribution chain are high awaiting the application season to begin around 10-15 February.\\nForward offers appeared in the market this week at around €145/t fca Rouen for June to October delivery. It is not clear\\nif there is any volume behind these levels as yet as it could be traders testing the market. The price is equivalent to about $130/t fob Egypt.\\nThe 2015-16 season is shaping up to be a strong one. The French UAN solutions market is estimated to be about 90pc covered based on usage of approximately 2.2-2.3mn t in a normal year. Sales are expected to exceed this level because of some switching away from higher-priced AN/CAN. But it is still too early to estimate by how much.\\nAbu Qir will hold a sales tender on 8 February for 25,000t of UAN for 11-15 February loading. The last tender saw one 5,000t lot sold at $140/t fob to Trammo for Spain. Abu Qir told bidders its breakeven price is $140/t fob.\\nThe next tender will test that level again. The US market is paying no better than $130/t fob Egypt/Black Sea and it is not clear whether anyone in France has space for 25,000t of UAN for prompt shipment.\\nRussian producers are supplying European markets in Febru- ary. Eurochem will load 35,000-40,000t of UAN 32 in Novo- rossisk in February for Rouen/Ghent. It is checking freight, with rate indications in the high-$10s/t for Black Sea-France, and has also fixed 15,000t to load in Klaipeda for Rouen at $19/t.\\nAgronova has fixed several vessels for February loading in Sillamae, including 10,000t to La Pallice at $26-27/t; 18,000t to Rouen at $21/t; 10,000t to Ghent at $20/t; and 33,000- 35,000t for the US east coast at $35-36/t.\\nUrea\\nGranular urea prices in France have been following the inter- national market lower.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Fertilizer Europe\\nOffer prices dropped to €220-224/t fca this week, helped by the stronger euro, which moved back up to $1.11-1.12 on Thursday. Demand is largely covered for February, with urea still in store in major ports to meet it, and new buying is for March-April arrival.\\nA 25,000t Kuwaiti granular urea cargo has been booked for second half February loading that is expected to move to France. Freight is estimated at $17-18/t Shuaiba-French Bay.\\nAmeropa was in the freight market for 4,000t of Algerian urea for shipment to Sete during 25-30 January.\\nThe turnaround in the market this week meant that some traders withdrew low offers and began indicating at higher levels of €230-235/t fca La Pallice. This is equivalent to the $224/t fob paid in Egypt most recently for February loading. Egyptian urea sold out quickly when it became evident the market was turning. Some Algerian urea remains to be sold, however.\\nAround 60pc of the French urea market is estimated to have already been covered with some 450,000-480,000t still to be purchased for the balance of the winter cereal season and the upcoming corn application in May-June.\\nTraders have begun to offer granular urea for delivery in the second half of 2016, with quotes at €225/t fca in larger ports for delivery July-December at suppliers’ option. The price nets back to $212-215/t fob Egypt at current exchange rates, or about $190/t fob Middle East.\\nDAP/TSP\\nDAP prices have corrected downwards this week by around €15/t, with offers sinking to €380-385/t fca Rouen. This is down from at €395-400/t fca in late January. Suppliers, keen to get orders, are fighting for market share. The drop in price has however come too late to be of much use this sea- son as raw materials for blending have largely been covered.\\nLesser competition in the TSP market has kept market prices steady at around $355/t fca Rouen for February.\\nMOP\\nBuying interest for granular MOP has remained minimal. Competition for sales from all suppliers is strong and spot offers in in Rouen are around €2/t lower at €276-278/t fca in line with lower offers into Benelux ports. Distributors are wary of committing to new sales as the price of urea and DAP continues to fall.\\nAN imports stall, no price increase for NPKs\\nApplication time is imminent in some areas –\\nbut some farmers still appear to be reluctant to commit to purchases of nitrogen products. With price erosion seeming endless to the farmer, this is understandable.\\nThe much-anticipated logistical difficulties are not, as yet, manifesting themselves. Orders are being executed prompt- ly, giving those yet to order some comfort that their ‘just-in- time’ tactics are justified.\\nAN\\nDomestic AN is going on farm in the range £215-£220/t bagged. This suggests that a delivered to merchant price of £210-£215/t bagged is being supported by CFFUK and Yara. But farmers still expect further price drops.\\nImport AN prices have dropped significantly this week. Fresh Lithan and Pulan tonnes are being offered at €240-250/t cif bagged, reflecting £185-192/t cif bagged, or £195-202/t fca bagged. This is down about £10/t from the end of Janu- ary. Imported material was previously uncompetitive with domestic, but this price cut may help.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nN+S\\nN+S products do not currently reflect the softened AN pric- es. 27N 30SO3 and 29N 20SO3 are trading at a £5/t premium at £220-£225/t bagged delivered to farm.\\nImported ASN is offered now in the range £200-205/t fca bagged, down from offers on the same terms at about £203- 210/t at the end of January.\\nUrea\\nOffers are in range £215-£220/t bagged delivered farm, equivalent to £200-205/t fca bagged - down from offers at the end of January at £205-208/t fca bagged. Buyers focused on cost/kg N over agronomic efficiency are being tempted to switch from AN – urea is at £0.47/kg N and AN is at £0.63/ kg N.\\nRecent arrivals include Algerian product from Ameropa into Birkenhead.\\nA March offer of north African product was heard at around $255/t cif bulk, equivalent to about £200/t fca bagged.\\nPK/NPKs\\nWhilst some sales are being made, as with AN, buyers seem reluctant to commit. Moves to raise prices have been largely unsuccessful, and blended 20-10-10 remains priced around £235/t delivered to merchant. CFFUK compound is being traded at around £250/t delivered to merchant.\\nPKs also do not yet reflect the indicated price rise and 0-24- 24 remains in the range £235-240/t delivered.\\nPhosphate/Potash\\nPhosphates prices are unchanged on little trade. DAP is be- ing sold at £340/t fca bags, while TSP is priced at £265/t fca bags.\\nGranular MOP has stabilized at around £220/t fca bags.\\nItaly\\nPrices drop, demand yet to rise\\nPrices have dropped across the board domesti- cally for February, with a particularly sharp \\ndrop for granular urea as Yara adjusted its offer price for material from its Ferrara plant. Nitrates also saw price de- creases, with CAN slipping by about €5-10/t and AN a similar amount.\\nThe international situation is similar. Importers are target- ing substantial price decreases for DAP, and look likely to achieve them basis latest sales of Tunisian DAP into Turkey, though OCP is holding firm for now.\\nOther than some demand from wheat growers in central Ita- ly, little demand is reported still. There is talk of a logistics squeeze if demand comes in a short burst, but this might be better than the hand-to-mouth purchases at the moment.\\nUrea\\nUrea prices have dropped across the board, as Yara and other suppliers adjusted their prices to better reflect inter- national markets and to stimulate demand.\\nYara has lowered its prices for granular urea ex-Ferrara, now at €290/t fca big bags. Previously it was at €315/t fca big bags.\\nOther suppliers are in a broad range. Borealis is selling at €270-275/t fca big bags in Ravenna, with other suppliers reporting business at €280-290/t fca big bags.\\nThere is little apparent demand for imports at present, with many reluctant to take further positions in the falling market. Prices in Egypt have dropped again this week, with business done in a range of $215-225/t fob. This would trans- late to about $235/t cfr, equivalent to around €235-240/t fca big bags.

Mopco is the most affected exporter, offline since the explosion and expected to be down for a further two weeks. Other producers went offline temporarily, or reduced operating rates, but are now running again. EFC is running at 70pc capacity, and directing 40pc of its output to the Egyptian market.\\nThere is a freight inquiry by Trammo to load 4,000t of Egyp- tian urea ex-El Delkheila or Abu Qir during 1-3 February for shipment to Barletta.\\nCAN\\nYara is offering its CAN 26 at €255/t fca big bags, down €10/t from January. Others report offers between €245-250/t fca big bags, down by around €5/t since the end of January.\\nGood demand is reported from central Italy, where nitrogen is being applied to wheat. Borealis is selling here at €265- 270/t delivered bagged.\\nAs in other European markets there is some concern over the potential for a substantial price drop once demand starts, to realign CAN with urea. The nitrate premium to urea is particularly strong at present and may lead buyers to switch to urea. But across Europe there is a general feeling that producers will wait for existing stocks to be depleted before announcing price drops in March-April.\\nAN is on offer at about €290/t fca big bags in the north of Italy, down about €10/t since late January.\\nItaly DAP vs ARA rapeseed\\nDAP Italy €/t (LH Axis)\\nRapeseed OME RED fob ARA $/t (RH Axis)\\nOCP is indicating unwillingness to go below $435/t fob, but is only offering 20,000-30,000t to Europe in February anyway.

There are rumours of offers much below this too, which would better reflect the prices of import cargoes arriving January-February.\\nGCT January cargoes are arriving, sold largely at prices equivalent to $445-450/t cfr, or the mid-€420s/t fca big bags. But importers are now targeting $390-400/t fob for North African origin, which would equate to about $410- 420/t cfr. Indeed GCT has made sales of small lots to Turkey for February shipment netting back to about $380/t fob.\\nSpain\\nHand-to-mouth urea buying\\nAs is often the case, weather conditions are playing a major role in Spanish fertilizer\\ndemand. At present there is a regional split with insufficient rain in parts of the south, and excessive rainfall in parts of the north. In both cases, fertilizer demand is being under- mined.\\nTraditionally CAN application would be starting now in the north, but this year, fields are too wet to enter. Latest estimates suggest consumption could be another 10-15 days away. In the south, urea application is underway but yet to gather any pace because it is too warm and there is a lack of moisture in the ground.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Fertilizer Europe\\nTo add to sellers’ woes, international prices of all the lead- ing fertilizers are trending downwards. Late this week, urea showed some signs of stability. But buyers remain wary as urea has seen sharp price declines since the start of the year and it is unclear how long this stabilisation will last.\\nThe net result of these two factors – unfavourable weather and weak international pricing – is cautious, hand-to-mouth, just-in-time domestic buying. Sellers talk of minimal demand and only for small lots if at all. Stocks at the importer and distributor level are high awaiting greater movement among retailers and farmers.\\nIf the weather does improve then domestic consumption should increase. Undoubtedly, buyers will remain cautious wanting small lots for prompt delivery/laycan dates, but at least this will allow greater movement to the field and see products transferred along the domestic system. This will allow importers to step in again.\\nUrea\\nThere is some granular urea import interest but caution over falling prices and loading delays is hampering actual trade. Granular urea is offered at $252/t cif including 90 days’ credit for immediate loading and at prices below $250/t\\ncif including 90 days’ credit for laycan/arrival not fully fixed. Importers are aware that anything arriving in March may be too late for the current cereals application pe- riod, but remain cautious because of the recent urea price trend.\\nAmong recent imports, Medifer is understood to have 4,000t of Algerian urea arriving in Alicante. Trammo was checking freight for 5,000t Arzew to Valencia, loading early this week. Medifer’s 5,000t Ameropa/Arzew cargo is due to arrive in Seville imminently.\\nReports of a large prilled cargo booked for Huelva could not be confirmed.\\nIn the domestic market, Fertiberia is priced at around\\n€240-245/t fca but it is understood it will be competitive amid falling granular prices. NIC is offering granular urea at €260/t fca, but granular is also heard to be available at prices below this level.\\nCAN\\nNormally CAN application would be starting now, but exces- sive rain in the north and northwest has delayed the season. It is estimated that around 10-15 days are needed to dry the fields out. There is a lot of product in the system already and prices are under downwards pressure.\\nFertiberia’s list price of €246/t fca is obsolete with the market well below this. CAN 27 is widely available at around €245/t delivered or at equivalent levels of €225-230/t fca/ ex-warehouse.\\nUAN\\nIt is not the high season for UAN 32 application and the dry weather in the south has halted any potential usage for now. Domestic tanks are full with some buyers not taking receipt of the volumes ordered. Prices remain around, or slightly below, €200/t ex-tank/fca.\\nDAP\\nThere is minimal DAP demand in the domestic market, partly because of the time of year and also because of falling international prices. Fertiberia has withdrawn its list prices, awaiting firm demand. It has no further imports lined up for February from OCP at this stage, and is instead focused on liquidating stocks.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nThere are a wide range of price indications across Spain, but no activity to confirm accurate levels. In the south indica- tions range €420-440/t fca/ex-warehouse, with certain importers trying to keep levels towards the high end of this range based on the expensive stock being held. But in the north, DAP is available at around €435-440/t delivered basis supplies in Bayonne, France. This would reflect nearer €420/t fca. There are also indications around €400/t fas duty paid, ex-Russia.\\never-diminishing urea price.

This is down by €10-12/t since last offers at the end of January. Urea is not widely used in Belgium but it is traded through its ports.\\nDAP\\nDAP prices have continued to fall losing about €15-20/t since end January. Offers were heard at €380-385/t fca or $420- 425/t fca Benelux ports this week. Buying interest, however, was extremely low as blenders are well-stocked for the time being. New buying is not expected until April/May for the corn application season.\\nTSP prices have in contrast remained stable because of less competition in the market. Offers remain at around €355/t fca Ghent for imported TSP and at €365/t ex-works Amster- dam.\\nMOP\\nInterest in re-stocking granular MOP has begun to surface slowly. Wet field conditions may see applications delayed and this could impact buying. Prices have softened slightly as competition for sales mounts.

How- ever, buyers are well aware of the latest falls in urea, DAP and potash and this is bound to pressure NPK prices lower once re-stocking begins. Last prices of imported 15-15-15 were at €325/t fca ex-store with local product offered at €335/t cif inland.\\nThe Netherlands\\nMarket awaits season start\\nThe Dutch market continues to wait for the application season to start. Buyers remain\\nextremely cautious in the wake of the drop in both DAP and urea prices globally. Farmers are beginning to start to think about fertilizers and applications are expected to commence in about two weeks’ time. CAN producers are not thought likely to adjust prices lower until wholesalers and retailers have shifted higher-priced stock in March/April.\\nCAN\\nEveryone continues to wait in earnest for the application season to start in mid-February. Stocks are high at all points; producer, wholesale and retail. Buyers remain nervous of restocking as the market expects CAN prices to pull back in line with lower indications for urea on the global market. Producers, however, are unlikely to want to drop the CAN price until higher-priced inventories are sold on. Therefore CAN 27pc prices have remained at €226-230/t cif inland for the time being. But based on the current price of urea in Benelux ports at €225-230/t fca CAN looks severely out of line and over-priced. Producers are expected to adjust CAN prices lower when buyers step in to re-stock some time dur- ing March/April.\\nOCI’s 1.4mn t/year CAN unit at Geleen is still on track to begin restarting in week six (week commencing 8 February). All three lines have been halted since 30 September follow- ing a serious fire at the site. The restart is 4-5 weeks later than originally planned and the loss of production is estimat- ed at over 500,000t of CAN. OCI is planning for full running by the second half of March.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Fertilizer Europe\\nDAP/TSP\\nOffers of DAP have dropped dramatically again following falls in the international market.

When buyers come back into the market for re-fill volumes MOP prices are expected to be pressured down in line with falls in other commodities.\\nIreland\\nGround waterlogged, market inactive\\nThe market is not yet moving – the ground is still too wet for application in most areas. De-\\ncember and January were very wet months, and the ground needs a week to ten days without rain to dry out. Farmer demand is expected to increase once the ground has dried out, perhaps by the latter half of February. For now, retail- ers estimate farmers to have taken about half the normal amount of fertilizers; demand may come in a rush once the ground dries out.\\nIn some areas there is already good grass coverage, which has encouraged some farmers to set cattle to graze before first fertilizer application. This will push back some demand, in theory. But there is a concerted effort by retailers to explain that this may reduce grass growth potential later in the year, so this may be limited.\\nWholesaler and retailer list prices are being maintained to date, with little business to test them. There is a general worry that CAN prices might be pressured lower once de- mand starts – but retailers and importers alike hope to shift existing stocks before this happens. Some estimates have enough CAN in country already to cover through to end- April/early-May. The feeling from other European markets is\\nIssue 16-03 | Friday 5 February 2016\\nthat producers may adjust CAN prices lower during March- April.\\nImporters are largely covered for urea, having bought before Christmas.

The US market is lending strength to urea. Cfr levels in the US Gulf have firmed to $220-223/t, equivalent to $210-213/t fob Middle East given current depressed freight rates. There are few cargoes being offered to Brazilian buyers at present, and prices of these have moved up to $200-205/t cfr. Chinese suppliers look unlikely to reduce prices ahead of the New Year break, with traders having difficulty covering below $200/t fob. Short covering in the Black Sea has seen prices pushed back up to $200-201/t fob Yuzhny from the low-$190s/t fob at the start of the week. Egypt was the only origin with lower prices this week, with sales made at $215-224/t fob for February.\\nPotash\\nIndia’s Department of Fertilizers has stopped the movement of imported MOP from ports and domestic stores, amid mounting stocks and low domestic demand. Officially there has been no progress with 2016 Chinese contract talks and now this market is heading into the New Year and Spring Festival holidays. NPK plants are already shut down and no activity is expected over the coming weeks. Some price stability emerged this week in Malaysia and Indonesia, however, aided by strengthening local currencies compared to the US dollar. In Brazil, firm demand is limited and price indications have edged down again. A trade has been reported this week at a price understood to be around $240/t cfr Brazil for 24,000t of granular MOP. This vessel will load between 5-10 February.\\nDAP/MAP\\nPrices remain under pressure in all regions. In response Mosaic has cut first quarter production by 400,000t DAP/ MAP, OCP is tailoring its output to match demand and Sabic is pushing 2H February shipments back to March. But Chinese producers look unlikely to cut back further, and OCP also this week inaugurated its new 1mn t/ year DAP/MAP/NPK plant at Jorf Lasfar. Latin American prices continued to fall as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. In Argentina, MAP traded at $335/t cfr with $325/t cfr widely reported done in Brazil.

Around NKr930mn of the total relates to the Yara production plants in Montoir, France, and in Trinidad and Tobago.\\nYara Montoir will take an impairment charge of about NKr550mn. The plant is one of Yara\\'s smallest fertilizer facilities, with production capacity of around 300,000 t/yr of nitrates and 300,000 t/yr of NPKs. The plant has limited export opportunities and is exposed to lower profitability in its domestic market, given lower grain prices and lower phosphate and potash demand.\\nThe impairment charge for Yara Trinidad is about NKr380mn. The Trinidad and Tobago plant is one of Yara\\'s smallest am- monia plants, with production capacity of around 270,000 t/ yr. The plant suffers from frequent gas supply curtailments and has lower energy efficiency than Yara\\'s average levels.\\nYara\\'s fourth-quarter results will also be affected by lower sales and production compared with the year-earlier period, mainly for ammonia and urea following significant production shut- downs at plants producing those products during the quarter. Deliveries of Yara\\'s produced ammonia and urea each fell by about 160,000t compared with the fourth quarter last year, while sales of the company\\'s produced nitrates were down by around 100,000t over the same period.

Complex fertilizer output fell by just under 2pc to 2.49mn t from 2.53mn t, while NPK output of 2.43mn t was stable compared with a year earlier, falling by less than 1pc.\\nLicensed to: Kenza Iraqi, OCP GROUP\\nAGRICULTURE REVIEW\\nEU maize production to fall in 2015-16\\nThe EU’s latest cereals forecast report estimates that maize production in 2015-16 will fall by 28pc to 56.2mn t, com- pared with 2014-15. This figure was projected at 56.6mn t in December.\\nProduction of rye and oats is also expected to fall during the period — by 15pc and 7pc to 7.4mn t and 7.5mn t, respectively.\\nOverall cereal production is to fall by 7pc year on year to 307mn t in 2015-16.\\nThe report reveals that production of soft wheat and maize was at a record level in 2014-15, at 149mn t and 78mn t, re- spectively. Wheat production is forecast at 150mn t in 2015-16.\\nThe report also forecast that end stocks as at June 2016 would stand at around 43mn t for all cereals, down from the 46.1mn t carried forward from June 2015.\\nMild weather delays crop hardening in Europe\\nExtremely mild weather in December has delayed the hard- ening of winter crops within Europe, the EU’s January MARS crop monitoring report says.\\n“Our latest frost-kill model simulations show no or only a slight degree of hardening in western and southern Europe,” the report says. Winter crops have not gained low-tempera- ture tolerance owing to unusually high temperatures in most of the British Isles, the Iberian peninsula and France, the\\nMediterranean region, the Balkan peninsula and surrounding areas of the Black Sea.\\nThese crops run the risk of incurring frost-kill damage in the event of a sudden freezing air intrusion, according to the EU’s Joint Research Commission.\\nThe situation has improved slightly in central and southeast- ern Europe since mid-December, owing to the colder-than- usual weather conditions of late December-early January.\\nSyngenta favours ChemChina takeover bid\\nSwitzerland-based agricultural company Syngenta is poised to accept a $43bn cash takeover offer from Chinese state- owned ChemChina.\\nSyngenta\\'s board of directors unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the offer.

Prices of oil, contract gas, corn, DAP and urea are all falling as a response to deflationary energy markets and weak fertilizer demand growth and oversupply.\\n•A tighter ammonia market in 2015 is expected to provide shelter from the full force of collapsing fundamentals as production curtailments are expected to persist in Egypt, Ukraine and Trinidad. However, new merchant ammonia capacity coming on stream over forecast will add liquidity to the market and allow a closer alignment between ammonia and nitrogen values set by urea.\\n•Since the previous edition of this report we have added Yara/BASF 750,000t/y standalone, merchant ammonia plant to the forecast in 2019.\\n•Ammonia demand is expected to remain strong over the next five years, driven predominately by gains in urea, ammonium nitrate (including TAN) and DAP from 2017. However, a weak outlook for grain prices could limit growth.\\nA bear market ahead as ammonia loses fight with gravity\\n3.5\\n3.0DAP\\n2.5Urea\\n1.5Corn\\n1.0Oil\\n0.0 -0.5 -1.0 -1.5 -2.0\\nData: CRU, IMF, EIA\\n•However, CRU does not expect the ammonia market to be as exposed to deflationary energy markets as the urea market.\\n•The global supply/demand balance continues to look healthy and is not forecast to fall below 80% over our forecast period. An operating rate at this level should allow producers at the market’s margins to remain profitable.\\n•Ammonia also has a different cost profile to the urea market, and short-run marginal costs will be set by export orientated producers in Ukraine and Eastern on oil-linked gas contracts.\\n3.30\\n3.10\\n2.90\\n2.70\\n2.50\\n2.30\\n2.10\\n1.90\\n1.70\\n1.50 \\nData: CRU, USDA, CME\\n•All of the major fundamentals we track as indicators of ammonia price trend have undergone a substantial devaluation over the last six months, which will weigh heavily on ammonia values.\\n•This has forced us to reappraise our cyclical price forecasts and implement a significant downwards revision in 2015 and 2016.\\n•However, our view of the market for 2018 and 2019 remains little changed. And as can be seen in the chart opposite we are forecasting a substantial rebound in pricing fundamentals by 2017.\\nData: CRU, IFA\\n• Brazil and Argentina are both in the midst of a record soyabean harvest and futures quotations have fallen sharply since December. This reflects a forecast 40% rise on global inventory levels. Meanwhile, corn futures prices have remained steady since finding a floor in September, with lower prices seemingly triggering extra demand.\\n• As soyabean prices move lower, and corn holds its ground, the soybean:corn price ratio has moved considerably, with the Soy Nov15 contract:Corn Dec 15 contract currently at 2.3:1, compared to 2.4:1 at the beginning of the year. With the spring planting period approaching, this should help to boost corn 2015 plantings and nitrogen demand.\\nAgricultural demand is forecast to support operating rates...\\nGlobal ammonia demand is forecast to reach 176.9 million tonnes in 2015, up from the 173.1 million estimated for 2014. With global grain and oilseed prices reaching a period of consolidation following consecutive ample grain and oilseed harvest, fertilizer demand over the coming years is likely to be pressured. This will particularly be the case for cost-conscious agricultural producers such as the United States.\\nThere has been much industry conjecture in the USA over 2015 crop areas as we approach the spring planting season. Lower corn prices seen throughout 2014 are thought to have favoured soyabeans over corn for planned planting. CRU sees corn harvested area falling 1.9%, to 33.0 million hectares, with soyabean area expected to be 33.7 million hectares, similar to 2014. Lower corn area will pressure demand for ammonia, particularly direct application ammonia, a common source of nitrogen in the Midwestern states.\\nSince the beginning of 2015 the soyabean:corn price ratio has declined to levels supporting corn planting. While the ratio was supportive for more soyabean plantings in the key November-December 2014 period (when crop choice decisions are made), the steep declines in soyabean prices in 2015 has seen the ratio slip below a possible ‘crop switch point’. This may spur some extra corn plantings and ammonia demand, particularly in the Midwest where an early start to fieldwork is expected due to recent warm and dry conditions. It must be noted that the area available to crop switching in the Midwest is limited to around 3% of total arable area.\\nPhosphate fertilizers are the most sensitive to low agricultural prices and are often the first to be cut when farmers look to reduce input costs. If crop prices continue to move lower over 2015 and 2016 but fertilizer prices remain steady, both demand and production of ammoniated phosphates may be throttled. The lag period of such throttling must be considered. Declines in demand will cause a build up of inventories, which will later trigger cuts in production and therefore ammonia demand.\\n...and the floor price will support prices in 2015 as oil lags gas prices\\nProducers in Ukraine, as well as other major producing regions in Central and East European, rely on supplies of imported Russian gas as the feedstock for their ammonia production process. These gas supplies are sold on long-term take-or-pay contracts, indexed to the price of Brent crude oil on what are termed Groningen-type contracts. These contracts are based on replacement value theory: in the past oil was consumed in Europe for power-generation and heating purposes and was substitutable for gas. As Russian gas had/has very low production costs, it was priced on an oil basis to account for its substitutability for oil in the European energy consumption mix.\\nIn the table we have used our calculated oil-indexed gas price for Ukraine (nine-month lag to our forecast of Brent crude) and modelled the weighted-average cost of ammonia exports at Yuzhnyy port. The costs are taken from CRU’s Nitrogen Fertilizer Cost Report and are on an annualised basis. This means it is an average breakeven price for the year and a producer may well, for a period, sell at a price lower than its annual breakeven price in the expectation that prices may recover in the future. There are also costs such as maintenance and payroll taxes that do not require in-year payment and may be postponed.\\nUkraine: Export Costs, 2014-19 ($/t)\\nA new wave of Russian nitrogen investment is quietly growing...\\nIn July 2013, Eurochem announced its intention to build a world scale ammonia and urea plant in Louisiana, citing a wish to establish production closer to its sizable US customer base, and capitalize on readily available energy, labour, infrastructure and logistics. However, global geopolitics has changed since then: both oil and the Russian rouble have lost almost half their value and sanctions have been placed on Russia over its involvement in Ukraine.\\nThis has made Russian foreign investment less attractive for two reasons. Firstly, domestic production is cheaper for companies with international sales. This has certainly been the case for Eurochem which posted an EBITDA margin in Q4 2014 of 37%. The company estimates that with a USD/RUB close to 65 (as opposed to the 2013 average of 30), total operating cost savings in 2015 will be close to $500 million. Secondly, access to international capital markets has become more difficult. While Eurochem is technically now a Swiss company, the majority of its production assets (and large parts of its business) are based in Russia, and it will therefore be equally expensive for the company to service internationally (dollar) denominated interest on debt. Adding to these two factors are less favourable fundamentals in the USA where escalating capital costs and rapidly expanding capacity additions have been weakening the rational for further investment.\\nAs the result of these factors we expect to see Russian nitrogen producers predominantly focus their investment efforts at home over the next few years, and not in other countries. At present there are four greenfield projects and one brownfield included in our committed forecast, with four more under consideration.\\nNew Russian Capacity\\nICT Group – Baltic Urea plant (2018)\\nAmmonia capacity: 0.4 million t/y\\nEurochem Kingsiepp (2015)\\nammonia capacity: 0.9 million t/y\\nAcron Novgorod II (2015)\\nammonia capacity: 0.7 million t/y\\nShchekinoazot (2017)\\nammonia capacity: 0.1 million t/y\\nAmmonii Mendeleevsk (2016)\\nammonia capacity: 0.7 million t/y\\nEuroChem -Nevinnomyssk II (2018)\\nammonia capacity: 0.9 million t/y\\nSocar Sumgait (2017)\\nammonia capacity: 0.7 million t/y\\nShchekinoazot(2017)\\nammonia capacity: 0.7 million t/y\\nMinudobrenia Rossosh (n/a)\\nAmmonia capacity: 0.3 million t/y\\nRostec/Global steel holdings– Sakhna (n/a) Ammonia capacity: 2 million t/y\\nJSC National Chemical Group – Nahodka (n/a) Ammonia capacity: n/a\\n...While Yara and BASF commit to Freeport ammonia plant\\nThe rush to build nitrogen fertilizer plants in the USA has added more than 5 million t/y of ammonia since 2009 but rapid escalation of construction costs has dampened activity in the last couple of years. In the chart below we have estimated how the rate of return on a 750,000 t/y ammonia plant in the US Gulf Coast depends on the initial capex and the price premium of its feedstock over Henry Hub. A plant like Dyno Nobel’s Waggaman, which cost $850 million to build and will buy its gas from Henry Hub, yields a 12.2% annual return – 2.4% higher than if it started being built today at a cost of $1 billion. Because of this, companies are seeking ways to reduce capital costs, even if it means paying a premium for their raw materials.\\nCapex ($m)\\nThe latest innovative solution comes from Yara and BASF, which are building a 750,000t/y ammonia plant at BASF’s site in Freeport, Texas. Praxair has agreed a long-term contract to supply hydrogen, nitrogen and CO2 from its Texas City complex to be used as raw materials, saving an estimated $400 million by removing the requirement for a costly steam/methane reformer to produce hydrogen. We estimate an NPV of just $54 million for a conventional ammonia plant but $479 million if it were to cost $600 million instead of $1 billion. So in principle, Yara/BASF ought to accept to pay a premium over Henry Hub natural gas prices for its raw materials providing the NPV of the project remains above $54m. Given our stated assumptions, we believe that Yara/BASF could pay up to 49% more for its raw materials and still create a higher NPV than by building a standalone gas-based ammonia plant.\\nIn practice, Yara/BASF will expect to negotiate a premium well below this maximum. However, Praxair is investing more than $400 million to add hydrogen and nitrogen capacity and extend its Gulf Coast pipeline network to Freeport. Notwithstanding the strategic benefits of connecting to the industrial zone in Freeport, Praxair will no doubt expect Yara/BASF to contribute to a return on this capital investment as well as covering its own costs of production. Furthermore, Praxair will recognize that Yara/BASF will be making a large capital saving that is wholly contingent on its arrangement with Praxair and hence expect a share of this saving through the pricing of its raw material supply contract. So although the bargaining zone for the two parties extends all the way from Praxair’s cost of production to a 49% premium over the cost of purchasing the equivalent quantities of natural gas from Henry Hub, we expect that the supply contract will be settled at a premium of perhaps 15-30%.\\nCRU has revised down Ammonia benchmarks in 2015 and 2016\\nWe have downgraded our near-term ammonia forecast by around $75/t in response to a rapidly weakening outlook for ammonia market fundamentals. The urea price has collapsed at Black Sea and Middle Eastern FOB benchmarks as Chinese coal-based exports continue to oversupply the Pacific and Indian basins, while improved Ukrainian and North African output have increased availability East of Suez. Urea prices are not forecast to improve until 2017, in line with a recovery in global energy markets.\\nAlthough not as severe as in the urea market, oversupply is also weighing on DAP prices and reducing the operating rates at ammoniated phosphate plants. However, production is forecast to grow over the forecast period and will help maintain ammonia operating rates above 80% as urea rates decline. The corn market looks to have bottomed out and small gains are expected over the forecast. So while corn and DAP markets should support ammonia buying, the deflationary pressure from urea and energy markets will almost certainly outweigh any gains until they begin their recovery.\\nFOB Black Sea Ammonia Forecast ($/t, nominal)\\n550\\n500\\n450\\n400\\n350\\nData: CRU\\nAnnual price forecast, $/tonne, nominal\\nConditions of Sale\\nThis report has been supplied under a contract signed by an executive of your company which commits your company to hold the report confidential and to refrain from providing it or communicating its contents in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of CRU International Ltd.

CRU forecast this to increase to 176.9 million tonnes in 2015 and expand to 193.1 million tonnes by 2019. Urea production was responsible for 54% of total consumption in 2014 and is expected to remain the main component of demand over the medium term.\\nTable 1.1: Regional total ammonia demand\\nDiagram 1.1: Global ammonia demand components\\n\\n\\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\\nAmmonia requirement (million product tonnes )\\nOther ammonia consumption includes NPKs, direct application and other nitrogenous fertilizers\\nData: CRU\\nChina is the dominant consumer of ammonia, responsible for 36% of total demand in 2014. This rate was higher than usual, reflecting a sharp increase in urea production in response to unprecedented export demand. Consumption of ammonia for technical uses is seen rising sharply in the medium term, offsetting projected declines in urea production. The United States remain the second highest user, followed by India, Russia and Indonesia. Growth in consumption over the medium term will be concentrated in Africa, Middle East, South-East Asia and South America. The Middle East and Africa will be driven by expansions in nitrogen facilities, with countries looking to monetise ample gas availabilities. Increased production of Caprolactam in China will support consumption in East Asia.\\nTable 1.2: Demand by end use for major consumers (million tonnes)\\nTable 1.2: Demand by end use for major consumers (million tonnes)\\n– Concluded.\\n1.2 Agricultural Markets overview\\nAgricultural markets are important for ammonia demand despite ammonia not being directly applied to crops (except the United States). It is a key ingredient in nitrogen, phosphate and compound fertilizers. Consumption of these fertilizers is related to agricultural production and prices. The following section of this chapter outlines key market developments.\\n1.2.1 Recent agricultural developments\\nWorld grain production (wheat, corn, rice and other coarse grains) is estimated to have reached a record\\n2.5billion tonnes in 2014/15 (July/June), fractionally higher than the 2013/14 season. Global wheat output is seen at 725.0 million tonnes, up 1% compared to 2013 and a fresh high, with harvested area elevated 0.3% y-o-y. Outstanding yields were recorded in many countries, particularly within the EU and CIS. Output was lower in North America, with Canada returning to normal yields and a lower area following a near perfect 2013, while drought in the Southern Plains hampered winter wheat productivity in United States. A dry spring in south-eastern Australia forced a downgrade in production estimates, following an excellent start to the growing season. Output in Argentina grew 19% on good growing conditions and increased planted area.\\n2014/15 corn production is estimated at 991.3 million tonnes, a new record and up slightly from last year’s crop, despite a 1.6% decline in global harvested area. Record yields were reported in the United States and the EU, however, dry conditions in China’s northern growing area reduced output there. In Brazil, harvest of the first crop is progressing at a slower-than-average pace due planting delays caused by dryness. Safrinha (second) crop planting is now close to completion, with area forecast to be lower compared to last year (see section 1.3). Good rainfall and growing conditions in Argentina has been positive for crop prospects, with harvest in its early stages.\\nSoyabean output is set to reach a record 315.1 million tonnes in 2014/15, an 11% increase from the previous year, with United States production exceeding 100 million tonnes for the first time. Harvesting is underway in Brazil, with record production of 92 million tonnes expected, while favourable growing conditions in Argentina should see output expand to 57 million tonnes. Global harvested area is forecast to grow 4.2% y-o-y to 117.1 million hectares, underpinned by a 9.4% y-o-y increase in the United States.\\nRice production is estimated to remain mostly unchanged from 2013. Minor gains in China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam were not enough to offset a reduction in India’s output, reflecting a smaller summer (kharif) crop after delayed monsoon rains. Total output was seen at 475.5 million tonnes, down a modest 0.3% y-o-y, with harvested area increasing marginally to 162.4 million hectares.\\nSugar output in 2014/15 is set for its second straight decline, falling 2% from the previous season to\\n172.5million tonnes. Brazil, the largest producer, is set to experience a 5% y-o-y reduction, to 35.8 million tonnes due to drought and continued low prices. Lower production in China, Thailand, Pakistan and Russia is seen offsetting gains in India, the EU and the USA. Global sugar inventories are considered to be in a ‘glut’, with prices at five year lows.\\nConsecutive years of strong grain and oilseed production have bolstered stocks to more comfortable levels, following tightness through 2012/13 which resulted in higher prices. These higher prices triggered increased planting and this, combined with favourable weather conditions, has resulted in significantly higher output and inventory levels.\\nDiagram 1.2: Global grain and oilseed stocks:use ratio and price indices\\nData: CRU, USDA, IGC\\nPrice index (Jan 2006 = 100)\\nHigh prices triggered extra plantings. Good\\n400growing conditions has seen production rise and inventories grow, pressuring the indices\\n350lower.\\n150\\n100\\n50\\n0\\nWith high levels of stocks, grain and oilseed quotations have fallen to their lowest since 2010. Although wheat prices found some support towards the end of 2014, they have slid significantly lower in 2015. Corn prices have remained steady over the past six months, but sharply down from levels seen over the past three years. We believe that prices have now found their floor which has triggered extra demand from end users, particularly within the livestock industry. Soyabean prices have seen a steady decline as Brazil output moves towards a fresh record and global stockpiles rise almost 40% year-on-year. Rice quotations also remain under pressure, despite a drop in stocks which have been steadily building over the past ten years. Abundant global supplies of grains and oilseeds should cap any major upward price movements in the near future, particularly in H1 of 2015.\\nFertilizer prices have also seen steady declines since 2014, with strong export competition pressuring values. This has helped to ease the pressure on farmers as they face lower grain prices. While there were no significant fertilizer application cuts in 2014, CRU expect some light reductions in 2015, with phosphate fertilizers particularly sensitive the low crop prices. This could have a longer term impact on the ammonia demand for the production of DAP and MAP.\\n1.2.2 Short and medium term considerations\\nAs the northern hemisphere comes out of winter and crops (mostly winter wheat) break their dormancy, a better judgement of crop prospects can be made. Crops in good condition are expected to consume more nitrogen, as they will have a greater yield potential, whereas crops in a poor condition are expected to see reductions in application rates. The table and diagram below give a brief assessment of winter wheat crop conditions in key growing areas, along with forecast harvested areas. In key urea consuming countries, conditions are generally considered as good, supporting demand for 2015.\\nTable 1.3: Global wheat crop conditions\\nDiagram 1.3: Wheat conditions & forecast harvest area (% y-y change)\\n\\n18.5 (-2%)\\nEurope \\n6.2 (-2%) 23.4 (-1%)\\n13.5 (+6%)\\n23.8 (-1%)\\nData: CRU, IGC, FAO, USDA\\nAs the northern hemisphere spring planting season approaches, the market can clearly focus on crop areas and prices and the respective impacts on fertilizer demand. Crop prices suffered significant losses in 2014, and have continued to move lower at the beginning of 2015. While this is not supportive for agricultural production, values still sit above long term levels. The diagram below shows current market sentiment. Traders have moved toward a net short position across the major agricultural commodities, suggesting further price falls in the near term. The table overleaf collates the current developments in key markets and our view on price directions for 2015.\\nDiagram 1.4: Net futures trading positions on US agricultural markets\\nData: CRU, CFTC\\nmore traders expecting futures price to increase\\nmore traders expecting futures price to decrease\\nAmmonia Market Outlookhttp://mycru.crugroup.com\\nTable 1.4: Crop Prices and Potential Direction\\nMixed expectations of a new deficit phase.\\n1)2014 Estimates for 27 major consuming countries. a) Based on CRU trade weighted export prices. b) Kuala Lumpur palm oil futures nearby contract. c) Sugar NYBOT futures nearby contract.\\nLower crop prices are expected to impact planted area as farmers look save money on inputs where possible. Wheat harvested area is forecast to decline in the major producing countries. It should be noted that the EU-28 are the largest collective grower and exporter of wheat, with area there expected to grow 1% in 2015. Total wheat area in the Top 27 fertilizer consuming countries is seen falling for the first time since 2012. Corn area is seen moving lower in the US where growers are particularly price sensitive. Brazil area is also forecast lower due to a fall in safrinha plantings.\\nDespite high stocks and low prices, soyabean area is forecast to continue growing. Area in the US is tentatively projected to remain at 2014 levels, while Brazil plantings should continue to expand. Rice area is forecast fractionally higher, underpinned by improved plantings in India following last year’s monsoon\\ndelays. Elsewhere, rice area is expected remain on trend, seen lower in China and slightly higher in other major Asian producers. These lower planted areas are expected to pressure total fertilizer demand. Although CRU expects a slight rebound in corn and wheat values in H2 of 2015, the consensus among other global forecasting agencies is for all prices to continue their downward trend. Longer term outlooks show that wheat and rice prices are expected to remain steady, while soyabean and corn values are projected to move higher, reflecting increased animal feed demand. Higher corn prices and stable wheat and rice levels will be supportive for fertilizer demand over the longer term. The recovery in soyabean prices later in the medium term will pressure nitrogen fertilizer demand, as soyabeans compete for land area with heavy nitrogen consuming crops like corn and spring wheat. However this will support phosphate demand.\\nDiagram 1.5: 2015 forecast harvested areas, top 5 growing countries\\nData: CRU\\nThe outlook for lower prices in the near term will pressure fertilizer demand, however this will be somewhat offset by softer fertilizer prices. Demand for both nitrogen and phosphate based fertilizers is expected to grow in 2015, underpinned by consumption in Asia. More developed markets, like North America and Europe may be pressured by lower crop prices, while growth in Brazil is set to continue, but at a lower rate than seen in previous years. Increased agricultural production and demand over the medium term will support fertilizer demand to 2019.\\nNutrient Forecasting Methodology\\nCRU has developed a nutrient demand model, forecasting consumption at a country level over the next five years. Agricultural production is a function of food demand; therefore the first stage is to forecast global food demand, which is a function of population and GDP growth. Population growth determines total caloric requirements, while rising income affects food consumption (i.e. which food group will make up those calories).\\nThe second and third stages are to forecast crop area and application rates by country. On a global basis, twenty seven countries (major consumers) account for approximately 90% of nutrient demand. By comparison, the remaining one hundred and fifty countries in our model (minor consumers), account for just 10% of global nutrient consumption. As such we have used two different approaches to calculate crop area and application rates in these two groups.\\nConcept of nutrient demand model\\nGrowth in harvested area by crop in major consuming countries is based on our food demand projections. This is calculated using an historical series from the FAO, recent and current data from various sources, and forecasts from the CRU crop model. The forecast is then disaggregated by country and by crop, factoring in population, food intake, and average yields. All of these elements enable us to produce a robust forecast of production growth rates on a country and crop level, and thus a forecast of crop area calculated by country and by crop.\\nTo calculate nutrient application rates by crop, we estimate the base year using IFA/FAO and FAPRI data or national sources. This is back-casted for all crops using country-level application rates, unless national sources are available, such as USDA data. The forecast is then based on recent trends and analyst judgement, and manual adjustments at country-level are made to reflect current apparent nutrient demand for N, P2O5 and K2O. A much simpler approach is used when calculating crop area and\\napplication rates in minor consuming countries. In this case, we extrapolate recent trends to aggregate crop area by country and application rate by country. Thus, nutrient demand is calculated as a function of these.\\nCrop area forecast in major consuming countries\\n1.3 NH3 Demand from Ammoniated Phosphates\\nThe most important developments in ammoniated phosphates supply through 2014 occurred in Africa, where widespread social unrest resulted in the curtailment of both phosphoric acid and concentrated phosphate fertilizer. This was most notable in Tunisia, where relentless strike action within GCT’s mining division (CPG) and logistics provider (Tunisian Company for the Transport of Mining Products in Gafsa), severely reduced rock supply. Phosphoric acid production and concentrated phosphate fertilizer production in Tunisia through 2014 fell to an estimated 731,000 tonnes P2O5 and 511,000 tonnes P2O5 respectively; a 21% and 29% reduction when compared to 2013. This resulted in a 40% decline in ammonia demand for DAP and MAP production, to 107,000 tonnes.\\nAdditionally, North America saw reductions in production in 2014. In Q4, MissPhos idled phosphoric acid and DAP production, shortly after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with no clear intention of resuming operations. Also in Q4, Mosaic curtailed production in a successful attempt to pressure their suppliers of ammonia to reduce prices. Total United States demand for ammonia in MAP and DAP production fell 6% year-on-year, to 1.9 million tonnes.\\nDespite the production troubles outlined above and the fact that global capacity for concentrated phosphate fertilizer fell by 2% year-on-year, production increased by 3% to 31.1 million tonnes P2O5.\\nThis increase in production was attributed to greater production in Asia, resulting from the successful commissioning of new plants there.\\nGlobal production of MAP increased to 12.1 million tonnes in 2014, up 1.8% from 2013 volumes. Production in CIS, North America and Africa declined but was outweighed by sharp gains in China. 2015 output is forecast to increase slightly, to 12.2 million tonnes, with demand for ammonia seen at 3.8 million tonnes. This modest growth rate is projected to continue over the medium term, with 2019 volumes seen at 12.4 million tonnes of MAP, with an ammonia requirement of 3.8 million tonnes.\\nDAP production experienced a sharper level of growth in 2014, moving 4.2% higher from 2013 volumes to 16.4 million tonnes P2O5. Output in China again underpinned growth, increasing 9.2% to 7.9 million tonnes. Volumes from Africa also increased but at a comparatively modest level, while the United States suffered steady losses. 2015 levels of DAP are forecast to remain steady, at 16.6 million tonnes, with an ammonia requirement of 8.3 million tonnes. This should accelerate over the medium term, to 18.6 million tonnes DAP by 2019 with an ammonia demand of 9.3 million tonnes.\\nOther regional developments expected to drive ammonia demand from ammoniated phosphate markets include:\\n•Downstream phosphate production capacity in Morocco is expected to increase significantly over the forecast period, with MAP capacity increasing from 2.1 million tonnes in 2014 to 3.5 million tonnes in 2019. DAP capacity will also increase over the outlook period, reaching 4.3 million tonnes by 2019, adding 1.3 million tonnes in 5 years. This translates into a total ammonia requirement of 1.1 million tonnes in 2019, a steep increase from the 0.8 million tonnes required for 2014. The shortfall in ammonia will be supplied by PotashCorp from Trinidad & Tobago. For this purpose, new ammonia storage capacity will be build at Jorf Lasfar, allowing enough storage of ammonia to sustain 45 days of ammoniated phosphate production at capacity.\\n•In Saudi Arabia, Ma’aden is expected to continue the expansion of current phosphate fertilizer capacity over the forecast period. MAP capacity will increase from current 0.5 million tonnes to\\n0.8million tonnes in 2019. In terms of DAP, capacity will increase sharply, from 3.3 million tonnes in 2014 to 5.8 million in 2019. This will translate into a doubling of the current ammonia requirement, to 1.2 million tonnes in 2019.\\n•Output in Brazil is also forecast to rise, with MAP capacity rising from 1.3 million tonnes in 2014, to 2.1 million in 2019, underpinned by strong domestic fertilizer demand as the agricultural industry continues its rapid growth. This will lead to an ammonium requirement of\\n0.3million tonnes by 2019, up from the current level of 0.2 million.\\n•The outlook for the ammonia demand from the phosphate sector in the United States is that of a decrease as US producers reduce MAP and DAP production in favour of NP+S over the forecast period, although capacity utilisation is expected to increase significantly following recent consolidations. Ammonia requirements will be reduced by more than 0.1 million tonnes, to 1.8 million tonnes by 2019. Ammonia is primarily imported from Trinidad & Tobago and the US state of Louisiana.\\nDiagram 1.7: Ammoniated phosphates production forecast\\nProduction (million tonnes P2O5)\\nMAP\\n12\\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\\nData: CRU\\nPhosphate fertilizers are the most sensitive to low agricultural prices and are often the first to be cut when farmers look to reduce input costs. If crop prices continue to move lower over 2015 and 2016 but fertilizer prices remain steady, both demand and production of ammoniated phosphates may be throttled. However, the lag period of such throttling must be considered. Declines in demand will cause a build up of inventories, which will later trigger cuts in production and therefore ammonia demand. Global ammonia demand from MAP and DAP production in 2014 is estimated at 12.0 million tonnes. This is tentatively forecast to rise to 12.1 million tonnes in 2015 and expand to 13.1 million tonnes over the medium term. This will mainly be driven by expansions in DAP capacity, which is the phosphate fertilizer which is expected to grow the most and has the highest nitrogen content.\\nTable 1.5: Ammonia required in DAP and MAP (‘000 tonnes)\\n1.4 Anhydrous Ammonia (direct application) demand\\nThe direct application of ammonia (anhydrous ammonia) in the US is a major source of crop nitrogen, with approximately 3.3 million tonnes (N based) applied each year. Its high concentration (82% N) means it is often the cheapest form of nitrogen available, although it must be stored under high pressure, requires specialised/expensive infrastructure and can only be applied when weather and soil conditions suit. Almost all global consumption of anhydrous ammonia occurs in the US.\\nThe winter conditions have again been severely cold; however this is not thought to have had any major impact on crop or field conditions. Indeed, hard soil caused by freezing conditions in January allowed farmers in some states to progress with fertilizer applications prior to spring sowing. Conditions throughout February and March have not been advantageous for fieldwork, but snowfall on the corn-belt should boost soil moisture reserves. Current conditions in the Midwest have been warm and dry which may allow for an early start to fieldwork, encouraging additional ammonia demand.\\nHarvested areas for the major crops are likely to be lower in 2015, with plantings in marginal growing areas to be cut due to the lower crop price outlook. Wheat area is seen at 18.5 million hectares (18.8 million last year), with both winter and spring wheat areas expected to be lower. Spring wheat plantings will be pressured by low corn prices, as spring wheat is often used as a feed replacement for corn. The strong US dollar has reduced export demand for US wheat and is further expected to pressure prices. Corn harvested area is seen at 33.0 million hectares (33.6 million last year). Plantings in marginal areas are forecast lower; however with soyabean prices falling at a faster rate than corn, area may rise from initial expectations.\\nAs farmers approach the spring planting season, traders and distributors obtain a better understanding of the nitrogen fertilizer mix for the year. Reports suggest a ‘normal’ nitrogen product split year (Urea, Direct application ammonia, UAN (nitrogen solutions)). The diagram below shows the average split in popular nitrogen products in key consumption states from 2010-2012. On average, 3.3 million tonnes of nitrogen are consumed through direct application ammonia. Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Kansas are the largest users.\\nDiagram 1.8: Average nitrogen fertilizer use in the United States\\nNitrogen fertilizer use (\\'000 tonnes N)\\nData: CRU, AAPFCO\\nWith corn area forecast lower in 2015 and wheat plantings also set to decline; direct application ammonia demand is seen falling to 4.1 million product tonnes in 2015. Over the medium term, consumption is seen declining at a gradual pace, moving to 3.4 million tonnes, pressured by alternative and cheaper products such as UAN. Furthermore, aging equipment is not expected to be replaced, while expansions in plantings are expected to occur in regions where anhydrous ammonia facilities are not available.\\n1.5 Technical ammonia demand\\n1.5.1 NH3 demand from the caprolactam industry\\nIn recent years, the caprolactam (CPL) industry has seen a sustained period of capacity growth. Much of this growth has been driven by increased demand for nylon-6 fibre which is the primary consumer of caprolactam.\\nThe caprolactam industry is divided between facilities integrated with ammonia production and those that are not integrated, requiring merchant supply from domestic and international buyers. In countries where energy is mostly imported, such Japan or South Korea, caprolactam plants are likely to buy merchant ammonia. On the other hand, countries such as Russia and Uzbekistan mostly have integrated ammonia facilities with their caprolactam plants. Historically, the split between integrated and non-integrated facilities has been close to 50:50 and the split is expected to remain over the forecast period despite all new capacity additions expected to occur in China by 2019.\\nDiagram 1.9: Regional caprolactam capacity, 2014 (‘000 t)\\nTotal production capacity stood at 6.5 million tonnes in 2014, though with the market in oversupply, actual production was lower with global operating rates in the 75 - 80% range. Capacity is expected to continue growing significantly over the forecast, though growth is likely to tail off towards the end of the market as the market becomes increasingly saturated.\\nThe effects of increased capacity in China are also likely to affect countries actively involved in the trade of caprolactam. Increasing levels of domestic production are forecast to displace caprolactam imports into China leading to an annual import decline of 12% over the forecast period. Predictably, increased capacity in China will drive domestic demand for ammonia. By 2019, China is expected to consume 1.0 million tonnes of merchant ammonia for caprolactam production.\\n1.5.2 Acrylonitrile\\nAs with the caprolactam industry, the building of acrylonitrile plants has grown to satisfy global demand for synthetic fibres and resins. Acrylonitrile is used in the production of acrylic and modacrylic fibres which account for 50% of its global use. Other uses for acrylonitrile and its polymeric derivatives include automotive components and computer appliances. Specialty plastic composites included polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibres for lightweight applications in aircraft, motor vehicles and engineering applications. Other large consumers of acrylonitrile are the acrylonitrile (polymer), styrene and styrene acrylonitrile polymer industries. These industries account for more than 30% of the acrylonitrile used globally. They are used mainly in the production of chemical resistant industrial hoses, gaskets and seals. Global ammonia demand from the acrylonitrile industry is forecast to remain relatively constant for the majority of the forecast period. By 2019 ammonia demand is expected to reach 2.3 million t/y.\\n1.5.3 Methyl Methacrylate\\nMethyl methacrylate or MMA is expected to use approximately 158,000 tonnes of merchant ammonia globally in its manufacturing process in 2014. It is important to note that nitrogen is not consumed in the final product and the merchant ammonia is only used as an intermediary chemical to neutralize the acid conditions that the reaction favours. Ammonium sulphate is produced as a co-product from this reaction.\\nMMA is used mostly for the formation of acrylic plastics and a small number of specialist applications. In 2019, it is estimated that a 152,300 tonnes of ammonia will be required globally for the production of MMA, or a decrease of 3.8% since 2014 in line with growth of industrial production in developed countries.\\n1.6 Other Ammonia Consumers\\nApproximately 283,000 tonnes of ammonia are consumed globally by other minor industries in 2014. CRU has collected these processes together base on the fact that growth from these industries is not large or absolute consumption is relatively small. Included in this category is uranium processing (limited to Canada), emissions scrubbing, Nickel High Pressure Acid Leaching (Ni-PAL) and the ammonium carbonate-gypsum process. Ammonia demand in this category has a very small growth rate because many processes have been superseded by new technologies not requiring ammonia or the process has a niche that exists in a sector not showing large growth.\\nAmmonia demand from the above industries is forecast to increase to 308,000 t/y by 2019. Most of this new demand is to be driven by the nickel industry that is forecast to add more than 500,000 tonnes of new nickel to the current 1.6 million tonnes already produced. Almost 17% of nickel production is achieved through the Ni-PAL (requiring ammonia) process.\\nChapter 2 - Supply\\n2.1 Outlook for Ammonia Supply\\nGlobal capacity of ammonia is expected to equal 236.4 million tonnes in 2019. This is a 0.2 million tonnes upwards revision from our previous forecast and reflects the addition of two new plants to the forecast which slightly outweighs lower than previously expected capacity growth in China. Other key supply side developments in this outlook include:\\n•We now have 64 projects in our committed forecast. In addition to these projects we are currently tracking 82 speculative plants with a total of 51.7 million tonnes of ammonia capacity. Out of these plants, 21 are located in East Asia, 19 in North America, 11 in South Asia, 7 in Sub- Saharan Africa with the rest spread between CIS, South America and Oceania.\\n•Since the previous outlook global production has been lowered to reflect a more bearish demand outlook in key ammonia consuming markets. We have lowered our forecasted ammonia demand in urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammoniated phosphate production. As a result global operating rates are now expected to reach 81.7% in 2019, a 0.6% downwards revision since the Q4 2014 version of this report.\\n•This chapter includes two special focus pieces looking at topical events in the ammonia market. On page 44 we look at the recent gas price increases in Pakistan and the effect on nitrogen producers there. On page 35 we have included a longer piece looking at the investment rational for the newly announced Yara and BASF joint venture ammonia plant in Newport, Texas, USA.\\nTable 2.1: Changes to ammonia Capacity Since Last Quarter (exc.

The general consensus is that a rollover at $450/mt CFR would reflect expected limited price movements west of Suez, while others suggest a further decline of $15/mt is not out of the question.\\nThose few forecasting an increase in the July Tampa figure attribute their belief to continued strong US demand in an otherwise weak market. US Gulf arrivals are bolstered by Koch\\'s line-up after it recently secured just over 100,000 mt from the Black Sea and Baltic priced at around $390/mt FOB, with most tonnes destined for its domestic supply chain. There are indications that Koch is negotiating further purchases from the Baltic, Black Sea and possibly Algeria for July lifting amid reports of production issues at its US facilities.\\nUS phosphate producers Mosaic and PotashCorp are expected to run plants at normal rates, keeping ammonia demand for MAP and DAP production steady over the summer.\\nUS inland demand for ammonia may have taken a slight hit in recent weeks though, as wet weather prevented ammonia applications in most of May. It remains to be seen if US suppliers can catch up in June, or if some farmers will turn to urea/UAN instead of ammonia for supplemental applications for corn acres.\\nEast of Suez sentiment points to continued weakness on ample supply. CJ Indonesia’s tender award to Yara May 26 at $437/mt CFR evidenced little change in pricing, while Koch was able to pick up 16,000 mt from Petronas under a formula pricing arrangement to meet contract commitments in South Korea.\\nOutput at Qafco’s ammonia units continues to run well with all product used against contract commitments. Additional ammonia needs are being met by securing product from Sabic and Ameropa over the next month.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Ameropa sells 20,000 mt to Koch ex-Yuzhnny around $390/mt FOB\\n∙Koch picks up 15,000 mt from Ameropa ex-Sillamae at $390/mt FOB\\n∙Optimism that Tunisian ammonium demand will soon recover\\n∙OCP reports full ammonia tanks; seeking below $400/mt CFR for June\\n∙Muntajat to secure additional cargoes from Ameropa and Sabic\\n∙Koch buys 16,000 mt Petronas cargo against SFC commitments\\n∙Namhae seeking July/August additional cargo\\nShort term outlook:\\nSoftness will prevail in the ammonia market with pricing east and west of Suez expected to move little.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nOCP is maintaining granulation rates in June at similar levels to May and as such ammonia demand should be relatively steady particulalry as more focus is being given to MAP. In Tunisia and Jordan however, demand will remain curtailed although following the news that rock production has been resumed at one mine, GCT is expected to give priority to DAP production at Gabes and this will prompt renewed ammonia requirements.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices were stable at last week\\'s level of $1,750-1800/mt CFR China following several weeks of increases to their highest levels since early January.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: Imports needed to restock inland supply chain\\nUS ammonia imports appear likely to step up in June and July, mostly through Koch, as US suppliers take in imported material to help replenish consumption from the direct application market this spring. Speculation about July pricing at Tampa already is underway, with many market watchers betting on a flat $450/mt CFR or even lower price tag. Bullish views are less common.\\nUS Midwest: Side-dress ammonia waits for dry ground\\nWhile there are no floods underway in the US Midwest, the ground has been wet for much of the month of May, and farmers have been careful to focus on planting corn during those days suitable for field work. This has left fewer days available for finishing preplant or starting side-dress ammonia applications, according to distributors. There are anecdotal reports of higher sales of urea and UAN in recent weeks compared to seasonal norms. Price is not a factor at this stage, as ammonia remains the cheapest form of nitrogen at $605-625/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras to market ammonia cargos in H2 2015\\nPetrobras indicated it will have two ammonia spot cargoes available for lifting in H2 2015. The first will likely be marketed in August with the second available towards the end of the year.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Koch may repeat recent Baltic purchase\\nAmeropa has sold a 15,000 mt parcel to Koch reportedly around $390/mt FOB. The cargo will be loaded on the Clipper Neptune early June in Sillamae and will then pick up 25,000 mt from Uralchem in Ventspils.\\nUralchem is in negotiations as regards spot tonnage for July lifting, possibly with Koch again.\\nThe supplier will have scarce tonnes to market in August and September as its ammonia facility undergoes a maintenance shutdown.\\nBlack Sea: Koch secures more tonnes for Clipper Orion\\nKoch secured the remaining 20,000 mt it needed to complete a full 40,000 mt for loading on the Clipper Orion May 28. Its latest purchase from Ameropa is reported concluded within the current Black Sea range at $380-390/mt FOB.\\nThis follows Ameropa\\'s sale to Koch last week on the Gas Grouper for the US. Koch has chartered the vessel from Ameropa for the coming month and will likely use the vessel to shuttle between Trinidad and the US.\\nAmeropa is also in spot discussions with Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat for the sale of 23,000 mt on a CFR basis, likely to be delivered to Jordan at the end of June.\\nOPZ is currently in negotiations for the sale of another 20,000 mt in June, possibly to Koch again.\\nDespite repeated rumours of a maintenance shutdown at Group DF\\'s Russian plant scheduled for June, firm details on the timetable of such a turnaround were not disclosed at press time.\\nGroup DF\\'s suspension of nitrogen production at its Ukrainian facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot announced May 28 are unlikely to have a material effect on ammonia. The majority of ammonia produced at the units is used to produce urea and ammonium nitrate with only small volumes available for merchant use.\\nGroup DF\\'s other Ukrainian nitrogen units Gorlovka and Severodonetsk in Eastern Ukraine have been shut since May 2014 due to political unrest in the region.\\nNF Trading has around 23,000 mt spot tonnage available for June lifting:\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nQatar: Muntajat to secure additional ammonia cargoes\\nQafco’s ammonia units are running well with product fully committed for June and July with contract customers.\\nQafco’s marketing arm Muntajat said it also plans to secure a 23,000 mt cargo from Sabic and a similar sized parcel from Ameropa out of the Black Sea in the next month to be used against contract business, likely in Jordan and South Africa.\\nJordan: Subdued ammonia demand likely in near term\\nJordanian ammonia demand is likely to remain subdued in the near term as JPMC indicated it will be producing around 450,000 mt DAP this year, down from close to 650,000 mt in 2014. Increased emphasis will be given to phosphoric acid this year including shipments into Indonesia, India and Turkey.\\nTunisia: Increased optimism for the fertilizer industry\\nThere was increased optimism among market participants at the IFA Istanbul conference this week that Tunisian fertilizer production will soon get back on track.\\nCPG has re-started phosphate rock production at its Kef Eddour mine after a three-week total stoppage and months of strikes, sit-ins and general disruption.\\nAmmonia demand is not expected to increase substantially for another few weeks at least, although one 23,000 mt cargo ex-Black Sea will be arriving in Gabes early June owing to on-going AN production in Tunisia.\\nMorocco: Buyer seeks even lower values for June\\nOCP is reported targeting numbers substantially below $400/mt CFR for June ammonia deliveries.\\nAt present the buyer reports its tanks are full following a number of recent deliveries from Yuzhnny and Algeria and is in no hurry to buy additional cargo.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: No uptick in demand expected in coming months\\nIndian ammonia demand is reported stable and likely to remain so over the coming months. Despite recent arrivals of phosphoric acid into the country, supplies are still relatively limited and not substantial enough to stimulate additional ammonia demand.\\nDeepak Fertilisers will take delivery of a 7,500 mt contract cargo of ammonia ex-Iran mid June to be priced via formula. The buyer’s next spot requirement is likely to be in mid July.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Namhae seeking yet more spot cargo\\nNamhae said is in discussions for an additional 15,000 mt parcel for July/August delivery with a number of trader offers received. Namhae’s previous spot purchase was secured at $433/mt CFR from Yara several weeks ago.\\nAmmonia demand remains weak with suggestions that SFC’s affiliate Tong Suh Petrochemical Corp may reduce its acrylonitrile production rates further.\\nTaiwan: CPDC likely to buy another Iran cargo\\nCPDC will target another cargo outside contract commitments for July delivery, likely from Iran. The buyer has secured two spot cargoes from Raintrade since the start of this year and is looking to increase trade further.\\nContract prices continue to hover around $450/mt CFR but due to continued weak ammonia demand from downstream caprolactam and acrylonitrile buyers, downward price pressure is set to be maintained.\\nMalaysia: Koch buys from Petronas\\nKoch has bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for lifting on the Bunga Kemobja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.\\nIndonesia: Yara awarded CJ tender\\nCJ Indonesia has awarded its May 25 6,000 mt ammonia import tender to Yara at $437/mt CFR.\\nKaltim V is reported running ammonia at 75% capacity and urea at 45% after technical issues earlier this month.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The scenario appears unlikely to change over the coming month.\\nMost market activity continues to centre on the Black Sea as Trammo mopped up 40,000 mt from suppliers OPZ, NF Trading and DniproAzot for use against business in Turkey and Israel. The trader reports deals were fixed above $390/mt FOB, although its recent reported 7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas was said to provide Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.\\nOn-going US supply disruptions are likely the reason Koch secured an additional 40,000 mt Yuzhnny tonnes from OPZ and Ameropa for loading on the Jenny N at the end of June. These tonnes were suggested secured around the $390/mt FOB mark or marginally below.\\nDownward price pressure on such values remains as OCP continues to push for prices below $400/mt CFR for July. The buyer claims its tanks are more or less full and is in no hurry to buy additional tonnage. Tunisian demand is still limited owing to recent strikes and the suspension of phosphates fertilizers output. There are initial signs that production may gradually to normal thereby stimulating additional ammonia demand, but this may take another month at least.\\nEast of Suez, stability also reigns, with sales by Sabic to Mitsui and Fertil to Trammo concluded within the current Middle East range keeping the market balanced. Both cargoes will likely be used against contract commitments in Asia given regional buyers’ overall lack of interest in spot tonnage. This is much the same situation for Marubeni after securing 15,000 mt from Malaysia’s Petronas, with the parcel being used for contract deliveries in Japan and South Korea despite attempts to conclude a spot deal.\\nIndian ammonia demand continues to provide little cheer for suppliers although prices remain stable at $415- 450/mt CFR. Spot demand is virtually non-existent except for a small parcel sold to Tata Chemicals by Trammo at the high end of the range.\\nThe outlook is more positive in the US where Mosaic intends to run at high rates through the summer and should not have any reason to cut its ammonia consumption. It has recently lowered one of its key indicators for the US domestic DAP market and continues to be content to follow the lead of other suppliers overseas.\\nDomestic US ammonia consumption appears to be meeting expectations, based on anecdotal reports. Inland ammonia values are creeping down though, likely influenced by wet weather that may cut into ammonia\\'s side-dress business for the US corn crop.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Trammo buys 40,000 mt ex-Yuzhnny above $390/mt FOB\\n∙Koch buys 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa around $390/mt FOB\\n∙Trammo sells 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR\\n∙Fertil sells 10-15,000 mt to Trammo within publish Middle East range\\n∙Mitsui secures 23,000 mt from Sabic under formula pricing\\n∙Trammo sells under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals around $450/mt CFR\\n∙Marubeni buys 15,000 mt from Petronas under formula pricing\\nShort term outlook\\nValues are set to remain flat on regular supply and buying.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nWith MAP shipments to Brazil taking priority this month out of Morocco plus a good line up of DAP and MAP into Europe, demand for ammonia should remain solid through June. A similar trend is expected for July with MAP and DAP expected to remain the dominant products once more. Renewed demand should start to surface from Tunisia as rock supplies to the downstream plants are resumed and GCT strives to meet potential DAP commitments in Turkey and southern Europe for June shipment onwards.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Bearish DAP signals weigh on ammonia\\nSummer pricing for US domestic DAP and MAP may well fuel Mosaic and other US phosphate producers\\' determination to hold the line on ammonia costs, and perhaps even pursue a cheaper deal for July in coming weeks. Mosaic is maintaining an aggressive price stance in order to continue selling into the domestic and Latin American markets in coming weeks, and it may expect its ammonia suppliers to support that program with a reduction in the current $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.\\nUS: April imports gain thanks to FSU cargoes\\nUS ammonia arrivals in April increased marginally to 564,287 st (511,918 mt) from 515,269 st (467,449 mt) one year earlier, as FSU cargos more than made up for a decline in discharges from Trinidad and Tobago.\\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, April supplies included 359,341 st from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 368,802 st during April 2014. On the other hand imports from the FSU jumped to 88,025 st from 44,063 st over the same months. Another key supplier in April of this year was Canada at 98,261 st.\\nThe April volume brought US imports during the first 10 months of its fertilizer year to 4.87 million st (4.41 million mt). The largest ammonia suppliers to the US during July-April remain Trinidad and Tobago at 3.2 million st, Canada at 933,878 st and the FSU at 437,137 st.\\nUS Midwest: Slightly lower price tag for side-dress use\\nMidwest distributors have been more aggressive with ammonia pricing in recent days, with quotes around $600/st FOB from inland terminals east of the Mississippi River and indications cloer to $590/st FOB from terminals along the upper river system and rail quotes from the Dakotas to Iowa. Much of the corn ground still was drying out on both sides of the Mississippi River this week, but warm and dry winds increased optimism that ammonia side-dress applications would restart by the end of the week.\\nUS California: Drought remains a drag on sales\\nAmmonia in California is down at least $20/st from prior weeks, but weaker indications are unlikely to drive trade. The state continues to suffer from a three-year drought. While the state\\'s farm output and fertilizer consumption exceeded expectations despite the lack of rain, suppliers believe farming will inceasingly be limited to areas that can tap into deep wells. Farmers that rely on rainfall will be able to do less and less, further limiting the need for ammonia and other products. Recent quotes for ammonia are cited around $570- 580/st DEL.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Trammo and Koch busy once again\\nTrammo has secured 40,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers NF Trading, OPZ and DnieproAzot, suggested above $390/mt FOB. The tonnage will be lifted on the Marycam Swan and Touraine this month against business in Turkey and Israel.\\nTrammo’s recent 6-7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas for mid-June delivery reportedly provides Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.\\nKoch secured a further 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa to load June 20-25 on the Jenny N, also suggested fixed at $390/mt FOB or marginally below. Early indications are that the vessel will head to the US given on-going reports of production issues at Koch’s US facilities.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Trammo sells another cargo to Bagfas\\nTrammo is linked to the sale of 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR for mid June delivery this week, reflecting a slight weakening in values. Trammo will use the Sylvie which has finished loading in Rouen for the transaction\\nPetkim said it will likely issue an enquiry for 6,000 mt spot cargo at the end of June for mid July delivery.\\nGemlik, meanwhile, has no ammonia available for export at present with all plants running well.\\nToros and Trammo have signed a five year ammonia supply agreement, formalizing their existing relationship. Trammo will supply ammonia to Toros across the producer\\'s sites in Samsun, Ceyhan and Mersin over the five years on a regular basis for the majority of Toros\\' annual requirement.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea units back up soon\\nAlgerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nTunisia: Recovery in fertilizer production continues\\nAmeropa confirmed it will be directing either the Gas Cobia or Gas Manta with 23,000 mt to Tunisia this month as AN production continues.\\nThere was further optimism this week that Tunisian fertilizer output is slowly getting back on track. Phosphate rock production at the Kef Eddour mine has resumed and phosphate rock will then be supplied to the downstream plants. This will in turn boost ammonia demand.\\nMorocco: Imports up as OCP takes another NF cargo\\nMoroccan ammonia imports for March 2015 at 61,623 mt ran 8.7% ahead of the same time last year, prompted by low ammonia values and greater tank storage capacity.\\nYear-to-date figures are up 7% at 219,359 mt helped by a strong import month in February.\\nThis year has seen OCP diversify its ammonia supply sources with product arriving from the Black Sea and Algeria. It has also secured ammonia directly from Black Sea suppliers such as NF Trading and chartered vessels from traders to bring the cargo to Jorf Lasfar.\\nThe Gaschem Stade is expected back in Yuzhnny June 9 to load another 23,000 mt Rossosh material for OCP with the buyer claiming the deal was was struck around $400/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by the supplier.\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic concludes another spot deal\\nSabic has sold 23,000 mt to Mitsui under a formula pricing arrangement for mid July loading. The vessel has not yet been nominated but ther cargo will be directed to the Far East for use against Mitsui\\'s contract commitments in the region.\\nUAE: Fertil books ammonia sale with Trammo\\nFertil has sold 10-15,000 mt ammonia to Trammo within the current Middle East index range. The cargo will be lifted in July on the Brussels against contract business in the Far East.\\nIts 760,000 mt/year Fertil I urea line and the 430,000 mt/year ammonia line were shut down last month for maintenance and were due to restart at the end of May. This has now been pushed back to June 9-10.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: No improvement in demand, and prices stable\\nIndian ammonia demand remains lacklustre and prices are still pegged at $415-450/mt CFR.\\nTrammo said it sold under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia off the Tobolsk at the high end of the Indian index price.\\nIFFCO is set to receive a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars at the end of June.\\nIndia: FACT issues ammonia tender closing June 5\\nFACT has issued a new ammonia import tender for 7,500 mt closing June 5. Shipment is requested 26-30 June Cochin.\\nThis follows the scrapping of its May 11 tender for 2x7,500 mt due to high priced offers. The buyer said it is seeking offers in the low $400s/mt CFR in the latest session.\\nFACT had hoped to restart its Udyogamandal ammonia facility this month but this has now been postponed until June 1.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nMalaysia: Marubeni secures Petronas cargo\\nMarubeni is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt Petronas cargo for July lifting on the Bunga Kemboja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will likely be used against contract commitments in the Far East.\\nLast week Koch bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for June lifting on the Bunga Kemobja, also under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo is to be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae pushes back spot ideas to September\\nNamhae had now fixed its contract delivery schedule up to the first half of August and will likely push back any enquiries for tonnage outside contract volumes to September.\\nAround 8,000 mt will be discharged in Ulsan next week by Mitsubishi off the Sanko Innovator, followed by a 15,000 mt parcel from Yara off the Nordic River that was recently secured under a spot deal at $433/mt CFR.\\nSentiment that prices may weaken further in the region owing to poor industrial demand remains, although Middle East buyers contend prices should firm in response to limited spot cargo availability.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

This is compounded by Koch’s repeat 40,000 mt purchases from the Black Sea and Baltic, rapidly absorbing any spare spot availability.\\nIt is unclear whether the reported issues at Koch’s US facilities driving this activity will continue beyond July. Additionally the removal from the merchant ammonia market of Rossosh tonnage, which has limited outlets due to US and EU sanctions, might not have as much of an impact as initially feared.\\nNF Trading’s central customer of late OCP has diversified its ammonia suppliers and has recently secured a supply agreement with OPZ, also using the Gaschem Stade on a regular basis. Ameropa in turn is easily covering Koch’s demands and is supplying 40,000 mt on the Jenny N this month at a reported $380/mt FOB keeping prices stable.\\nAdditional supply west of Suez is easing upward price pressure with Turkey’s Gemlik selling a small parcel to Yara in the low $400s/mt FOB. The Turkish tonnage enters the EU free of duty. Ameropa meanwhile fixed a dutiable cargo with Yara out of Sillamae some $10/mt lower. Algeria also reported that its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants have returned to commercial output after shutting down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nEast of Suez jitters are noted in anticipation of the Safco V urea plant start-up expected at the end of June and the resulting removal of substantial merchant ammonia volumes from the market. Further production issues at the Malaysian Petronas ammonia unit and a recent temporary shutdown at Yara’s Pilbara facility likely prompted Mitsui to pay $437.50/mt FOB in Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 ammonia tender, $26 above the supplier’s reserve price.\\nIndian buyers are enquiring about spot availability from the Far East with regional traders to help mitigate against potential sharp price increases from Middle East producers from July. Recent Indian spot sales have been made by Trammo in the mid $400s/mt CFR with Tata and SPIC. Buyers will strongly resist further price increases given that demand is anticipated to be fairly lacklustre in the month ahead due to increased DAP imports of late. FACT rejected Trammo’s $515/mt CFR offer following its June 5 tender and will use ammonia from its own Udyogamandal ammonia facility which recently restarted.\\nIn the US, despite improved weather ammonia seems to be losing the competition with UAN for much of the spot nitrogen demand for side-dress in the Midwest. The swing demand is modest as a function of total spring nitrogen demand, but it likely means more ammonia carryover this summer compared to recent years.\\nExpectations of a cheaper price tag at Tampa for July imports are growing among US Gulf players despite the relatively flat market overseas. July talks might get under way late next week.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Ameropa supplies full 40,000 mt to Koch on Jenny N\\n∙Group DF may import Rossosh ammonia to run Ukraine AN\\n∙Igsas buys 7,000 mt from Ameropa around $410/mt FOB\\n∙Gemlik sells 12,000 mt to Yara in low $400s/mt FOB\\n∙Algeria restarts Sorfert I ammonia and urea units\\n∙Ameropa sells 8,000 mt to Yara out of Sillamae\\n∙Safco V urea plant set to start soon\\n∙Pupuk Kaltim sells 20,000 mt to Mitsui at $437.50/mt FOB\\n∙Trammo sells 6-10,000 mt to SPIC at $450/mt CFR\\n∙Tampa July negotiations may start next week\\nShort term outlook\\nDifficult to predict although prices in most markets east and west of Suez are believed to have reached a floor with the possible exception of the Tampa price to be fixed for July. Momentum to increase prices is slow although there might be a slight uptick in July.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nAs Brazilian MAP shipments are at their peak and are expected to remains so through June and July, Moroccan demand for ammonia will remain firm. Going forward, much will depend on the outcome of the next round of phosphoric acid negotiations for Q3 in India and Europe which are due to start in the next two weeks.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Ammonia applications step up\\nAmmonia use for side-dress applications has disappointed somewhat this season due to uncooperative weather across the region. Application work is undeway, but the rapid growth of corn so far this season means UAN or urea may be required for some acres that typically rely on ammonia, due to application limitations. More aggressive pricing in prior weeks has helped, however. Ammonia postings are $590-615/st FOB.\\nUS Tampa: Buyers aim for cheaper July imports\\nMosaic and other importers of ammonia across the US Gulf are hoping for a cheaper price tag for imported ammonia in July. Some key overseas benchmarks that influence the Tampa price tag have been stable for several weeks, but US domestic values have fallen ahead of the normal summer fill market. Importers taking ammonia to the Midwest and to Texas likely would like to see a reduction in costs reflecting their reduced resale opportunities. The June price tag settled at $450/mt CFR Tampa.\\nUS S Plains: Ammonia down as demand evaporating\\nAmmonia has almost no role left this season for crops in the South. Much of the nitrogen demand going forward is tied to the rice market, where only urea is employed. As a result some aggresive pricing is available to retailers willing to take positions now that likely will still be in hand when the fall season arrives. Recent spot offers are cited at $520-540/st FOB in Oklahoma.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic: Yara secures 8,000 mt parcel from Ameropa\\nYara will load 8,000 mt on the Temse in Sillamae June 13 after fixing a deal with Ameropa around $390/mt FOB. The vessel will head to Finland for use within Yara’s own system.\\nUralchem is still reported to have spot volumes available for July loading.\\nBlack Sea: Ameropa supplies full 40,000 mt to Koch\\nAmeropa has now emerged as the sole supplier of 40,000 mt to be loaded on the Jenny N for Koch at the end of June. The cargo is believed secured around $380/mt FOB for shipment most likely to the US, with Taft as the intended port of discharge.\\nOPZ had initially been slated to provide 20,000 mt to Koch for the latest lifting. The supplier has now said one of its marketers Nitora will load 23,000 mt on the Gaschem Stade for late June lifting for OCP under an existing contract, after the vessel completes its prior voyage to Morocco with a cargo sourced from NF Trading.\\nAmeropa’s Gas Snapper is expected to arrive in Yuzhnny June 14 and will load 23,500 mt for JPMC in Jordan after a deal was fixed with Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat. The transaction was concluded under a formula pricing arrangement.\\nAmeropa will also load 23,000 mt on the Sylvie June 20 under a product swap with Trammo. Trammo is currently loading a similar volume on the Clipper Mars.\\nTrammo is discussing purchasing another 25,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers for lifting on the Touraine in July.\\nIt was announced this week that two of Group DF’s Ukrainian nitrogen facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot will cease production of ammonia to conduct an overhaul of the lines. Scarcely any merchant ammonia was being sourced from either facility of late with production suspended late May owing to political pressure.\\nAmmonium nitrate (AN) output is reportedly resuming in July at both plants and as such ammonia will likely be imported from Group DF’s Rossosh facility in Russia. Rossosh is likely reluctant to agree to such a supply deal though.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Ameropa sells cargo to Igsas\\nTurkish values are reported unchanged at $410-420/mt CFR with Ameropa selling 7,000 mt to Igsas at the lower end of the range. The cargo has already been discharged off the Gas Cobia.\\nYara\\'s Pertusola will lift the 12,000 mt it recently secured from Gemlik in the low $400s/mt FOB June 13.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Muntajat secures Ameropa cargo\\nMuntajat has concluded a 23,500 mt deal with Ameropa under a formula pricing arrangement. Ameropa will load the cargo on the Gas Snapper for JPMC in Jordan.\\nSabic reports that its ammonia plants are running well and that its Safco V urea plant is currently undergoing production trials.\\nTrammo will use the Berlian Ekuator and Brussels to lift the 23,000 mt it secured two weeks ago. The additional optional tonnage it secured will be lifted at the end of June.\\nMorocco: OCP in market for July/August tonnage\\nOCP is next seeking tonnage for late July/early August delivery and continues to push for values below $400/mt CFR.\\nTunisia: Ameropa delivers less ammonia off Gas Cobia\\nAmeropa’s Gas Cobia will discharge just 16,000 mt contract cargo in Gabes in the coming days. This follows a brief interruption in AN production, reducing ammonia demand.\\nThe Gabes plant is yet to re-start both sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid production due to irregular rock supplies.Miners have returned to work but deliveries of rock are still subject to sporadic sit-ins and blockades. It is hoped that a return to regular supply and therefore a return to phosacid and fertilizer production will be achieved by the start of Ramadan on June 18.\\nAlgeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up\\nAlgerian producer Sorfert said its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants returned to commercial output June 8. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Buyers unsure ahead of Safco V urea start-up\\nIndian ammonia demand remains stable this week. Trammo revealed it sold 6-10,000 mt ammonia to SPIC at $450/mt CFR for prompt delivery to Tuticorin off the Tobolosk. This follows its sale of under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia last week.\\nEnquiries are reported from buyers seeking product for July delivery from Far East suppliers in anticipation of the Safco V urea unit coming on stream at the end of June, removing a substantial volume of Middle East merchant ammonia from the market.\\nThis is despite recent indications that ammonia import volumes into India will be unchanged in the short term as high DAP imports over the past few months place pressure on domestic DAP output. It has been suggested that producers might increasingly focus on NPK production which may require less ammonia than DAP, depending on grades produced.\\nFuture Indian demand will largely depend on the phosphoric acid price fixed for Q3. OCP will begin negotiations over the price level in the next fortnight. Indian buyers will be seeking a decrease in price versus Q1 and Q2 while OCP is likely looking for at least a rollover. If the price is reduced, domestic DAP production should pick up.\\nRupee depreciation and monsoon concerns will likely continue to temper demand from the industry going forward.\\nIndia: FACT scraps latest ammonia tender\\nFACT scrapped its ammonia June 5 import tender for 7,500 mt due to the high priced offer received. Delivery had been requested for June 26-30 arrival at Cochin.\\nTrammo submitted an offer at $515/mt CFR, at least $65/mt higher than the current India price index.\\nFACT is not expected to retender given that its Udyogamandal ammonia facility restarted production early June after a temporary closure due to a lack of gas supply.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nMalaysia: Petronas restarts ammonia facility\\nMalaysia’s Petronas ammonia facility has reportedly restarted after a three week shutdown due to technical\\nissues.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae and SFC receive spot offers\\nA number of suppliers have contacted Namhae and SFC over the past week to gauge interest in spot cargoes for July delivery.\\nNamhae and SFC have limited tank space for additional cargoes before August due to contract commitments but should price offers be competitive, they may consider small parcels in July. The buyers consider values at $440-450/mt CFR attractive given Mitsui’s recent Kaltim purchase at $437.50/mt FOB.\\nNamhae will receive a total 33,000 mt contract cargo before the end of June from Mitsubishi, Yara and Trammo and a similar volume in the first half of July from Mitsubishi and Marubeni.\\nSFC has 31,000 mt contract volume arriving before the end of June from Sabic and Koch.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim awards tender to Mitsui\\nKaltim has awarded its June 11 tender for the sale of 20,000 mt ammonia to Mitsui at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June. Trammo bid at $420/mt FOB and Fertzcomm at $380/mt FOB. The cargo will be taken to the Far East, likely for use against a mix of contract and spot business.\\nCJ Indonesia has issued another 6,000 mt import tender for July 28-30 arrival closing June 16. The buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.\\nTaiwan: CPDC could secure additional tonnes in August\\nCPDC will delay attempts to secure cargo outside contract commitments to August arrival due to full ammonia storage tanks at present.\\nIran’s Raintrade will likely deliver a 10-15,000 mt spot cargo to CPDC during August although negotiations are on-going. The buyer is targeting values around $430/mt CFR following Yara’s sale to Namhae at that level several weeks ago.\\nContract values are pegged $10-15/mt higher with Mitsui expected to discharge a total 15,000 mt off the Gas Quantum and Gaz Millennium late June.\\nMitsui may discharge an additional 23,000 mt late July/early August for CPDC. It is possible that 15,000 mt will be delivered under contract with the balance sold as spot.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Future price direction remains unclear and a number of market participants are holding off from concluding deals in the meantime.\\nIn anticipation of further purchases by Koch in the Black Sea and Baltic for July lifting, Yara has sought cover for 20,000 mt from several Baltic suppliers at an even $400/mt FOB, up $10/mt on the previous index. This was in response to a recent ammonia plant fire at Yara’s Brunsbüttel facility in Germany which affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire remains unclear.\\nBlack Sea activity proved calmer with no new cargoes believed traded. Netbacks declined to the mid\\n$370s/mt FOB in recent sales by Trammo into Turkey and Morocco with downward price pressure from both buying nations forecast to continue. OCP is still pushing for values at a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny equivalent although Black Sea suppliers are so far refusing to accept the demands for lower prices.\\nSuppliers east of Suez have maintained upward price pressure with the presumed start-up the Safco V granular urea plant at the end of June certain to reduce available merchant ammonia volumes. As yet the vast majority of Asian buyers have resisted such price attempts, with South Korean buyers still claiming no interest in additional cargoes outside contract volumes until the end of July at the earliest.\\nSouth east Asian values have already noted a $11/mt uptick to $448/mt CFR following CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award to Petrokimia Gresik. This is likely a reaction to the high-priced 20,000 mt Kaltim sale to Mitsui at $437.50 FOB last week. It is suggested this cargo may be used against a reported sale to Orica around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery.\\nIndian ammonia demand will be the key to future price development east of Suez. Satisfactory monsoon rainfall is being recorded for June but drier conditions in July could prompt a build-up of DAP inventories, possibly lowering ammonia demand. Negotiations on Q3 phosphoric acid prices are on-going.\\nIn the US Gulf, CF is receiving ammonia through Yara that is enabling it to begin test runs on it new urea train at Donaldsonville Louisiana. That plant will run on imported ammonia until first half 2016 when the planned ammonia unit at the site comes on line.\\nNegotiations on the Tampa July price tag are yet to begin in earnest as both parties wait for the market direction to become clearer. Various sources have mooted a rollover from June’s $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.\\nFill offers for ammonia to be delivered ahead of the fall application season in inland US reported earlier this week by Fertilizer Week were fairly aggressive at around $540/st FOB in the Midwest from a limited number of suppliers. The pricing suggests suppliers have seen greater than normal carryover from the spring season.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Koch still seeking Black Sea and Baltic cargoes\\n∙Trammo sells to Petkim in low $400/mt CFR\\n∙OCP buys 25,000 mt from Trammo in low $400s/mt CFR\\n∙Australia\\'s Orica buys 19,000 mt from a trader around $500/mt CFR\\n∙CJ Indonesia awards tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR\\n∙July Tampa price negotiations to start soon\\nShort term outlook\\nFurture price direction remains unclear with a combination of price increases and declines noted east and west of Suez.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nDAP production remains suspended at GCT\\'s Gabes plant as rock supplies are subject to further disruptions, limiting ammonia imports. For July OCP is expected to place greater emphasis on MAP/DAP production over NPKs to cover commitments in Brazil and Europe although demand in Brazil remains extremely\\nsubdued. Nevertheless, OCP will be hoping to balance granulation with steady Indian phosacid shipments but acid volumes will depend on the eventual price settled for Q3. Negotiations for this are ongoing.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were overall fairly stable and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nTampa: July pricing focus of market attention\\nMosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.\\nUS NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down\\nPossible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.\\nFor now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers cited below cash market\\nDistributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Yara buys 20,000 mt at $400/mt FOB\\nYara has secured 20,000 mt ammonia from Baltic suppliers at a reported $400/mt FOB for July lifting. The cargo will be taken to Yara’s European units in Sweden, Finland and France after a fire at Yara’s ammonia plant in Brunsbüttel, Germany late last week affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire is still unclear.\\nKoch is still reported negotiating the purchase of a further 40,000 mt cargo with Baltic suppliers for July lifting.\\nBlack Sea: Netbacks down on CFR sales at lower prices\\nBlack Sea trade has been extremely quiet with prices under downward pressure.\\nA recent sale to Turkey’s Petkim points to Yuzhnny values in the $370s/mt FOB while a 25,000mt Trammo sale to OCP possibly off the Touraine is reported providing netbacks in a similar range.\\nTrammo will lift a further 5-8,000 mt ex-DnieproAzot on the Marycam Swan late June or on the Touraine early July pursuant to a deal concluded several weeks ago around $390/mt FOB. It is unclear where the balance tonnage will be sourced from.\\nTrammo’s Sylvie which be loaded with 23,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot June 26 under a product swap with Ameropa will likely be directed to buyers east of Suez under spot and contract business.\\nKoch is reported back in negotiations with Black Sea suppliers for a 40,000 mt cargo for July lifting. The trader\\'s Jenny N will lift a similar volume June 25 for the US.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Petkim buys small parcel from Trammo\\nTurkey\\'s Petkim has secured 6,000 mt from Trammo for mid-July delivery in the low $400s/mt CFR. This is at least $8/mt down on previous sales done in the country to Bagfas and Igsas.\\nBagfas is reported in the market for another 6-7,000 mt for July delivery.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nTunisia: Short term ammonia demand unchanged\\nTunisian ammonia demand is unlikely to significantly improve over the coming weeks. There is still no reported DAP production as Gabes and rock supply is still subject to some disruption.\\nMorocco: OCP keeps pressure on Black Sea suppliers\\nOCP continues to push for ammonia cargoes below $400/mt CFR equating to a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny netback.\\nTrammo\\'s recent 25,000 mt sale to OCP off the Touraine for early July delivery was reported fixed in the low $400s/mt CFR.\\nMiddle East: Scarce activity as Ramadan begins\\nRamadan observance commenced this week with limited Middle East activity reported.\\nAll Sabic units are reported running as normal. The Safco V urea plant continues to undergo trials and given no further updates it is assumed that full capacity production is still expected to start at the end of June.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand flat and prices steady\\nIndian demand is reported flat week-on-week with prices unchanged at $415-450/mt CFR.\\nIFFCO will take delivery of a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars early July.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nAustralia: Orica linked to 19,000 mt spot purchase\\nAustralian ammonium nitrate (AN) producer Orica has reportedly secured 19,000 mt ammonia from a trader around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery owing to a technical issue at its plant.\\nMitsui could conceivably be the provider of the cargo after being awarded Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 sales- tender at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June.\\nYara’s 759,000 mt/year Pilbara ammonia facility is running normally after another technical issue interrupted production early June.\\nTaiwan: Buyers resist potential price increases\\nTaiwanese buyers report suppliers’ attempts to push prices up are gaining little traction.\\nDemand remains weak from industrial consumers while fertilizer usage will decrease over the coming two months during the off-season.\\nTFC received one 23,000 mt contract cargo discharged June 15 priced at $430-440/mt CFR with a similar sized cargo to follow July 20.\\nIndonesia: Petrokimia Gresik linked to CJ tender\\nAn award in CJ Indonesia\\'s June 16 import tender for 6,000 mt is reported to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR. Delivery was requested July 28-30. The product will likely be sourced from Pupuk Kaltim.\\nThe buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.\\nSouth Korea: Imports down on lower contract deliveries\\nSouth Korea ammonia imports for May down 14% at 74,030 mt reflect continued weak demand from industrial consumers.\\nJanuary-May figures show an almost identical picture for imports, down 15% at 435,259 mt.\\nContract ammonia deliveries have been reduced in 2015 owing to an expected decrease in demand with any urgent needs covered by spot purchases from Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.\\nImports from Australia for the first five months of this year fell 1% to 179,548 mt while offtake from Saudi Arabia was down 71% at 69,617 mt.

Black Sea pricing remains unchanged while pricing for ammonia delivered to Tampa in April was lifted a mere $10/mt last week to $485/mt CFR.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nCurrent weakness in pricing and demand east of Suez looks to set to continue into April. The Indian H1 phosphoric acid price fixed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit this week, an increase of $40/mt on the H2 2014 price, means Indian buyers will continue to apply substantial pressure on Middle East producers to reduce prices further in order to make a margin in production and sales of DAP. Buyers in South Korea and Taiwan predict little improvement in downstream demand from acrylonitrile producers in the near term and are trying to reduce inventories accordingly.\\nMiddle East spot values have been revised downwards reflecting Marubeni’s recent 5,000 mt ex-Bangladesh sale to CIL in India at $430/mt CFR. Theoretical netbacks would suggest values of $370/mt FOB Middle East taking into account Fertilizer Week’s Middle East– East Coast India commercial/spot freight assessment around $60/mt. Allowing for an adjustment to reflect the low freight for Marubeni on the proximity of Kakinada to Chittagong, and assuming a time charter rate for a conveyance to Kakinada from the Middle East closer to or below $50/mt, netbacks are however pegged at $380/mt FOB.\\nSupplier offers for additional cargoes reported at $470/mt CFR in South Korea and Taiwan and CJ Indonesia’s purchase from Mitsui at $465/mt CFR this week also support similar or even lower returns if shipped from the Middle East.\\nStability prevails west of Suez where little change in values was noted despite purchases from Koch in Yuzhnny and Ventspils. OPZ’s 40,000 mt sale to Koch was secured within the $400-410/mt FOB range while Baltic netbacks slipped to $410-420/mt FOB as the trader secured a mix of Achema, Uralchem and TogliattiAzot tonnage for April loading on the Clipper Neptun.\\nExpectations of further price increases in US Gulf ammonia after last week’s April price fixture might conceivably benefit from\\nevents overseas, including the unrest in Yemen. Demand expectations from US phosphate giant Mosaic are flat, while summer purchases will depend in part on how much ammonia is consumed during the US spring planting season.\\nInland, ammonia application work is under way in a few parts of the Corn Belt and the pace should pick up substantially in the next two weeks due to cooperative weather. Markets in the south, which consume far less direct application ammonia, have been less fortunate. Rain is reported again in Oklahoma and Arkansas and there is a significant possibility that farmers may turn to urea if they can in coming weeks, should ammonia equipment fail to enter fields due to soggy conditions.\\nHighlights of the week\\nKoch secures Black Sea cargo around $400-410/mt FOB Baltic values at $410-420/mt FOB via sale to Koch Bagfas buys 5,000 mt from Trammo at $430-440/mt FOB Middle East values slide to $380/mt FOB via netbacks calculated on CIL India deal at $430/mt CFR\\nMPC ammonia unit down; Qafco units III, V and VI still shut CJ Indonesia tender awarded at $465/mt CFR to Mitsui Demand in Far East still dire; spot offers in region around $470/mt CFR\\nTampa April fixed at $485/mt CFR\\nShort term outlook\\nThe spread between Middle East and Black Sea pricing looks set to widen in the coming month. Indian and Far Eastern buyers will continue to place downwards pressure on pricing of cargoes emanating from Saudi Arabia and Qatar while optimism in the US for spring ammonia application will likely provide a boost to Black Sea prices.\\nAMMONIA | 2\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nFollowing on from this week\\'s conclusion of the phosphoric acid price in India, ammonia has become the key driver for the phosphate market there. If ammonia prices are maintained at a level of around $440/mt CFR or assessed even lower, Indian producers will in turn maintain a reasonably steady level of DAP production. This will mean that OCP will be able to switch back to shipping increased volumes of phosphoric acid in Q2 rather than granulating larger quantities as it has done in Q1.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices increased week on week to $1,650-1,700/mt CFR to $1,600-1,650/mt CFR China, continuing the rebound from the downward spiral the underwent from September 2014 to January of this year.\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nUS MIDWEST\\nAmmonia starts moving in US Corn Belt\\nThe direct application ammonia work began in southern Indiana and Illinois this week. Ground conditions still are not suitable across most of the Midwest and the Dakotas. Nevertheless, the early start before April 1 suggests not only sufficient time to move spring and carried- over prepaid ammonia but to allow for re-fill business later in the season.\\nPrices across the Midwest are cited from a low of about $580/st FOB west of the Mississippi River to $615/st FOB farther east. Rail delivered quotes in the Midwest and the Dakotas are $580/st DEL.\\nAMMONIA | 3\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nBarge indications narrow modestly\\nModerate gains in import costs and lower sales values in some up- river markets have squeezed the indicated range for New Orleans ammonia barges to $463-517/st FOB. However, the midpoint between the current spread and prior weeks\\' indications moved up just $4.50/st as a result of the shift.\\nUS TAMPA\\nGulf trade now waiting for overseas reactions to increase\\nDespite bullish expectations from ammonia suppliers, key US buyers are waiting to see if overseas endusers support continued increases in ammonia costs. If other enduser markets do not move up independently of the April Tampa price tag of $485/mt CFR, Yara and other sellers can expect substantial resistance from fertilizer and industrial buyers in coming weeks to higher indications. The April price moved up $10/mt late last week based on a settlement between Mosaic and yara.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBALTIC SEA\\nKoch buys up Baltic tonnes\\nKoch\\'s Clipper Orion is expected to arrive in Ventspils April 4-9 to load a 40,000 mt cargo reportedly secured at $410-420/mt FOB. Up to 12,000 mt is understood to have been sourced from Achema, just 1,000 mt from Ameropa and the balance from Uralchem.\\nKoch secures cargo from OPZ\\nOPZ is understood to have agreed the sale of 40,000 mt to Koch for lifting April 15-20 on the Clipper Neptun within the $400-410/mt FOB range. Up to 12,000 mt will be loaded by TogliattiAzot in a return swap after OPZ supplied a similar volume to Koch earlier this month for loading on the Jenny N following Ameropa\\'s 40,000 mt sale.\\nTrammo\\'s Sylvie is currently loading a mixture of OPZ and TogliattiAzot tonnage for Turkey where a reported 5,000 mt sale to Bagfas provides Black Sea netbacks in the low $400s/mt FOB.\\nAmeropa will load 23,500 mt on the Cambridge early April for OCP under an existing agreement between the parties.\\nTrammo\\'s Marycam Swan will return to Yuzhnny in April to load\\n15,000 mt sourced from TogliattiAzot in another return swap:\\nAmmonia Black Sea line-up – March 2015\\nVESSELQUANTITY TRADER COUNTRY STATUS\\nAmmonia Black Sea line-up – April 2015\\nAMMONIA | 4\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nTotal23,500\\nEUROPE\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nTURKEY\\nINDIA\\nBagfas buys cargo from Trammo\\nBagfas is linked to a 5,000 mt purchase from Trammo at $430- 440/mt FOB providing Black Sea netbacks in the low 400s/mt FOB.\\nPetkim is also reported to have secured 6,000 mt at around the same price.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSAUDI ARABIA\\nMPC forced to shut down ammonia facility again\\nMiddle East suppliers are still reported offering cargoes outside contract commitments to Far Eastern customers despite a number of plant shutdowns. Reports that Mitsui may have secured a small spot cargo for lifting on the Gas Oriental in April in conjunction with PIC Kuwait contract tonnes could not be verified at press time.\\nSabic\\'s joint venture the Ma\\'aden Phosphate Company (MPC) shut down its ammonia plant March 24 so that unscheduled maintenance can be carried out on its cooling facility. The ammonia unit only restarted after a 30-day scheduled maintenance February 22.\\nThe company said in a bourse filing that the shutdown at the Ras Al Khair (RAK) facility would last for around 10 days. The plant closure may affect availability of merchant ammonia given that the company said it would continue to produce DAP using existing ammonia stocks.\\nMuntajat said Qafco\\'s Ammonia III, V and VI plants remain shut down undergoing maintenance until the end of March with low ammonia inventories for April.\\nSpot values have been adjusted downwards reflecting Marubeni’s recent 5,000 mt ex-Bangladesh sale to CIL in India at $430/mt CFR. Theoretical netbacks would suggest values of $370/mt FOB Middle East taking into account Fertilizer Week’s Middle East –East Coast India commercial/spot freight assessment around $60/mt. Allowing for an adjustment to reflect the low freight for Marubeni on the proximity of Kakinada to Chittagong, and assuming a time charter rate for a conveyance to Kakinada from the Middle East closer to or below $50/mt, netbacks are pegged at $380/mt FOB.\\nThe CJ Indonesia purchase from Mitsui at $465/mt CFR this week would have yielded a similar or even lower return, if shipped from the Middle East.\\nIndia prices move lower on CIL purchase\\nMarubeni sold a 5-6,000 mt spot cargo ex-Bangladesh to CIL at $430/mt CFR this week. The Gaschem Stade will load 10,000 mt in Chittagong March 28-29 under a long term supply contract and discharge half the cargo in Kakinada for CIL early April followed by the delivery of the balance 5,000 mt for SPIC in Tuticorin concluded several weeks ago within the $470-480/mt CFR range.\\nIFFCO said its 40,000 mt ex-Black Sea cargo off the Clipper Mars finished discharging March 24. The tonnes were reported priced via formula at $470-480/mt CFR.\\nRaintrade will deliver a 23,000 mt contract volume via CIFC end March/early April to Paradip off the Gas Line. The price of the cargo has not yet been settled.\\nThe impact on ammonia demand following the H1 phosphoric acid price fixed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit, an increase of $40/mt P2o5 on the H2 2014 price, is as yet unclear. Given current ammonia values as low as $430/mt CFR, DAP output will likely be boosted despite the higher phosphoric acid price.\\nShould NP/NPK production prove more attractive in the short term, it is likely ammonia imports would be sustained at current levels given that grades such as 20-20-0 require more N than DAP.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nINDONESIA\\nCJ Indonesia tender awards tender to Mitsui\\nCJ Indonesia reportedly awarded its March 25 ammonia import tender for 6,000 mt for early May delivery to Mitsui at $465/mt CFR. Offers from Trammo, Yara and Fertcomm were at least $20/mt higher.\\nAMMONIA | 5\\nSOUTH KOREA\\nValues fall on multiple supplier offers\\nSouth Korean values edged down to $470-490/mt CFR with a number of supplier offers for additional cargoes for May delivery at the low end of the range.\\nNamhae has not ruled out the possibility of securing another cargo for May discharge, while SFC said high inventories due to weak downstream demand from acrylonitrile producers was an ongoing issue.\\nThe Taekwang acrylonitrile chemical complex was initially shut down February 25 through mid March but will now not reopen until mid April due to technical issues and poor demand. SFC suggested that when the facility restarts it is unlikely to operate at full capacity.\\nTAIWAN\\nCPDC may secure additional cargo for May delivery\\nCPDC continues to report being approached by Middle Eastern and Asian suppliers keen to gauge interest in a 10,000 mt addtional cargo outside contract commitments for May delivery. The buyer said it needs to determine its contract delivery schedule for May before it makes a decision on any extra ammonia volumes.\\nPrices are pegged at $470-490/mt CFR although further falls in prices over the coming weeks are not inconceivable given ample supply and ongoing weak demand in the region.\\nCPDC will receive 23,000 mt contract cargo from Mitsui off the Gas Oriental April 17.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nJennifer Willis-Jones , Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer.willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7811 145370\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nCopyright notice:\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The more positive tone was reflected in southeast Asia this week, where Mitsui has been awarded the Kaltim tender for 20,000t for end-June loading from Bontang at $437.50/t cfr.\\nA tighter market in the east is becoming evident, and in India, FACT this week announced that it had scrapped its tender for 7,500t for late-June delivery to Cochin, hav- ing only received one offer from Trammo at $515/t cfr. Prices into India are assessed in the $420-465/t cfr range, Trammo has this week said it has sold a cargo to SPIC at\\n$450/t cfr, suggesting a firmer trend in prices. Transagri this week reported that its ex-Iran cargo to IFFCO Kandla which discharged last week was priced at $402/t cfr, significantly below prices announced this week.\\nIn Yuzhny prices are still assessed in the $380-390/t fob range, although one trader is reportedly looking to sell ton- nage at $400/t fob this week. Latest netbacks on sales into Turkey are estimated to netback to around $380-385/t fob, while spot business is closer to the $390/t level.

Corn in many regions is reaching heights that prevent further sidedress. Inventory is low heading into summer, so price declines have been measured. There were, however, some reports of more aggressive offers this week, although there were likely limited volumes concluded at these price levels.\\nThe most notable declines were at Oklahoma production points. One producer dropped offers to as low as $470/ st fot, down from about $525/st fot just last week. Other production sites held offers closer to $500/st fot. Although offers were significantly lower than last week, consensus among traders is that limited tons were sold at these values.\\nThe range of offers in the west Corn Belt has moved lower and widened. Asking prices are still as high as $595/st fot in northeast Iowa, but have fallen to as low as $520/st near the Iowa-Nebraska border. Further sidedress consumption in that area is expected to be limited with most of these applica- tions done with UAN.\\nHigher numbers in the east Corn Belt have now receded with offers now in the range of $600-620/st. Offers are higher moving east with only limited business done at $620/st fot in Indiana.\\nSome of the crop, particularly in the east Corn Belt, has only now reached the emergence stage, which should bode well for a long tail to consumption into summer. At least one supplier has recently moved new tons to East Corn Belt terminals via barge.\\nArgus FMB East Europe\\nFertilizer 2015\\n17-19 June | Prague\\nJoin 150+ companies at the only fertilizer networking event in eastern Europe.

At least some of cargo is due to be loaded on the Berlian Ekuator from Saudi Arabia this week. Pricing and volumes of the cargo could not be confirmed by press time; Trammo said the delivery was not a swap with Muntajat.\\nMarket Outlook: Slight firming trend\\nEurope\\nYuzhny\\nYuzhny pricing was stable/slightly firmer this week. Trammo has purchased around 20,000t from NF Trading for load- ing on the Touraine, priced at around $390/t fob according to Trammo. NF Trading declined to comment on this price however. In addition, Trammo has bought around 3,000t of DniproAzot ammonia at a price of around $400/t fob. The volume is below our 5,000t minimum cargo size to be in- cluded in our price assessment, so the Yuzhny price for this week is quoted at the $380-390/t fob level, but the outlook looks slightly firmer. The low-end level of $380/t fob reflects estimated netbacks on recent sales done into Turkey.\\nAmeropa has just completed loading the Gas Snapper which will be delivered to Jordan, under a cfr sale to Muntajat to cover its delivery to JPMC.\\nKoch’s Jenny N is expected to arrive around 25 June to load 40,000t of Togliatti ammonia for delivery to the US.\\nBaltic\\nYara has secured 20,000t of ammonia out of the Baltic for\\nJuly loading which it will ship to Germany. Yara says the tonnage was sourced from more than one Baltic supplier and was priced at around $400/t fob Ventpils and Sillamae. The Ventspils fob price is this week assessed at $390-400/t fob – up from $390-395/t fob last week.\\nKoch is expected to load around 5,000t of Togliatti ammonia from Sillamae next month, under an earlier purchase from Ameropa. The vessel has yet to be nominated but it is likely that further Baltic tonnage will be secured to load on the same vessel.\\nTurkey\\nTrammo has been awarded the Petkim tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery at a price of close to around $410/t cfr, suggesting a Yuzhny netback of around $380/t fob.

Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.\\n\"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not\\nchanged, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins,\" Mosaic chief executive Joc O\\'Rourke said.\\nThe company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. Prices for US DAP have been in decline since trading at $420/st fob Nola in late October because of lagging domestic and international demand. By late January, DAP prices hovered around $310/ st fob Nola — a 26pc drop and the lowest level since 2009. Since then the market has improved marginally, with trades last week at $315-$320/st fob Nola.\\nUS DAP export prices have also dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\n$380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.\\nMosaic\\'s phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as well.

The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013.\\nThe prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavor- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute.

Benchmark prices for Arabian Gulf granular have moved up to $310/t fob at the low end, but remain flat at the upper end, with $313/t fob the last done. Yuzhny prills have moved up to $298/t fob, but are lagging Chinese prices by $5-10/t.\\nCourtesy of an unusually strong domestic market and some injudicious short-selling by traders, Chinese producers are in the driving seat. Prilled urea prices have moved up to $303- 304/t fob China this week and asking prices are $310/t fob and above. Better returns are still obtainable from the local market and producers are sending little urea to the ports.\\nInventories of prilled urea at Chinese ports are estimated at less than 200,000t against about 500,000t that has to load in June to complete sales made to India and Pakistan. The implication is clear: prilled urea will continue to rise as trad- ers are obliged to pay up to cover their sales.\\nprICES\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nThis unusual erosion of the traditional price differential will effectively cap the increase in prilled urea as some buyers, for example India, can take either grade. But equally, it will provide a floor for international prices into July, because suppliers in the AG and elsewhere will refuse to sell at lower levels.\\nThe paper market is showing lower prices into July, based on the assumption that supply will eventually increase in China and that prices will fall back in the US during the summer months.\\nBut China has surprised everyone this year with its ability to hold onto price gains and may continue to do so.\\nHIGHLIGHTS\\n\\x84\\x84Chinese prilled prices rise above $300/t fob\\n\\x84\\x84TCP buys 100,000t of Chinese urea\\n\\x84\\x84Granular urea flat at $310-315/t fob AG and China\\n\\x84\\x84Sorfert plant may restart next week\\n\\x84\\x84Brazilian stand-off on price continues\\n\\x84\\x84Kaltim urea sales tender scrapped\\n\\x84\\x84Yuzhny price moves up as NF buys 25,000t\\n\\x84\\x84US UAN selling at $205/st for summer fill\\nArgus FMB East Europe\\nFertilizer 2015\\n17-19 June | Prague\\nJoin 150+ companies at the only fertilizer networking event in eastern Europe.

This is due to the closure of its Cherkassy urea plant last week.\\nDreymoor purchased 30,000t of prilled urea from DniproAzot in the low-$290s/t fob last week prior to the announcement about Cherkassy. This week, Koch bought 5,000t of Yuzhny urea at $292/t fob from another trader for June shipment. Prior to this, Trammo purchased 10-15,000t of OPZ urea at $290/t fob for June.\\nThe Cherkassy closure will remove about 55,000t/month from Ukrainian urea supply, leaving DniproAzot, 60-70,000t/ month, and OPZ, 60,000t/month, as the only suppliers. NF Trading recently shipped 25,000t of urea to Turkey for its Vitagro operation, but was short for its Italian sales.\\nOPZ may have another 10-12,000t of prilled urea to sell for June.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nEurochem is sold out for June but is starting to discuss 25- 30,000t of granular for early-July shipment. Canadian buyers are also starting to check the market for granular urea for July arrival. It will load 2 x 10,000t of prilled urea in Tuapse in June on combination cargoes for the US.\\nBaltic\\nUrea prices are moving up. Netbacks from Brazil set the low end of the range this week in the mid-$280s/t fob, but one 3,000t parcel did sell late in the week at $300/t fob for June to a trader who was short. It is not clear whether this price is immediately repeatable. But producers are now indicating $300/t fob for the next sales.\\nAmeropa will load 10,000t of prilled urea in combination with 25,000t of AN in Riga and Klaipeda in early-June for Santos, Brazil. Helm is in the market for a vessel to load 12,000t of granular urea 20-30 June in Riga or Damietta for Hamilton, Canada.\\nKeytrade has fixed a tbn to load 27,000t of prilled urea prompt in Kotka for Beira at about $37.50/t.\\nKoch is in the freight market for a vessel to load 40,000t of prilled and granular urea in the Baltic for Brazil in June.\\nEurope\\nThe maize season in southern Europe has only another 10 days to run and it is now too late to bring in any further ves- sels of granular urea. Pricing has switched fully to forward offers for delivery in second half 2015, with only product already in the country able to sell at high prices for prompt.\\nFrance\\nForward offers of granular urea are in the range €302-307/t fca in Atlantic ports, equivalent to $300-305/t fob North Africa. Sales in Mediterranean ports are taking place at €4- 5/t less.\\nIssue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015\\nMiddle East Export Sales\\nGermany\\nFirmer international prices have supported urea levels in Germany, despite minimal trade. Indications for 2H 2015 de- livery have firmed to €305-310/t fca for granular and €290/t fca for prilled. This compares with indications around €285/t fca and €270/t fca respectively, two weeks ago.\\nSKW Piesteritz reports previously selling granular urea at around €300/t fca seaport and above for delivery July\\n2015-January 2016, but has since withdrawn offers and will list official prices later in June.\\nItaly\\nApplication on maize will end in mid-June and the demand for prompt delivery dates has pushed domestic urea prices higher. Yara is now fully booked for delivery through to mid-June. In addition, recent import cargoes from Egypt and Algeria have been priced at higher levels, also supporting a\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nrise in domestic urea prices.\\nSpot prices range €345-350/t fca big bags (equivalent to\\n€350-355/t fca 50kg bagged), up from €335-345/t fca big bags two weeks ago. This would equate to around $355-366/t cif port duty paid/free.\\nTurkey\\nKastamonu bought 4,000t under its 28 May tender for prilled urea at a price reflecting the low-$290s/t fob Yuzhny.\\nMiddle East\\nThere is no spot cargo left to sell for June from the AG producers. Indications for July are starting to emerge around $320/t fob. No markets are paying that level yet and the paper market has traded lower this week; July is bid at $287/t fob and offered at $295/t fob on FIS. But the strength of Chinese prices suggests that AG producers will not need to sell anywhere close to that level when they negotiate July cargoes later this month.\\nOman\\nSIUCI is indicating prices in the low-$320s/t fob for its next available urea cargo, which is for early-July loading.\\nRUSSIAN UREA SHIPMENTS MAY 2015\\nKuwait\\nPIC is said to be indicating $317-318/t fob against any inqui- ries for spot cargoes of granular urea.\\nAbu Dhabi\\nKeytrade will load 35,000t of granular urea in Ruwais 11-15 June for three ports south and eastern Australia.\\nIran\\nA trader has fixed a vessel to load 30,000t of granular urea for Thailand prompt at $12-13/t.\\nAfrica\\nAlgeria\\nThe Sorfert urea plant remains down following the break- down on 17 May.

Traders are nomi- nating vessels mainly for Brazil at present.\\nEgypt\\nUrea production rates remain severely curtailed by the lack of natural gas. By press time, only EFC was operating out of the main urea exporters. However, it was only running one of its 55,000t/month lines at inconsistent rates. OFT is taking product to cover for the force majeure at Sorfert. One 7,000t sale is reported to the UK netting to $320/t fob Damietta.\\nAlexfert remains down this week with no restart set. Mopco was operating at around 1,200t/day early in the week, before going down again on 4 June. Its new 650,000t/year line was now expected to start-up in July, assuming there is sufficient gas supply.\\nHFC was also understood to have shut down on 4 June, although this could not be confirmed directly.\\nLibya\\nYara will load 18-19,000t of prilled urea in Marsa el Brega\\n4-8 June for Lome, Togo, and Douala, Cameroon, on a vessel\\nfixed at $27/t.\\nSouth Africa\\nUrea imports were down 36pc in the first four months of 2015 at 99,000t, with imports in April amounting to just 25,000t and comprising only one full cargo from Qatar. Im- ports have picked up in May and will be large in June, given the number of cargoes booked from the AG.\\nAsia\\nPakistan\\nTSP tendered on 29 May and 1 June for 50,000t of urea. It made awards as follows:\\n\\x84\\x8429 May tender – Dreymoor 50,000t at $318.63/t cfr Kara- chi\\n\\x84\\x841 June tender – Samsung 50,000t at $318.53/t cfr\\nBoth companies are expected to ship from China. The prices are estimated to netback in the high-$290s/t fob after allow- ing for freight of $16-17/t from north China plus other costs.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nTCP reduced the guaranteed discharge rate for the second tender to from 3,500t/day to 2,000t/day, which would in- crease the freight cost.\\nTCP is expected to tender for a further 150,000t of urea in early July for the summer crop.\\nLatest estimates from NFDC for the kharif (April-September) season include this quantity, with the 250,000t to be bought by TCP added to the 91,000t delivered in April-May by Sabic:\\nPakistan: urea balance sheet kharif 2015 - 000t\\nChina\\nThe available quantities of prilled urea are being snapped up at Chinese ports, with $303-304/t fob paid early in the week for small quantities but producers asking $310-312/t fob for larger cargoes. Producers are railing very little prilled urea to the ports and there is active demand from traders who sold to India and, since the weekend, Pakistan.\\nWhile the 100,000t needed for Pakistan may have been cov- ered, traders are reckoned to have 5 cargoes still to buy for India, equivalent to around 300,000t.\\nDreymoor has been in the market for a geared vessel to load 55-65,000t of urea in north China for India-Pakistan range 10-13 June. Samsung is in the freight market for a vessels to load either 50,000t or 2 x 25,000t of urea in Longkou, Jinzhou or Yantai for Pakistan end-June or early-July, basis 2,500t/day discharge.\\nDomestic market prices rose last week and producers are taking a very strong stance on pricing before they agree to move more urea for export. With another Indian tender likely in June and the summer season due to start in July, this stance is unlikely to change.\\nStocks in Chinese ports are less than 200,000t of prills and the unsold quantity is believed to be below 100,000t, spread across all ports.\\nGranular urea supply is easier and prices are not moving up. In fact, the granular market appears to have peaked and the differential with prills is narrowing. Asking prices are $313-314/t fob for June. Gavilon has bought 2 x 25,000t of granular urea at $311-313/t fob. China BlueChem is reported to have sold one Fudao granular urea cargo of about 25,000t from its June availability in the mid-$310s/t fob.\\nLiven is loading 60,000t of prilled urea in Qinhuangdao at present for IPL/India. Trammo has fixed a combination cargo of 60,000t of granular urea, amsul and kieserite loading in Bayuquan and Yantai in second half May for Nola and Tampa at $17/t.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nIndia\\nTraders have so far nominated vessels to load about 400,000t to IPL out of awards totalling 775,000t under its 9 May tender, as follows:\\n\\x84\\x84Global, m/v JK Monowara loaded 31,160t in Iran showing eta Kandla 4 June\\n\\x84\\x84Transagri, m/v Kiazand loaded 31,480t in Iran and show- ing eta Kandla 6 June\\n\\x84\\x84Liven, m/v BBG Endeavour 60,000t loading in China for Krishnapatnam\\n\\x84\\x84Transagri, m/v Ince Anadolu 50,000t loading in Iran for Pipavav\\n\\x84\\x84Swiss Singapore, m/v Ninjo Whale 60,000t loading in China for Pipavav\\n\\x84\\x84Aries, m/v Navios Seliayes loading 55,000t in China for Vizag\\n\\x84\\x84Samsung, m/v Okyalos loading 60,000t in China for Krish- napatnam\\n\\x84\\x84Transmart, m/v Hamgam loading 50,000t in Iran for Krish- napatnam\\nThe monsoon was on track to hit southern India 4-5 June, about four days later than forecast. The latest forecast from the Indian Meteorological Department is for the monsoon to be only 88pc of normal, categorized as deficient. It should be noted that the 2014 monsoon was also below average but urea sales still rose in the 2014-15 fertilizer year.\\nIndonesia\\nKaltim held a sales tender on 3 June for 2 x 30,000t of granular urea for latest shipment from Bontang by the end of June. It set a reserve price of $325/t fob but the highest bid it received was $302/t fob from CHS. Kaltim scrapped the tender. Traders subsequently bid $311-312/t fob to Kaltim outside the tender, but no sales are reported.\\nThailand\\nPrices for non-Chinese granular urea are around $320/t cfr, moving up slowly in response to higher fob levels from the AG and Indonesia.\\nUrea imports recovered to 207,000t in April, similar to the\\n200,000t imported in April 2014, according to data from Thai Customs, but overall imports for the first four months of 2015 were down 15pc year-on-year. January-April imports were 550,000t in 2015; Sabic supplied 251,000t, Petronas 97,000t and Muntajat 87,000t of this.\\nSouth Korea\\nNamhae tendered on 3 June for 6,000t of granular urea for 21-25 June delivery to Kwangyang. It bought the cargo at a price equivalent to $305-310/t fob China.\\nPungnong tendered on 4 June for 6,000t of prilled urea for June shipment. It awarded the tender to a trader at $314/t cfr, netting to the high-$290s/t fob China.\\nAustralia\\nDry weather and concerns about water supply for the 2015 crop mean that there is little further demand for spot urea cargoes for Australia in June. Several cargoes are being shipped at present from the AG and Indonesia, which are judged sufficient to cover demand for June and July arrival.\\nAmericas\\nUS\\nThe US urea market was largely unchanged this week, still covering a wide range but with most loading windows trad- ing at similar values to last week. The main exception was loaded barges, which declined about $8/st following the last day of May. Suppliers continue to buy barges to replenish warehouses for corn top dress, the window for which has been extended by cool weather preventing the crop from getting too tall. Rice demand in the southeast will also pick up later this month and continue in July. For now stable but lower consumption and the slower pace of imports seem well matched.\\nTrades for loading within 30 days concluded in the range of $319-355/st fob Nola, nearly unchanged from $320-358/st fob Nola last week. The high end was set by loaded barges traded early in the assessment window, while the low end references a trade for June loading. This week last year the assessment was $300-342/st fob Nola, which precluded a rally to near $400/st with the market undersupplied for late- season demand including rice. Rice demand will be lower this year, however, due to the reduction in plantings.\\nUrea imports down in April\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nImports of urea into the US fell by 34pc in April to 631,000t, in reaction to declining prices and the perception that the market was already well-supplied. Overall imports July\\n2014-April 2015 were 6.56m tonnes, up from 5.99m tonnes in the same period of 2013-14.\\nMexico\\nIsaosa tendered this week for 25,000t of granular urea for June shipment to the west coast. Samsung is reported to have taken the business in the mid-$330s/t cfr, netting to about $313/t fob China.\\nBrazil\\nThe stand-off on price has continued for another week. Granular urea importers have upped their bids to $320/t cfr. Offers remain close to $330/t cfr but no spot business is reported this week. Paper market trades have taken place at $323 and $324/t cfr for June, perhaps indicating where prices will settle. One sale of prilled urea is reported at $308/t cfr for June.\\nChile\\nCHS has sold 25,000t of Chinese granular for first half July shipment to Chile in combination with 5,000t each of MAP and GTSP. The price reflects about $310/t fob north China.\\nUruguay/Argentina\\nAmeropa has sold 20,000t of granular urea to several buy- ers from an AG cargo that is said to be floating. Isusa had a prompt requirement for 10,000t and is reported to have paid $338/t cfr. Nidera also bought 4-5,000t.\\nIn Argentina, Nidera is in the market for 15,000t of granular urea for June shipment.\\nAmmonium Sulphate/Nitrate\\nTurkey\\nGubretas is receiving 20-25,000t of capro grade amsul from OCI in June at $170/t cfr under a deal agreed two months ago. A second 20-25,000t cargo will be shipped from Ant- werp in July.\\nOtherwise, the market is quiet. Prices for Chinese amsul are too high to encourage any early buying.\\nThe extent to which Turkey has become reliant on Chinese amsul was highlighted in the statistics for March imports. China supplied three-quarters of the 100,000t imported in\\nMarch and in total shipped 191,000t in the first quarter. Tur- key imported 266,000t of amsul January-March, 45pc more than in the first quarter of 2014, suggesting that there has been some stock-building.\\nEgypt\\nOne sale of 3-5,000t of capro grade amsul is reported for June shipment from the Black Sea around $180/t cfr, ru- moured to be SBU product.\\nChina\\nAmsul prices remain very firm but are moving up only very slowly. Prices for capro grade amsul are a minimum of $132/t fob this week, while steel grade material is only $3-4/t lower.\\nIndagro is in the market for a vessel to load 30,000t of amsul in Qinhuangdao 4-6 June in combination with 27,000t of NPs for Brazil.\\nBrazil\\nPrice indications for capro grade standard amsul for June business were flat this week, with European and Chinese product pegged at $170/t and $160/t cfr Paranagua, respec- tively. Granular grade is on offer at $225-235/t cfr Parana- gua, depending on importers’ volume requirements, for both EU and US amsul.\\nRussian AN has sold at $225/t cfr this week, basis June shipment, reflecting the low-$200s/t fob Baltic port. Freight from the Baltic to Brazil is $20-23/t basis one port discharge.\\nMexico\\nThe market is short of amsul due to limited domestic pro- duction and the block on Chinese and US imports. European suppliers are sold out for June.\\nBlack Sea\\nSales of steel grade amsul have taken place this week at $136-138/t fob for Ukrainian origin and in the high-$120s/t fob for Russian (dutiable) product.\\nAmeropa has sold cargoes of AN to buyers in Albania and Morocco at prices netting below $205/t fob Black Sea. It will load 3-4,000t of Russian AN in June for Albania and 6-7,000t for Morocco.\\nEurochem reports selling 7,000t of AN to an African market, believed to be Mozambique, at a price netting to $225/t fob Novorossisk.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nGermany\\nFollowing on from Yara’s 26 May notice, OCI announced new season CAN 27 prices for Germany and Benelux markets ef- fective 1 June as follows: June €225/t cif inland; July €230/t cif inland; August €235/t cif inland. Last year, OCI’s initial pre-storage price for the new season was €230/t cif inland. Yara then subsequently announced its July price for Ger- many in line with OCI.\\nThe new season announcements came earlier than many anticipated and caught out some sellers still holding higher- priced inventory. Just ahead of the new season announce- ment, Russian CAN had been sold at €240/t fca seaport, but prices would now need to be adjusted downwards.\\nNonetheless, wholesalers, cooperatives and retailers are stepping in to book, aware that the new season price is traditionally the lowest of the campaign. An added incentive this year is the timing, as there is still demand for the pres- ent season for use on both crops and grassland.\\nIssue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015\\nnamely the southeast.\\nIn the import market, buyers are inquiring for UAN 32 for July but are finding offers at $235-236/t cfr for Russian material, up from $223/t cfr last done in the Gulf. The $205/ st fob Nola price now seen for summer fill is equivalent to $226/t and should set a base for imports. It is equivalent to about $185/t fob Black Sea.\\nArgentina/Uruguay\\nBunge is in the market for 25,000t of UAN 32 for July ship- ment to Argentina, bidding initially at $225/t cfr in line with prices achieved for June cargoes.

There are only 1-2 traders offering at that level, however. Other traders have put out offers at €200/t fca to indicate their intention to move prices higher during the second half.\\nThe m/t Yangon is due to arrive in La Pallice in the first half of June with 41,000t of UAN 32 from the US. Freight is reported fixed at about $1.2m lumpsum. This is the first of a rumoured two vessels sold by CF Industries to co-op buyers in France. The vessel will complete discharge in Rouen.\\nUS\\nThe US UAN market continues to transition from spring to summer fill buying, and transactions have been widely re- ported at $205/st fob Nola for June or July loading. Produc- ers have not published summer fill values, but some business has already concluded for that timeframe. Meanwhile, the market for prompt-loading tons is unclear, but still carries a premium to fill values.\\nCarryout from the ongoing spring season is expected to be modest overall, but there will be some regional pockets of excess supply where wet weather crimped applications—\\nEgypt\\nAbu Qir has told buyers that it has no interest in producing UAN at current price levels – around $180/t fob – and there is no news on when it may offer UAN again for export.\\nArgus Media Blog\\nhttp://blog.argusmedia.com\\nSubscribe to our blog for expert updates and analysis on the latest developments in the global oil industry\\nAnnouncement — email settings\\nArgus will soon change the email domain from which we send out reports to some subscribers.

It has a regasification capacity of 550mn ft³/d (5.7bn m³/yr).\\nEgypt has since made firm enquires for a second FSRU, which could be located at the same site as the first — Ain Sukhna, near the Suez Canal at Adabiya — or in the Mediterranean Sea.\\nThe contract for the design and supply of equipment for the granular urea unit was awarded to the Czech firm Chemo- projekt Nitrogen in August 2014. It will use Stamicarbon’s granulation technology.\\nEgypt takes sixth LNG cargo\\nThe 160,000m³ Cool Explorer is scheduled to arrive at the Egyptian port of Ain Sukhna on 3 June carrying a Qatari LNG cargo. This is the sixth cargo shipped since Egypt started to import LNG in April to mitigate the shortage of gas in the country.\\nSo far all the additional gas has gone to the power sector and there is little discernible increase in gas supply to pro- cess industries such as fertilizers.\\nThe vessel was chartered by trading firm Trafigura, accord- ing to shipping sources. Trafigura has agreed to supply 33 LNG cargoes to Egypt in 2015-16, while fellow trading firm Vitol will supply nine cargoes over two years from June. Noble Clean Fuels, a unit of Hong Kong-based commodities trading firm Noble Group, will provide seven cargoes over two years.

Apart from the US, which is operating in a paral- lel universe at present, sales are proving difficult in major markets. Buyers in Brazil appear to be gaining the upper hand after a prolonged stand-off and granular urea prices are weakening in Thailand as well.\\nNetbacks to the Middle East have eased to $302-310/t fob from these markets and Kaltim this week sold 90,000t to traders at $308/t fob when last week it was seeking over $320/t fob for the same product. Indications for granular urea from China are around $310/t fob, but no one is buying.\\nThe US market has risen again this week, desperate buyers paying the equivalent of $400/t cfr for loaded barges and, more significantly, the equivalent of $340/t cfr for first half July. As a result, the US is pulling spot cargoes away from other markets, notably Brazil, as traders try to profit from the strength of US prices.\\nprICES\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPrilled urea prices remain firm in China. Traders have paid\\n$303-308/t fob for upwards of 100,000t to cover Indian sales. Inventories are low at the main ports, forcing traders to load panamax vessels in two ports, and producers comfortable.\\nFigures from India this week show that sales rose 845,000t in the April-May while stocks dropped by half, suggesting there is an urgent need to import more urea. Speculation is mounting that the next tender will be announced shortly and is widely appreciated among Chinese producers.\\nAssuming Chinese prilled urea prices remain above $300/t fob for July, there is limited downside to granular urea in the AG for the month. AG suppliers enjoy a small freight advantage over China in shipments to India and any surplus urea could be sold there at netbacks above $300/t fob.\\nHighlights\\n\\x84\\x84Chinese prices peak but export supply remains low\\n\\x84\\x84Granular urea market turns bearish outside the US\\n\\x84\\x84Indian urea sales surge in May, stocks drop 50pc\\n\\x84\\x84Kaltim sells 90,000t of gran urea at $308 fob\\n\\x84\\x84Traders divert Brazilian cargoes to the US\\n\\x84\\x84Iranian spot cargo placed in Turkey\\n\\x84\\x84OCI to load Egyptian cargo for the US\\n\\x84\\x84Yara raises nitrates prices in France\\nUrea\\nBlack Sea\\nDniproAzot and OPZ are largely committed for June and are quoting $295-300/t fob for any remaining tonnage. Latest sales in Turkey reflect the low-$290s/t fob Yuzhny but are based on old positions. The 25,000t of prilled urea sold to NF last week at $298/t fob remains the highest-priced deal this month.\\nThere is demand for prilled urea from Morocco, Spain and Italy for July, which should enable Ukrainian suppliers to maintain prices given the limited production in the country.\\nSalavat held a sales tender on 9 June and sold 5,500t of prilled urea to Avestra Chemicals for shipment via Tuapse.\\nTuapse line-up June 2015\\nEurochem is negotiating prilled urea for July loading in Tua- pse but has not yet agreed any new business. Price ideas are around $295/t fob.\\nBaltic\\nUralchem sold 20,000t of prilled urea to Mexico on 10 June at a price netting to the high-$280s/t fob Baltic. No other large sales are reported this week. Uralchem has mainte- nance planned at one of its urea plants starting at the end- June/early July, with another plant scheduled to go down at a later, unspecified date.\\nTrammo has fixed a tbn at $33-34/t to load 35,000t of Phosa- gro prilled urea 13-15 June in Kotka for four ports Peru.\\nKoch is loading 40,000t of prilled and granular urea in Kotka and Riga at present on a vessel fixed at $23-24/t for dis- charge in Santos and Paranagua, Brazil.\\nEurope\\nTurkey\\nToros has bought 15,000t of Iranian granular urea from a trader at $316/t cfr with 180 days for prompt shipment. The balance of a 30,000t floating cargo is being offered in southern Turkey.\\nAn industrial buyer has purchased 3,000t of prilled urea from Ameropa at a price netting to $291/t fob Yuzhny.\\nFrance\\nInterest in forward sales remains, but price ideas from major buyers are low – reflecting $280-285/t fob North Africa. The most recent sales took place at $320-325/t cfr equivalent last week, but would be difficult to repeat this week.\\nMiddle East\\nOne new spot sale has been reported this week at $310/t fob\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nfor first half July shipment. The non-US price range has been assessed at $300-310/t fob, based on netbacks from key mar- kets at the lower end of the range.\\nJune tonnage remains in the hands of some traders and still to be sold, with buyers in both Thailand and Brazil proving resistant to the latest offers. Producers are sold out for June and have a large line up of contract shipments for July, with the US prominent. We estimate that 2-3 spot cargoes are available for July, totalling 70-100,000t.\\nOman\\nSIUCI is reported to have sold 30-35,000t of granular urea at $310/t fob for first half July loading. Keytrade is check- ing freight options for 35-40,000t of granular urea to load prompt in Sohar for Brazil, Mississippi River or Thailand.\\nFertil\\nChecks on the jetty used to load urea in Ruwais have been completed and restrictions on vessel size have been relaxed. Fertil is now able to load vessels of 40,000t and above.\\nAfrica\\nAlgeria\\nUrea production restarted on 6 June at Sorfert\\'s complex at Arzew, according to customers who have been notified by the Algerian company. The urea plant and accompanying ammonia unit had been down since 17 May.\\nHelm will load 3,000t of granular urea on the m/v Cedeira on 11 May for Spain. The larger quantities sold to other buy- ers will take some time to amass. Indagro has nominated the m/v Servet Ana to load 27,500t for the Americas and Nitron 14,000t on the m/v Franziska Bolten and 6,000t on the m/v Arne, all during June.\\nAmeropa completed loading 30,000t of granular urea from the AOA plant at the start of this week. The vessel is going to a destination in the Americas. AOA has stopped produc- tion now to make adjustments to the unit as part of the commissioning process and the schedule for loadings during June has not been finalised.\\nEgypt\\nOCI will load 25,000t of granular urea in the coming week\\nMiddle East Export Sales\\nfor the US. The price has not been confirmed but is believed to be $312-313/t fob.\\nThe inconsistency of domestic urea production shows no signs of abating, despite the recent LNG imports aimed at easing the domestic gas supply shortage.\\nEFC went down at the start of the week and Mopco remains down. Helwan is also understood to be down, although this\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\ncould not be directly confirmed.\\nAlexfert restarted production at the beginning of the week and is operating at 75-80pc rates (around 41-44,000t/month). Alexfert is delivering all its urea to the domestic market.\\nMorocco\\nBuyers are in the market for 8-10,000t of prilled urea for June shipment.\\nAsia\\nTraders have sold small lots from old positions at $305/t fob netbacks; while the higher end is quoted for larger quanti- ties. Due to low inventories, traders are having to load panamax cargoes in two ports. Inventories at Chinese ports are estimated at only 400,000t.\\nPressure is mounting more on granular urea as supply to the ports is increasing. Suppliers are still asking $310-315/t fob for inventories in ports but no one will pay that today. Gran- ular urea prices appear set to converge with prills in the next 10-15 days, at which point either support may emerge from buyers who can take granular for India, or granular may pull down the prilled urea price.\\nChina\\nPrices appear to have peaked. Buyers are expecting lower prices because they doubt there is sufficient demand to come from the domestic market to maintain prices for July- August, but producers are content to sit and wait for busi- ness to come to them, unwilling to cut prices for now.\\nPrilled urea prices are supported by sales for India. Samsung is rumoured to have bought about 100-150,000t to cover sales to India and Pakistan and producers believe there are 160-180,000t of urea still to be covered for India; Agricom, Gavilon and ETA have still to nominate vessels for IPL.\\nLatest prices for prills are in the range $303-308/t fob.\\nnitrogen this week\\nAmeropa is in the freight market for 25,000t of granular urea to load in Basuo for Chile in June. It purchased the cargo from China BlueChem last week at $315-316/t fob. It will also load 35,000t of granular urea in north China in June. China BlueChem has a second half June Fudao cargo to sell but may decide to move the cargo to the domestic market if international prices slip.\\nIndia\\nVessel nominations under IPL’s 9 May tender have risen to just under 600,000t out of 775,000t awarded. Three sup- pliers – Agricom, Gavilon and ETA – have still to nominate vessels from China.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nThere is no firm indication when India will tender next for urea, although speculation is already rife that one will be issued shortly. The sales and stocks figures for May shown below do imply that there is an urgent need to import more urea for the kharif season.\\nSales rise, stocks fall in May\\nPreliminary figures for urea sales in India for the month of May show an increase of 304,000t, or 14pc, on May 2014 to 2.472m tonnes.\\nThis follows an increase of 541,000t in April and means that sales are up 845,000t in the first two months of the year.\\nAs a result, stocks are estimated to have fallen to 425,000t at the end of the month, compared to 836,000t at the end of May 2014.\\nNaphtha supply extended to urea plants\\nThe three naphtha-based ammonia/urea plants in southern India have had supply extended for another three months to enable continued production, the government said this week.\\nFertilizer minister Ananth Kumar said on Wednesday: “The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the continuation of production of urea from Madras Fertiliz- ers, Manali, Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mangalore, and Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation, Tutico- rin, using naphtha as feedstock”.\\nThe three plants have a combined capacity to make 1.5m tonnes/year of urea. Naphtha supply is being maintained to prevent a shortage of urea in the south until such time as the plants can be connected to gas supply.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nIPL urea tender 9 May - vessel nominations\\n60$347.26/t cfr with 270 days\\' credit.\\n60Dreymoor made the lowest offer for 18,000t of prilled urea\\n60at $343.53/t cfr with 180 days.\\n31These prices are estimated to net back to around $290/t fob\\n60China after allowing for freight, financing, margin and other\\n50\\n31 costs.

Offers should be on a cif Nepal basis for delivery to AICL warehouses and valid for 21 days. Delivery of the urea should be within 90-110 days after l/c opening.\\nSouth Korea\\nDongbu tendered this week for 4,000t of granular urea and is reported to have bought at Chinese cargo at a price net- ting to $305/t fob.\\nUnder its 4 June tender, Pungnong purchased 5-6,000t of prilled urea from LG International at $313/t cfr, reflecting around $297/t fob China.\\nIndonesia\\nKaltim sold a total of 90,000t granular urea this week through private negotiations at a common price of $308/t fob for June/early-July loading in Bontang. The price is $3-4/t lower than in Kaltim’s previous sale. Sales were as follows:\\n\\x84\\x84CHS 30,000t \\x84\\x84Daewoo 6,000t \\x84\\x84Koch 40,000t\\n\\x84\\x84Samsung 20,000t\\nCHS and Samsung are expected load vessels for Central America. Koch is rumoured to be shipping 10,000t to Thai- land. Daewoo is covering a sale in Vietnam.\\nThailand\\nOffer prices for granular urea are retreating in the face of indifference from buyers. Prices have fallen by about $5/t to the range $315-320/t cfr this week, with importers seeing the purchases in Indonesia at $308/t fob as evidence of a weakening market. Buyers are bidding at $310/t cfr for the next cargoes.\\nThe 30,000t Iranian granular urea cargo sold to 2-3 buyers at $305/t cfr during May has been cancelled due to payment problems and the cargo sold in Turkey/southern Europe instead.\\nVietnam\\nDaewoo is reported to have sold 6,000t of Indonesian granu- lar urea for June shipment.\\nAmericas\\nUS\\nRice and corn top-dress application demand fuelled a rally in US urea prices this week. Barges have traded at the equiva- lent of $335-342/t cfr for first half July and the US is pulling in spot vessels, particularly those originally intended for Brazil. New vessels for the US include:\\n\\x84\\x84Ameropa/Kuwait 35,000t diverted from Brazil\\n\\x84\\x84Koch/Oman 35,000t June vessel declared for the US\\n\\x84\\x84OCI/Egypt 25,000t loading week commencing 15 June\\n\\x84\\x84Indagro/Algeria 27,500t confirmed for second half June\\nThe strength of US prices and liquidity in Nola mean that there will be a large line up of vessels to load in July also.\\nJuly prices are eclipsed by those for prompt/loaded barges, however, which have traded as high as $370/st fob Nola, up by $15/st from the high end of last week’s assessment. Barges for loading in first-half July traded at $309-315/st fob Nola, compared to trades for that loading window at $305/ st last week. Prices for June-loading barges surged from an early-week low of $329/st fob Nola to $355/st fob.\\nThe high end of this week’s $309-370/st fob Nola range represents the highest mark for the assessment since August 2014 and marks a $94/st rise over the last two months. The\\nUS vessel arrivals of granular urea 2014-15\\nwide assessment range is due to the sharp drop in forward values. But rice demand is expected to keep prompt values supported at least through June, particularly with delays along the Arkansas River crimping stocks in that key distribu- tion hub.\\nMexico\\nThe buying group held a tender on 10 June for 20,000t of prilled urea and 5,000t of SAN for first half July shipment to the east coast. Uralchem took the award. Prices are reported in the high-$280s/t fob for the prilled urea and\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n$235-240/t fob for the SAN.\\nBrazil\\nSales of granular urea are taking place under price formulas but there is a lack of fixed price business with which to as- sess the market.\\nFirm offers for June granular urea from the Middle East were in the $330-335/t cfr range earlier in the week for deliveries at Paranagua, Sao Francisco or Rio Grande against bids at $320/t cfr Paranagua and $325/t cfr Itaqui.\\nBy midweek offers were adjusted down to $325/t cfr Rio Grande but yielded no new business. Bids were in the range $310-315/t cfr.\\nThere is an overall perception among buyers that prices for granular urea will fall below the $310/t cfr mark in the sec- ond half of June, as more tonnes become available. Traders are doing their best to avoid overloading the market.\\nAmeropa has diverted a 40,000t Kuwaiti granular urea vessel to the US due to slow market conditions in Brazil. The cargo loaded in Kuwait in May and is floating. It is now reported that only three Qatari cargoes will load for Brazil in June rather than five. Traders are also re-assessing whether to ship more Algerian urea to Brazil.\\nA part-cargo of 10,000t of Russian prilled urea for June ship- ment has reportedly traded at $305-310/t cfr Santos, with an additional 5,000t at $310-315/t cfr for delivery at Recife. The vessel totalling 30,000t includes around 20,000t of AN.\\nUrea imports down one third January-May\\nImports of urea fell by 33pc year-on-year in the first five months of 2015, a drop of more than 500,000t. Overall im- ports were 1.025m tonnes down from 1.55m tonnes January- May 2014. May imports were 179,000t, compared to 370,000t in May 2014.\\nImports are forecast to fall back from last year’s record total of 4.4m tonnes due to the weaker real that has pushed up prices for imported fertilizers and poor outlook for crop prices. But the drop in imports in the first half of 2015 is larger than anticipated and may this trend may continue into the second half of 2015, given the resistance from urea buyers seen since mid-May.\\nPeru\\nTrammo has fixed a vessel to load 35,000t of prilled urea\\n13-15 June in Kotka for four port discharge. It sold the urea to Yara in May.\\nChile\\nAmeropa is in the freight market for a vessel to load 35,000t of urea in Qinhuangdao, China, for 2-3 ports in Chile 10-15 June and 25,000t from Basuo. CHS will also load 25,000t\\nof Chinese granular urea for Chile in June. Buyers are now checking prices for July shipments.\\nAmmonium Sulphate/Nitrate\\nMexico\\nFurther to last week’s report, Mexican ammonium sulphate producers have contacted us to say that the market is not short and that they have sufficient production and inventory to cover market needs for the coming season. One said that it had nearly two months’ production in store in its ware- houses ready to meet buyers’ requirements.\\nANIQ, the Mexican producers\\' association, said: \"national production and existing inventories fully guarantee total domestic consumption for this agricultural season.\"\\nThe four Mexican producers, Agrogen, Fertiquim, Fertirey and Univex, have a combined capacity to produce nearly 1.9m tonnes/year of ammonium sulphate, whereas the mar- ket is about 1.6m tonnes annually.\\nImports from the US and China, which supplied about 350,000t in 2014, have been blocked since March by a provi- sional anti-dumping duty. A final determination on the case is expected later this month following a public hearing.\\nIn April, an incident at one of Pemex’ facilities led it declare force majeure on some ammonia. Some domestic receiv- ers have been on allocation since then, but gas supply to another ammonia unit should be restored around 14 June increasing supply.\\nBrazil\\nOffer prices for European and US capro grade standard amsul for June shipment have moved up to $175/t cfr Paranagua and OCI is indicating $185/t cfr for July shipment/August arrival. The move follows sales of Chinese capro grade amsul for June loading in the mid-$160s/t cfr Rio Grande. One 25,000t vessel has sold at that level and smaller parcels have been sold in other ports.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nGranular amsul prices have also moved up, with some small lots of European and US product reported at $235/t cfr Para- nagua for July shipment.\\nRussian ammonium nitrate for June shipment is on offer at $230/t cfr Paranagua from Fitco and others. One sale is reported at that level.\\nTurkey\\nOCI loaded 25,000t of amsul in Antwerp this week for Aliaga and Tekirdag on a vessel fixed at $18.25/t.\\nRussia\\nOne producer sold 4,000t of steel grade amsul to a trader in early June at a price equivalent to $123-124/t fob Kherson. A 2,500t parcel of Russian steel grade amsul was sold via Novorossisk at $118-120/t fob equivalent.\\nOCI and Borealis in France but the increase will change that.\\nLithuania\\nAchema has sold around 30,000t of AN to its usual custom- ers for September shipment to the UK and France. The price is €5/t higher than for August at close to €250/t fob in big bags.\\nRussia\\nVertiqal is in the market for a vessel to load 11-12,000t of bagged AN in Novorossisk in the first half of July for Beira, Mozambique.\\nEurochem will load 10,000t of AN in combination with 25,000t of granular urea in the Black Sea in July for the US Gulf. It is reporting a sale of 10,000t of AN to an African market at $220/t fob bulk for early-July shipment.\\nChina\\nSinopec sold 6,000t of capro grade amsul to Koch late last week at $133/t fob for end-June loading. Koch is being quoted up to $138/t fob for another 4,000t to complete the cargo. Luxi is reported to have sold 3,000t to another buyer at $136/t fob for June. The market remains tight for June and early-July, although some additional supply could emerge in July when factories complete there maintenance turnarounds.\\nTraders are selling parcels of capro grade in Brazil at $165/t cfr, netting back in the mid-$130s/t fob China from floating cargoes. Southeast Asian markets are paying up only slowly, however, with the sale this week in Thailand netting below current market levels.\\nSteel grade prices have fallen slightly this week, with good quality material offered at $128-129/t fob.\\nThailand\\nTCCC has bought 10,000t of capro grade amsul from a trader in the low-$150s/t cfr for June shipment, freight from China is estimated at $20/t.\\nFrance\\nYara raised its AN 33.5 and CAN 27 prices by €7/t on 10 June with immediate effect. The new official prices are €292/t and €237/t cpt bulk respectively. This is a relatively large monthly step up and suggests that uptake from distributors has been good at the new season starting price of €285/t cpt for AN. Yara’s CAN price was €2-3/t lower than those from\\nUkraine\\nOstchem has announced that it may start to produce AN again at its Cherkassy plant based on bought in ammonia so that it can supply the Ukrainian market with the product needed in the autumn. With Russian blocked by an anti- dumping duty, NF has a crucial position in supplying AN to Ukrainian farmers.\\nMorocco\\nEurochem has sold 10,000t of AN via LDC to buyers in Mo- rocco at a reported price of $243/t cfr bulk. Freight from the Black Sea is estimated in the high-$20s/t.\\nUAN Solutions\\nUS\\nFollowing import business as low as $216/t cfr and prelimi- nary fill business as low as $205/st fob Nola in recent weeks, the US UAN market has stabilized and prices for summer delivery have moved higher. However, with side dress ap- plications winding down in the Corn Belt there is little if any demand for prompt tons from Nola. Prevailing prices have now transitioned from in-season to fill values.\\nOffers for June and July loading UAN at Nola are now in the range of $210-215/st fob Nola. Meanwhile, Eurochem has sold 30-33,000t of UAN 32 at $235/t cfr for late-July/early- August arrival to two ports on the east coast. Agronova is in the market for a vessel to load 40,000t of UAN 32 in the first half of July for the US east coast. Price indications are\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\n$235-236/t cfr.\\nConsensus among traders is that CF will announce its sum- mer fill programme over the coming weeks at about $215/st fob Nola, although there is a wide range of opinions on the price. Last year’s fill price was issued in mid-June at $235- 240/st fob Nola.\\nIn the export market, Nitron has purchased two parcels totalling about 50,000t of UAN 32 from CF for June-July shipment to Argentina and Uruguay.

An estimated 600-700,000t of UAN have been sold for delivery up to December, ahead of the same time last year, so there is no need for buyers to step in.\\nIssue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015\\nAnnouncement — email settings\\nArgus will soon change the email domain from which we send out reports to some subscribers.

As a result the market has entered a hiatus, wait- ing for direction from Indian offers. Prices have seen little movement but the market has adopted a distinctly firmer tone on the back of prospective Indian demand. There is sentiment that given a recovery in the monsoon and low stocks, Indian demand under this tender is substantial at around 1mn t. Moreover, awards totalling 175,000t have still to receive vessel nominations under the last tender. This could lend support to Chinese, Yuzhny and the Arab Gulf given that the cargoes have to be shipped by 27 July.\\nThe key question is at what price. Availability out of China remains a key discussion point for India. But it seems pretty clear that with Iranian supply estimated at 150,000-160,000t for India in July, plus 2-3 AG cargoes at most, there seems to be little sign of Chinese resolve weakening on prices - in fact just the opposite. However, the concern is that some short offers will be aggressive into India. Even if the ability to get backing at low numbers proves to be be extremely difficult, India\\'s ability to secure tonnage at lower prices means it may not source all it needs. This raises the spectre of additional tenders heading into Q3.\\nChinese port stocks remain relatively low at just over 400,000t and the domestic market will be active into July,\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nprICES\\n*Composite based on Argus FMB assessments for a basket of nitrogen-based fertilizers.

With port stocks low and few trader longs evident, fresh tonnage needs 2-3 weeks to move from the factories to the ports. The expectation is that China will provide at least 500,000-600,000t urea in the tender, providing some short term support to prices.\\nIn terms of actual trade, there was limited activity this week. Ballance New Zealand issued a snap tender for granu- lar urea while TFC Taiwan awarded a small prilled tender in the mid-$310s/t cfr. Korea will tender on 19 June for a small lot of prills. In Sri Lanka, Dreymoor is understood to have been awarded under the last tender and a new tender has reportedly been announced.\\nLooking forward, the market appears to be stable-to-firm on the basis of Indian demand. However, it is India\\'s ability to source at prices acceptable to suppliers that will be key to how the market develops in early Q3.\\nHighlights\\n\\x84\\x84Chinese prills offers rise on Indian tender...\\n\\x84\\x84...which calls for shipment by 27 July\\n\\x84\\x84160,000t Iranian urea available for India\\n\\x84\\x84AOA Algeria plant still down\\n\\x84\\x84Egyptian urea production improves\\n\\x84\\x84Ballance New Zealand tenders for granular urea\\n\\x84\\x84TFC Taiwan tender awarded in mid-$310s/t cfr\\n\\x84\\x84Korea tenders for 6,000t prills\\n\\x84\\x84Sri Lanka awards Dreymoor - new tender announced\\nArgus Media Blog\\nhttp://blog.argusmedia.com\\nSubscribe to our blog for expert updates and analysis on the latest developments in the global oil industry\\nIssue 15-24 | Thursday 18 June 2015\\nTuapse line-up June 2015\\nUrea\\nBlack Sea\\nEuroChem is targeting $305-310/t fob for July shipment for granular and $295-300/t fob for prills.

The last business remains UralChem\\'s sale of 20,000t of prills to Mexico in the high-$280s/t fob Baltic. Asking prices for prills are reported around $298/t fob for small lots. Traders believe sub-$290/t fob is possible for early July loaders of 20-25,000t.\\nEurope\\nGermany\\nYara’s ammonia unit in Brunsbüttel suffered a fire on 10 June. There were no casualties or serious injuries and dam- age to the plant was minimal, Yara said. The 750,000t/yr ammonia unit and consequently the 620,000t/yr prilled urea unit remains down and preparations for restart are ongo- ing. Demand for urea is seasonally low and no impact on the market has been noted.\\nFrance\\nThe French urea market is very much at the tail end of the season with just a few small lots selling for direct applica- tion on corn. The force majeure at Sorfert in Algeria delayed at least one 5,000t cargo and buyers seeking prompt spot volumes this week were forced to pay up to €350/t fca La Pallice.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nThe focus has shift to the forward market for delivery throughout the second half of the year. Offers have risen to €305-306/t fca La Pallice. Buyers are, however, seeking to buy €300/t fca or just below and are therefore holding off on committing for the time being.\\nA trader is rumoured to have sold some 10-15,000t of granu- lar urea at $295/t fob, the equivalent of between €297-303/t fca La Pallice.\\nBelgium\\nInterest in urea for the Belgium market is extremely low. New season granular urea is offered at around €300/t fca ARA ports for July-January delivery. There is, however, no demand as buyers are still targeting lower prices of around €285-290/t fca that were available earlier in the season.\\nSpain\\nThere is minimal remaining demand for urea and the focus now is on liquidating existing stocks, prompting a softening of prices. Fertiberia is priced at €315-320/t fca, but prilled urea is also available as low as €310/t fca in some regions.\\nIn the south, Via Fertysem is offering granular urea at around €330/t fca, but prices as low as €320/t fca are also available in parts of the country.\\nTurkey\\nAn inquiry from Yildez was circulating at presstime for 3,000t of urea.\\nNF reports to be selling out of stocks in Turkey with the domestic market showing a return of $295/t fob equivalent.

A combi- nation of healthy demand anticipated in India and a late do- mestic season are seeing producers take a firm stance. With freight at around $11/t for a panamax, this would equate to offers in India in the mid-$320s/t cfr.\\nIn latest business, Fertisul is loading 4,000t of granular urea to Vietnam on the m/v Hoang Phuong. The business was done late last week.\\nFertisul is also loading 10,000t granular urea to Namhae under the last tender on the m/v Hao Fan 6.\\nAs of Thursday, 18 June, port inventories were estimated by some sources at around 560,000t at Chinese ports, including 300,000t at Yantai port.

The Nola urea assessment moved to $305-380/st fob Nola, with loaded barge prices representing the high end. The low end is set based on late-week offers for first-half July loading that were met with minimum buying interest. July bids were scarce this week as traders retreated to assess a growing number of imports (totaling at least 260,000t) next month, many of which will arrive after peak demand.\\nThe high end of the Nola urea assessment reached its high- est point since 17 July 2014.\\nCF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.\\nDebottleneck work at Courtright\\'s existing urea plant will begin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quar- ter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Cour- tright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.\\nThe expansion will increase CF\\'s ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.\\nThe Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF\\'s nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF\\'s annual report.\\nBrazil\\nTonnage is mostly moving on formula hence spot activity is limited. Granular urea is being offered in a $320-325/t cfr range but bids are reportedly lower at sub-$320/t cfr basis some trader length still evident.

The country\\'s crop supply company Conab estimates that the 2014/15 second-crop corn harvest will reach 49.4mn t, a 2pc increase from the 2013/14 crop. Overall grain output is seen reaching 204.5mn t this season, up by 5.6pc.\\nLocal agricultural consultancy Agroconsult is projecting that the recent hike in interest rates for the farm sector could decrease soy-planted areas in the upcoming 2015/16 crop season.\\nAs a result, Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009, according to market estimates.

But these quantities are limited and so have not dis- rupted sales of the traditional suppliers at list levels.\\nFrance\\nAfter a strong start to the season, AN sellers, led by Yara have raised prices by around €7/t for next deliveries. Distrib- utors and farmers have accepted these prices which remain competitive when compared to year ago levels.\\nYara raised its AN 33.5 price to €292/t cpt bulk on 10 June, up from its new season start price of €285/t cpt bulk, with immediate effect. This relatively large, €7/t hike, suggests that uptake from distributors has been strong. Both Borealis and EuroChem are understood to be offering AN at simi- lar levels for July. Distributors fully expect further price increases in August and say that while demand from cereal farmers is strong the same cannot be said for grassland.\\nOffers of imported product from Lithuania and Poland have diminished as sellers are targeting more lucrative markets, such as the UK. Lithuanian producer Achema has an extend- ed turnaround at its plants July-September so is sold out. Spot market prices for AN were heard around €3/t firmer at between €272-275/t fca bagged.

Buyers have readily accepted Yara’s new CAN July delivery price of €237/t cpt bulk, up from its start price of €230/t cpt bulk. Buying has been strong, especially since Yara’s price was some €2-3/t lower than its competi- tors but the latest increase will change that.\\nOCI is sold out for June and July priced at €233/t cpt bulk and €238/t cpt bulk, respectively. The producer is also of- fering August delivery at €243/t cpt bulk but buyers are not booking material yet as they have time to wait.\\nBelgium\\nLack of rain has stopped CAN spreading and as a result sales at retail level have come to a halt. Demand in June, the first month of the new fertilizer year, was strong and most local suppliers are sold out. The bulk of the application season\\nis over in Benelux but buyers will continue to purchase for grassland applications which will finish in early August.\\nBuyers have fully accepted the €225/t cif inland level for June and July sales at €230/t have also taken place.\\nOCI also announced €235/t cif inland for August and reports good uptake at its offer to sell the quantities required for June-August, at an average price across the three months.\\nAnother 27,000t cargo of Ukrainian CAN is reported to have arrived in Ghent. This brings the total up to around 100,000t. An estimated 40-50,000t of CAN is in stock in Ghent selling at €210-215/t fca. Concerns with quality dete- rioration mean that distributors will not buy Ukrainian CAN to store.\\nSome 20-30,000t of Spanish/Fertiberia CAN is understood to have arrived in Ghent, Moerdijk and Brake over the past week or so.

It is reported to have been awarded at around €170/t fob (the low-$190s/t fob) with tonnes destined for France and the Ukraine.\\nFrance\\nDemand for prompt UAN is over and the focus is firmly on the forward market. Argus FMB estimates that between 30- 40% of the French UAN solutions market, which totals some 2.4 million t, has been covered so far.\\nUAN offer prices have pulled back from the latest sales done at around €198/t fca Rouen late last week to €196-197/t fca Rouen for second half 2015 delivery.

Traders started to cover short sales and some have taken long positions at the same time for February shipment.\\nConditions are very similar to those in October-November 2015, when prices rallied for 2-3 weeks, jumping $20/t in the process, and few expect this to be more than a temporary period of firmer prices. It may persist for longer, though, because it is coinciding with peak spring season demand in several countries.\\nBuyers, who have delayed their inquiries due to falling prices, are expected to purchase now, leading to a rush of demand in Latin America and elsewhere. Bids at $190/t cfr in Mexico and Turkey, which would have been entertained last week, will no longer find any takers.\\nShort covering in the Black Sea has seen prices pushed back up to $200-201/t fob Yuzhny from the low-$190s/t fob at the start of the week. Little urea remains unsold for February now.\\nprICES\\nCopyright © 2016 Argus Media group\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nBaltic urea traded up from $182/t fob to $188-192/t fob for February, while two Middle East cargoes were sold at $200/t fob.\\nChinese suppliers have not been in a mood to reduce prices further prior to the New Year break and one trader who needed 6,000t of prilled urea for February loading could find no sellers below $200/t fob. This contrasts with the short sales made early in the week in Asia at prices netting to $185-187/t fob for February.\\nThe US market is lending strength to urea. CF was reportedly out buying in barges of granular urea this week. Cfr levels in the US Gulf have firmed to $220-223/t, equivalent to $210- 213/t fob Middle East given current depressed freight rates.\\nWhile it is becoming late to load new cargoes for the US, traders are trying to work first half February loaders and the US provides a welcome alternative to Brazil for AG cargoes at present. There are few cargoes being offered to Brazilian buyers at present and prices these have moved up to $200- 205/t cfr.\\nThe only origin to see lower prices this week was Egypt, where sales were made at $215 and $218/t fob for February. Competition in European markets, which are slow for Febru- ary, from the Arabian Gulf is keeping a lid on prices there.\\nHIGHLIGHTS\\n\\x84\\x84Urea market reaches a temporary floor\\n\\x84\\x84Short covering firms prices in Baltic and Black Sea\\n\\x84\\x84Mexican group tender seen as test of the market\\n\\x84\\x84AG granular cargo sold for Europe\\n\\x84\\x84Mopco plant down for another two weeks\\n\\x84\\x84Brazilian prices firm as traders shun the market\\n\\x84\\x84US market strengthens\\n\\x84\\x84Chinese raise asking prices prior to holiday period\\n\\x84\\x84Amsul demand suffers from low urea prices\\n\\x84\\x84UAN cargoes sold in Argentina and Canada\\nTuapse line-up January-February 2016\\nUrea\\nBlack Sea\\nTraders have grabbed most of the available tonnage of urea left for February this week, paying prices between $192 and $201/t fob. The purchases are partly to cover short sales in Turkey and other Black Sea markets and also as long posi- tions in anticipation of renewed buying now that the market has found a temporary floor.\\nOnly some 10-20,000t of prilled urea remain unsold for Feb- ruary and prices have been bid above $200/t fob for small parcels.\\nReports continue to emanate from Turkey that offers are at $195/t cfr, but there is no indication that spot tonnage from Yuzhny or Tuapse has sold at equivalent fob levels.\\nBaltic\\nProducers have sold several parcels of prilled urea for Febru- ary shipment at $182-192/t fob over the past week to traders covering short positions and going long. This has put them in a more comfortable position for February.\\nSBU sold 25,000t of prilled urea to a trader at close to\\n$190/t fob for mid-February loading and a further 15,000t is reported under negotiation in the high-$180s/t fob.

It has 30,000t of prilled urea committed to\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nTrammo and will load a urea/DAP/NPK combination cargo for Africa in February. Its next full cargo of urea is available for early-March loading.\\nUralchem has yet to sell all its February tonnage, but is in discussions and is expected to compete for the Mexican buy- ing pool tender. Its price ideas are above $190/t fob.\\nAmmoni is planning to ship around 25,000t of granular urea from Riga and over 25,000t from Ust-Luga in February. It sold 25,000t last week at $210-215/t fob Riga to two traders on a spot basis. Nitron has bought around 12,000t of Men- deleyevsk granular at a reported price in the low-$190s/t fob for February shipment to Canada.\\nGrodno held a sales tender on 1 February for 15,000t of granular urea for February shipment. It is reported to have sold some of the urea in regional markets and has issued a new tender for 20,000t of granular urea for February ship- ment, closing on 5 February.\\nA trader will load 11,000t of granular urea in Riga 9-10 Feb- ruary for Antwerp.\\nEurope\\nTurkey\\nDemand has slowed now that traders are less willing to short the market aggressively. Gemlik inquired for 25,000t early in the week but had a target of $190/t cfr, which was not attainable. Gubretas held an online tender on 3 February for 10,000t of prilled urea for February shipment, asking for offers to be valid to 6 February. A decision was pending at presstime.\\nThere is still talk of prices as low as $185-190/t cfr but this refers to sales made 2-3 weeks ago when traders were selling short.\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nMiddle East Export Sales\\nFrance\\nOffer prices have dropped to €220-224/t fca this week, helped by the stronger euro, which moved back up to $1.11-\\n1.12on Thursday. Demand is largely covered for February, with urea still in store in major ports to meet it, and new buying is for March-April arrival.\\nA 25,000t Kuwaiti granular urea cargo has been booked for second half February loading that is expected to move to France. Freight is estimated at $17-18/t Shuaiba-French Bay.\\nSpain\\nThere is some interest in granular urea imports but caution over falling prices and loading delays is hampering actual trade. Granular urea is on offer at $252/t cif including 90 days’ credit for immediate loading or at prices below $250/t cif including 90 days’ credit, with laycan/arrivals not fully fixed. Importers are aware that anything arriving in March may be too late for the current cereals application period.\\nAmong recent imports, Medifer is understood to have 4,000t of Algerian urea arriving in Alicante.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nIn the domestic market, Fertiberia is priced at around\\n€240-245/t fca but will be competitive amid falling granular prices. NIC is offering granular urea at €260/t fca.\\nGermany\\nGranular urea prices remain soft and have dropped to €230- 235/t fca, compared with €240-250/t fca two weeks ago. Some small lots are reported to have been concluded within this range for February-March delivery basis open origin, but most buyers have been deterred by falling prices.\\nForwards sales of granular urea are also being offered for June 2016-January 2017 delivery at the suppliers\\' option at prices around €220-225/t fca. But there is little uptake of this offer as buyers remain cautious amid a weak sentiment in the international market.\\nPrilled urea is on offer at €219-223/t fca Baltic sea ports. Again, there is very little interest on the buy side. Trammo is in the freight market to load around 6,000t of urea in Ust Luga on 6-8 February for shipment to Lubeck.\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nMiddle East\\nTwo cargoes of granular urea have been sold at $200/t fob for February loading, marking a step up in prices for non-US markets.

SIUCI has also been offered a spot cargo for early-March loading, indicating bids at $200/t fob for it.\\nSaudi Arabia\\nSabic is reported to have an agreement to supply 100,000t of urea to Sudan over the coming months under a Saudi loan agreement.\\nAfrica\\nEgypt\\nProduction has been interrupted at Egyptian plants since late January.\\nA pipeline explosion in Damietta cut gas supply to the Mopco\\nand ENPC urea plants on 24 January and they are expected to be down until around 20 February.\\nAlexfert and Helwan shutdown on 29 January due to gas supply issues but were down for only 4-5 days and have now restarted. EFC is running at 70pc capacity and says it is directing 40pc of its output to the local market. Helwan has 35,000t of granular urea to sell for February shipment.\\nSales have taken place this week in a range of $215-224/t fob for February shipment, down $8-9/t at the low end on last week’s sales. The sales are being kept confidential, but it is understood that 20,000t were sold at a price netting to $215/t fob to two traders. Trammo purchased 10,000t at $224/t fob, while Keytrade bought 4-5,000t at $218/t fob.\\nSouth Africa\\nUrea imports totalled 663,000t in 2015 according to data from GTIS/SARS, down from 905,000t in 2014. The 2014 import figure was exceptionally high and 2015 imports represent a return to more normal import levels. Three Middle East producers accounted for about 84pc of the total: Qatar sold 231,000t; Saudi Arabia 184,000t; and Abu Dhabi 141,000t. Chinese shipments dropped from 236,000t in 2014 to 25,000t last year.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nAsia\\nChina\\nThe urea market has been quiet ahead of the New Year holiday that starts on 8 February. But suppliers have moved asking prices up this week, with the result that at least one lot of prilled urea sold at $200/t fob to a trader who needed to cover for February loading. Asking prices for granular urea also moved up to the high-$190s/t fob.\\nAt the same time, traders have continued to sell short at prices reflecting $185/t fob for February shipment from China. The market will be slow for the next two weeks and some fall in production is likely during February due to the holiday.\\nDeliveries to ports have slowed over the past two weeks and inventories are estimated at around 1m tonnes. It is impossible to be optimistic about price developments with the background of over-production and high inventories and there may be renewed pressure on prices from late-Febru- ary.\\nIndia\\nThree urea cargoes bought under the last MMTC and IPL ten- ders have been rejected and refused permission to discharge by the Indian government.\\nPIC’s 36,750t vessel m/v Jewel of Sohar sailed four days after the 5 January deadline and has been waiting at Kandla since 15 January. It has not been cleared by DOF for dis- charge. Dreymoor has a 68,000t vessel sold to IPL waiting at Gangavaram due to an issue about particle size. Valency’s 66,000t vessel m/v Long Dar has been waiting to discharge at Gangavaram since 14 December for MMTC.\\nThailand\\nLiven has sold 20,000t of granular urea for February ship- ment at $196/t cfr. It is expected to load the urea in the Arabian Gulf.\\nSri Lanka\\nHaleys has bought 8,000t of prilled urea for February ship- ment from China at $210/t cfr, netting to the mid-$180s/t fob China. Valency is reported to be the supplier.\\nSouth Korea\\nDongbu closed a tender on 3 February for 6,000t of granular urea for shipment by 4 March.

Golden Barley is reported to be the seller.\\nVietnam\\nDemand for 5-6,000t cargoes of granular urea has emerged for February shipment, with 1-2 Fudao cargoes sold and trad- ers also selling against supply from southeast Asia at prices close to $210/t cfr.\\nAmericas\\nUS\\nPrices have firmed this week, rising from initial levels around $190/st fob Nola to $208/st at presstime. The rally in midweek was helped by reports of CF buying in barges of granular urea. The reason was not specified, but prompted speculation about plant outages.\\nMarket sentiment continued to improve through the week, with prompt/February barges trading up to $206-208/st fob and March barges trading at least six times at $210/st fob Nola.\\nSome distributors are happy to sell into the run up, not convinced the market will remain firm, reasoning that cur- rent prices, equivalent to $220-223/t cfr, will pull in spot tonnage. The lack of farmer demand also continues to fuel caution ahead of next week’s TFI meeting.\\nCanada\\nSylvite has bought 12,000t of granular urea from Nitron for February shipment from Ust Luga, Russia.\\nMexico\\nBuyers have come into the market for urea this week, inquiries for around 60,000t of prilled urea circulating for February loading for the east coast.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nA buying group comprising Yara, Isaosa, Tepeyac and Gavilon, held a tender on 4 February for 25,000t for Febru- ary shipment to three ports on the east coast. Several other importers, including Pronamex, Agrogen, ADM and Fertiquim are checking prices for 10-15,000t lots of prilled urea for the east coast.\\nIndications from buyers have been low at around $190/t cfr, but firmer Baltic urea prices this week is likely to mean of- fers are above $200/t cfr.\\nTepeyac is expected in the market to buy 25,000t of granu- lar urea for the west coast shortly.\\nCentral America\\nThe Mexican tender is seen as a test as to whether buyers will accept current suppliers’ price ideas for urea, which are above $200/t cfr.

Around NOK 930m of the total relates to the Yara plants at Montoir, France, and at Point Lisas, Trinidad.\\nYara Montoir will take an impairment charge of about NOK 550m. The plant is one of Yara\\'s smallest fertilizer facilities, with production capacity of around 300,000t/yr of nitrates and 300,000t/yr of NPKs. The plant has limited export opportunities and is exposed to lower profitability in its do- mestic market, given lower grain prices and lower phosphate and potash demand.\\nThe impairment charge for Yara Trinidad is about NOK 380m. The Trinidad plant is one of Yara\\'s smallest ammonia plants, with production capacity of around 270,000t/yr. The plant suffers from frequent gas supply curtailments and also has lower energy efficiency than Yara\\'s average levels.\\nYara\\'s fourth-quarter results will also be affected by lower sales and production volumes compared with the year-earlier period, mainly for ammonia and urea following significant production shutdowns at plants producing those products during the quarter. Deliveries of Yara\\'s own-produced am- monia and urea each fell by about 160,000t compared with a year earlier, while sales of own-produced nitrates were down by around 100,000t.

The agreement, which was signed in August, also gives CHS a minority equity interest in CF Industries Nitrogen, a CF subsidiary.\\nThe 1.7m st of total product available to CHS through the\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nsupply agreement represents roughly 9pc of CF\\'s total pro- duction capacity after the completion of capacity expansion projects at its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, facilities. Expansions at both facilities are anticipated to be complete by the third quarter and will expand CF\\'s total production capacity to 19m st/yr.\\n\"This is an important day for CHS member-owners as we not only complete the single largest investment in our history, but more importantly establish a long-term dependable nitrogen fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and oppor- tunity for economic value,\" CHS chief executive Carl Casale said.\\nThe supply agreement allowed CHS to scrap plans for a $3bn nitrogen fertilizer plant in Spiritwood, North Dakota.\\nMosaic curtails phosphate production\\nThe US’ largest phosphate producer, Mosaic, will cut phos- phate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016, it said today on 3 February.\\nIf fully realized, the cuts will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quarterly finished phosphate production capacity. Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.\\n\"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not changed, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins,\" Mosaic chief executive Joc O\\'Rourke said.\\nThe company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. Prices for US DAP have been in decline since trading at $420/st fob Nola in late October because of lagging domestic and international demand. By late January, DAP prices hovered around $310/ st fob Nola — a 26pc drop and the lowest level since 2009. Since then the market has improved marginally, with trades last week at $315-$320/st fob Nola.\\nUS DAP export prices have also dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to $380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.\\nMosaic\\'s phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as\\nwell. The February Tampa ammonia contract fell by $40/t from January to a six-year low of $310/t cfr. The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013. The prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavor- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute. However, Mosaic believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.\\n\"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand,\" Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. \"Today\\'s crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period.\"\\nUralchem production up 4pc in 2015\\nRussian producer Uralchem raised its output of all fertilizers by about 4pc in 2015 to 5.9m tonnes. Ammonia output grew 4pc to 2.978m tonnes in 2015, while the production of its main product line, ammonium nitrate was marginally down on 2014 at 2.928m tonnes.\\nUrea production rose 7pc to 1.186m tonnes, making Ural- chem the second largest Russian producer. Merchant am- monia output increased by 6pc to 825,000t, while compound fertilizer production rose 18pc to 617,000t.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen\\nNitrogen freight\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nFERTILIZER DERIVATIVES\\nFIS Cash Settled swaps – 4 February 2016\\nFor further swaps information contact: Ron Foxon & Alexey Paliy,\\nFIS Ltd - Office : +44 207 090 1122 or\\nCell: +44 7738726557 ferts@freightinvestor.com\\nArgus FMB Nitrogen is published by Argus Media group\\nRegistered office\\nArgus House, 175 St John St, London, EC1V 4LW Tel: +44 20 7780 4200 Fax: +44 870 868 4338 email: sales@argusmedia.com\\nISSN: 2050-3571\\nCopyright notice\\nCopyright © 2016 Argus Media group All rights reserved\\nAll intellectual property rights in this publication and the information published herein are the exclusive property of Argus and/or its licensors (including exchanges) and may only be used under licence from Argus.

While heavy storms and floods last week hindered field work in the south and parts of the Midwest, the rain proved helpful for drought-stricken areas. West Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota are no longer considered to be in a moderate drought, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Drought Monitor.\\nSouthern states saw a much-needed break in rainfall this week, though precipitation coated most of the Corn Belt and Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and At- mospheric Administration (NOAA). While heavy storms and floods last week hindered field work in the south and parts of the Midwest, the rain proved helpful for drought-stricken areas. West Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota are no longer considered to be in a moderate drought, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Drought Monitor.\\nCrop progress: Heavy storms and historic floods last week did little to hinder crop progress this week, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Corn plantings were 95pc complete the week ended 31 May, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average, while condition for the crop was rated 74pc good or excellent, down two percentage points from the same time last year.\\nUS winter wheat conditions were rated 44pc good or excel- lent the week ended 31 May, 14 percentage points higher than the same time last year. Soybeans were 71pc planted, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average but 10 percentage points ahead of last week. There is some concern exceptionally wet soil conditions could force some southern farmers to switch from cotton to soybeans, which can be planted later in the year than other crops. Overall cotton plantings were 61pc completed the week ended 31 May, down from the 78pc five-year average.\\nCanadian farmers are rushing to replant crops after a cold snap last week curtailed progress. The region had been enjoying unusually warm weather this year, but a late-season frost affected numerous crops, from wheat in Alberta to vineyards in Ontario.\\nCrop prices: A weaker US dollar and field condition concerns proved bullish for crop prices this week. While the USDA’s\\nUS Drought Monitor\\nweekly report did not show material impact to crops, there are reports that field conditions from Canada to Texas have been affected by heavy storms late last month.\\nFront-month wheat futures prices jumped 29¢/bushel from the start of the week to close at $5.23/bushel 4 June. Prices settled higher every day this week, with mid-day gains reaching as high as 16¢/bushel. Front-month soybean prices rose 20¢/bushel from the start of the week to settle at $9.46/bushel 4 June. July prices traded as high as $9.48/ bushel, the strongest value since mid-day trading on 19 May.\\nJuly corn prices were steady compared to those for wheat and soybeans, though they still settled 4 June at $3.63/bush- el, a 13¢/bushel gain from the week’s opening price.\\nFeedstock\\nUS natural gas futures fell to a five-week low late-week on a government report showing a larger-than-expected increase in gas inventories, despite forecasts for warmer weather.\\nNymex gas for July delivery dropped by less than 1¢/mmBtu to settle at $2.626/mmBtu.\\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that gas inventories in the week ended 29 May grew by 132 Bcf (3.7bn m³) — the second largest injection on record and the second consecutive weekly injection to top analyst estimates. The large build reflects mild weather and a down- turn in demand associated with the Memorial Day holiday. Analysts surveyed by Argus had expected an injection of 124 Bcf.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nIn energy regulation news, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that hydraulic fracturing has not led to \"widespread systematic impacts\" on underground water supply.\\n\"We found hydraulic fracturing activities in the US have been carried out in a way that has not led to widespread systemic impacts on drinking water resources,\" EPA deputy assistant administrator Tom Burke said.\\nHydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that in combination with horizontal drilling has enabled the explo- sion in shale gas activity. Environmental groups have raised repeated concerns that its use could contaminate drinking supplies.\\nThose concerns have manifested in bans on hydraulic fracturing in several states. New York, which sits atop the Marcellus shale, declared a statewide ban in December, and other states like Maryland and Vermont have followed suit.\\nFreight\\nA lack of southbound grain shipments and the closure of the Arkansas river combined to firm some spot fertilizer barge rates this week.\\nA few northbound barges have been booked recently on\\nthe limited amount of fertilizer still to be shipped from New Orleans. Barges are plentiful but some operators are hesitant to send equipment north because there is far less grain to ship on the southbound return trip. To offset the loss created by sending empty barges south, deals have been booked at slightly higher prices.\\nGrain is still shipping south from most waterways but several operators say the largest portion of available business is on the Illinois river, helping drive demand. The rate for north- bound barges heading to Ottawa on the Illinois river rose to $13.50-15/short ton from $13.50-14.50/st a week earlier. The barge rate to Joliet rose even higher, to $15-17/st from $15- 16/st last week.\\nBecause of the supply, southbound grain rates from the Illinois river are higher than other waterways. Grain barges from the lower Illinois were priced at $17.31/st during the week ended on 2 June, the US Department of Agriculture said. Barges heading to New Orleans from the lower Ohio riv- er were priced at $9.21/st. One barge operator pulled empty barges from the Ohio up to the Illinois, believing the profit to be made offset the extra transportation costs.\\nThe closure of the Arkansas to freight barges helped raise rates to the Inola/Catoosa hub as shippers are firm in their\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nVWA deals snapshot\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n1\\n0\\nPrices\\nneed to reach the area as quickly as possible. The north- bound fertilizer barge rate rose to $18.25-20/st from $19-19/ st during the prior week.\\nHeavy rain has kept water levels on the waterway high. On the Arkansas state portion of the river, there are eight locks that remain out of service until water levels recede. The James Trimble lock near Barling reopened today, but that is above the closed locks, so no barges are able to pass through.\\nFertilizer shippers are split between redirecting barges to other destinations and holding them until the river opens. Many have chosen to pay daily demurrage fees and ship when the Arkansas opens.\\nThere are more than 20 tows of barges parked in Rosedale, Mississippi, waiting to head north up the river. Argus’ weekly assessment of spot demurrage has held steady at an average $300/day since mid-December.\\nNitrogen\\nTop-dress season is in full swing with growers currently applying nitrogen products when weather allows. That consumption has kept the market balanced with both urea and UAN imports still ahead of last year’s pace. Usage over the next few weeks will be a key determinant for carryout, which for now looks to be limited across nitrogen products.\\nUrea (g)\\nThe US urea barge market was largely unchanged this week with most loading windows trading at similar values to last week. Buying continues to resupply warehouses upriver—for\\nEstimated incoming urea vessels\\ncorn top dress in the Midwest and for rice applications in the southeast. For now, slower consumption and less imports are offsetting.\\nTrades for non-Chinese urea loading within 30 days conclud- ed in a range $319-355/st fob Nola, nearly unchanged from $320-358/st fob Nola. The low end of the range was set by a\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nUrea prices and barge freight from Nola ($/st)\\nTwin Cities\\nIllinois\\nRiver\\nSt Louis\\nNola\\nfob337.00\\nAll freight points are priced from origin of mile 90-184 of Lower Mississippi River\\ntrade for June loading, while the high end of the range was set by trades for loaded barges.\\nThere was a notable drop in pricing (about $7/st) for loaded barges over the weekend, which coincided with the end of May and expiration of that window. Barges that loaded in May were priced at a premium as some suppliers needed them for contractual obligations.\\nLooking to the forward market, barges for loading in early July are at about a $15/st discount to June based on 1H July trades this week at $305/st fob Nola. August-loading barges were offered in the mid/high-$280s/st fob Nola this week. Based on the swaps market, the market for fall urea is at about $280/st, while 1Q 2016 is indicated in the $270s/st fob Nola, reflecting the pressure of new domestic and interna- tional production coming online over the next few months.\\nThe most notable development this week in the urea warehouse market is a shortage in Inola/Catoosa caused by the closure of the Arkansas river. High water has made it impassable since mid May. Initially, the wet weather had stopped fertilizer demand, but with corn top-dress applica- tions ramping back up most bins in the important Southern\\nPlains distribution hub are near empty.\\nOffers for prompt loading urea rose to $385-390/st fot this week, with many suppliers forced to pull offers for anything loading in June. Barges are expected to reach Inola/Catoosa by the end of this month barring further heavy rains.\\nLikely reflecting pricing woes before the last two months’ rally, April urea imports fell 34pc year-over-year to 695,753st. Most of the product arrived from the Middle East and Canada with imports from China just 35,091st for the month.\\nFertilizer year-to-date imports are now just 9pc ahead of last year at 7.2mn st. Given the tonnage consumed by rice demand early this fertilizer year, net supply for the period is now about even with last year.\\nUrea (p)\\nThe market for both melt and feed grade prills continue to be indicated at a notable discount to granular—an unusual pricing relationship—given the prompt application demand for the latter product.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nThe market was inactive this week following a feed grade barge transaction at a netback of about $300/st fob Nola last week.\\nMelt grade prills last traded in the range of $275-280/st fob Nola.\\nInternational urea highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Prilled urea offers in China have increased to $310/t fob, up some $10/t from last week and near the level of granular there. The local market continues to absorb most of the country’s production, and producers are commanding ever higher prices for urea going to export. In an unusual price relationship, Chinese prilled urea is currently offered at about the same price as Middle East granular urea.\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, the price standoff between importers and trad- ers with granular urea cargoes continued for another week. Bids have increased to $320/t cfr, while offers are clinging to $330/t cfr. Those offers equate to about a $300/st fob Nola barge price, near the market for early July loading barges.\\nUAN\\nThe US UAN market continues to transition from spring to\\nGenscape: Recent and expected UAN vessels\\nsummer fill pricing, and preliminary summer fill business has concluded at values about $65/st below the highest prices achieved earlier this year. Producers have not published fill values, but some suppliers have already locked in their cost for at least some of this summer’s supply. The official fill value, where a significant portion of the inventory replenish- ment will occur, remains a moving target.\\nThis preliminary business has been reported in the $205- 210/st range for loading in either June or July. That value is about $30/st below last year’s published fill value, which was announced in mid-June of 2014.\\nThe market for prompt-loading UAN is unclear, but price indications suggest it would be somewhere between the fill range and the netbacks implied by upriver tank prices. Taking this into account, UAN Nola barge is assessed at $205- 225/st fob Nola this week.\\nFollowing multiple transactions for June and July arrival east coast UAN imports in the mid-$220s/t cfr, offers have increased to the mid-$230s/t cfr. Buyers are showing further interest in summer fill cargoes, but not yet at that price point.\\n* Indicates confirmation with Zepol import/export database.\\nValues without * are estimates based on vessel size and/or previous shipments.\\n— Genscape\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n0\\nAmmonium sulfate (g)\\nThe US amsul market remains stable as growth in consump- tion and some production issues have more than offset lower net exports so far this fertilizer year.\\nCorn Belt warehouse prices are discussed slightly lower, now in the range of $310-320/st fot.\\nSome summer fill offers have already surfaced. One was reported at $290/st fot in the Twin Cities region.\\nAmmonia\\nTerminal values have moved slightly lower as suppliers vie to end the season with tanks empty. The Cincinnati/Jefferson- ville market is priced in the range of $291-302/st fot, down about $5/st. Some terminals further south have moved to $285/st fot.\\nAmmonium nitrate (p)\\nThe AN barge market is still indicated in the range of $365- 370/st fob Nola with the last transaction earlier this spring. Since then, imported AN was distributed to warehouses under various sales agreements.\\nWarehouse prices have softened in some regions, particu- larly those competing with tons from domestic producers. In the Inola/Catoosa market, offers have been reported in the range of $325-335/st fot. There has also been softness noted in Corn Belt and Mid South with prices moving to $335-345/ st fot.\\nThe Tampa market is still stable with business concluding in the range of $340-345/st fot.\\nPrices were marginally weaker in the US ammonia market this week as the side-dress season winds down. Inventory is tight for this point in the season, but there has been some price competition as suppliers look to unload tons before de- mand runs out. Most suppliers expect little carryover in part because cool weather has held back corn growth, allowing more time for side dress.\\nOne supplier had some particularly competitive offers in the east Corn Belt this week, pushing the high end of prices down from $630/st fot to $620/st fot. Offers in Illinois are largely in the range of $600-610/st fot, while Indiana termi- nals are priced about $10/st higher.\\nIn the west Corn Belt, offers are now universally below the $600/st mark with little offtake expected for the rest of the season. Offers in eastern Nebraska are at about $560/st fot.\\nOklahoma production sites’ offers are still pegged at $525/ st fot. Regional offtake has been limited with most product heading east on the pipeline or by truck. There has been some talk about the issuance of summer fill prices over the\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nnext two weeks or so.\\nApril US ammonia imports increased 10pc year-over-year to 564,287st, bringing the fertilizer year-to-date total to 4.9mn st, a 4pc increase from the same period last year. Trinidad and Tobago has accounted for about two-thirds of that sup- ply.\\nInternational ammonia highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Koch has bought another 40,000t from Yuzhny for end- June loading, which will ship to the US, likely on the Jenny N. The trader already loaded the Clipper Orion with 40,000t from Yuzhny for the US on 31 May. Lastly, Koch is loading about 35,000t in the Baltic for Taft, Louisiana.\\n\\x84\\x84Sabic has sold a 23,000t cargo to Mitsui for 10-20 July loading.

The drop ended four weeks of gains for the DAP Nola assessment. Forward physical indications show slight backwardation, with August DAP offered at $418/st fob Nola and September trading at $416/st. Paper values are tending in line.\\nThat flat forward curve has contributed to a lack of urgency on the buy side. US prices have disconnected from interna- tional levels, with Nola at a discount to other markets, mak- ing substantial imports unlikely in the near-term.\\nSecond-half US import volume likely hinges on Morocco. Many traders have operated under the belief that Morocco’s OCP would resume shipments to the US in the third quarter— some estimating as much as 300,000t DAP/MAP/TSP—but if the US remains priced lower than competing markets, the Moroccans could look elsewhere to take advantage of more favorable netbacks.\\nUS phosphate import tracker\\nPhosphate barge business\\nChinese DAP/MAP imports figured heavily in the US’ third quarter 2014 import total at a record 86,556t DAP and 67,822t MAP for that period. But a repeat in 2015 is unlikely given resurgent Indian demand this year that has consumed much Chinese production and kept China fob prices stable at $460-475/t fob, which is higher than current Nola prices on a midpoint basis.\\nUS phosphate import totals should ease for May and June after keeping an elevated pace during the third quarter and April. April DAP imports totaled 216,973st compared to just 23,363st during the same time in 2014, according to customs data. Moroccan DAP made up most of the total at 158,689st, with Russia accounting for 56,109st.\\nMoroccan DAP imports in April eclipsed the full-year 2014 total of 89,500st. Moroccan shipments to the US have tradi- tionally skewed more toward MAP, but DAP shipments have accelerated for a number of likely reasons, including an off- take agreement with PotashCorp following that company’s shutting of its Suwanee River plant (approximately 500,000 t/yr finished phosphate) and the loss of MissPhos production late in 2014 (600,000 st/yr DAP).\\nFertilizer year-to-date DAP imports are 736,435st, more than six times the amount from the same time last year.\\nMAP imports dropped slightly year-over-year to 66,409st. Morocco and Russia were again the dominant sources at\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n24,211st and 38,528st, respectively. Despite the slight drop in April, fertilizer year-to-date MAP imports of 1mn st are more than double the prior-year period total.\\nUS DAP exports declined for the fourth consecutive month to 103,652t in April, the lowest level since November 2008 (83,393t) and down from 114,566t in March. MAP exports stood at a more normal level in April at 170,751t, with about 60,000t each shipped to Canada and Brazil.\\nIn fresh export business, Mosaic sold 38,000t DAP/MAP/Mi- croEssentials to South America at $471-475/t fob Tampa for July shipment.\\nUS 3Q DAP imports\\nMexico’s Fertinal will ship 35,000t DAP/MAP/TSP to Chile in the first half of June and has allocated a to-be-determined cargo to a trader. The producer will focus the balance of its production on the domestic Mexican market along with small lots to Central America.\\nDAP/MAP\\nPhosphate barges traded thinly this week, contributing to the move lower in offers. Prompt/June-loading domestic DAP offers fell from $423/st fob Nola early in the week to $418- 420/st, with no confirmed trades. The DAP Nola assessment is adjusted to $418-423/st fob accordingly. The MAP barge assessment is lowered by $5/st on the low end from last week to $425-435/st fob Nola to reflect an indicated $5-10/st premium to DAP.\\nDAP/MAP warehouse prices remain static in the face of limited demand, except for Inola/Catoosa, which has seen offers firm at $465/st fot. The higher price has been driven in part by the closure of the Arkansas river because of high water conditions. The river is not likely to reopen to barge traffic for another week or two, meaning resupply would not reach Inola/Catoosa until late June.\\nInternational phosphate highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Bangladesh’s purchase tender for 400,000t DAP for third quarter delivery that closed on 31 May attracted 53 offers for a total of 1.556mn t. Prices ranged from $479-534.14/t cfr plus bags/bagging. Prices for the first 400,000t ranged from $479-491/t. Most offers were backed by Chinese producers. Awards are expected to be awarded within the coming days.\\n\\x84\\x84Morocco’s OCP has sold 240,000t MAP for June shipment to Brazil, including one cargo for its own system, at $500/t cfr, which nets back to the mid/high-$480s/t fob Jorf Las- far. The producer has also sold 80,000t DAP/MAP to Europe for that same period at $505-515/t fob.\\n\\x84\\x84In Tunisia, two of GCT’s four phosphate rock mine re- started this week after operations were halted by protests in the country. The producers finished fertilizer products plants remain down as the company needs to rebuild phos- phate rock inventory before restarting, which is estimated to be at the end of June.\\nUS MAP 3Q imports\\n625domestic producers, with spring demand largely concluded.\\n575Barge prices trended flat to down this week, with the as-\\nsessment set at $320-330/st fob Nola for the third consecu- tive week, though the high end of that range—indicated for\\n475domestic barges—is becoming harder to achieve. Several\\n425market participants still have barges on offer on the river\\nsystem and, with the heart of spring planting demand having passed, are more willing to entertain lower offers in order to\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nenter the summer refill season with no inventory. Sub-$320/ st fob Nola business has been discussed but not confirmed as of press time.\\nWarehouse offtake has slowed to a trickle across the Corn Belt, with planting nearing completion. Most offers stand at $370-380/st fot depending on location, with sub-$370/st prices still available in areas.\\nDomestic producers have yet to introduce formal summer fill prices, which remain a source of debate. Suppliers argue that prices will not come off much from the low end of cur- rent prices, pointing particularly to the international market for support. US prices have pulled to a more typical $23/t premium to Brazil after reaching nearly $50/t in March. Sustained strength in Brazil could help put in a floor for US prices. Buyers contend that a posted price adjustment down to current spot levels would not do much to inspire fresh buying interest, especially given the lack of supply concerns drive by record domestic production in the first quarter and elevated import levels since last fall.\\nThe US import lineup for June and July looks thin at pres- ent. Russia’s Uralkali plans to ship normal volumes, likely two to three vessels over June and July. The US imports no MOP from Russia in June and July 2014, but took 70,420t in August and 135,000t in September. Other import sources are up in the air, with the impact of the now-ended strike at ICL’s Dead Sea Works plant in Israel undetermined. There is also the possibility of Belarusian tons making their way to Nola again after reestablishing a presence in the US market in the first quarter of 2015.\\nApril imports keep up strong pace\\nUS potash imports from Canada maintained high levels. The US imported 1mn st MOP from Canada in April, up by 5pc\\nyear-over-year and marking the second consecutive month Canadian potash imports reached the 1mn st mark. Canadian MOP imports topped 1mn st in May and June in 2014, when easing logistical issues allowed producers to catch up on much-delayed shipments.\\nUS imports of Canadian potash have mirrored increased pro- duction following recent mine expansions in Saskatchewan. North American potash production reached a record level in the first quarter of 2015.\\nOffshore MOP imports fell to their lowest level since Decem- ber, totaling 112,569st, with Russia accounting for almost the entire total. Russian imports have topped 100,000st for three straight months after achieving that level just once in 2014.\\nFertilizer year-to-date MOP imports stand at 10.4mn st, a 21pc year-over-year increase, which has contributed to soft- ening US prices through the spring.\\nUS SOP imports jumped to 27,013st, their highest point since December 2007. The rise was primarily the result of 17,474st from Germany combined with smaller lots from Canada, Chile, Egypt and Taiwan. Of the German shipments, about 10,000st went to Wilmington, North Carolina, with a pair of 3,300st loads to Norfolk, Virginia, and Nola. The Chilean ton- nage all went to San Francisco, California.\\nSOP has been in tight supply dating back to last year, with domestic production struggling to keep up with demand. Despite the tight supply situation, imports had not showed any notable jumps—until this month.\\nInternational potash highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture has made awards un- der its 31 May purchase tender for 240,000t MOP. Channels offering Belarusian tonnage accounted for 192,000t of the total at $344/t cfr including 180 days payment terms. Can- potex material was offered at $335/t cfr sight. Shipments are to be made by September 2015.\\n\\x84\\x84Brazil prices are stable with June granular MOP sales this week concluding at $330-335/t cfr, with producers now indicating offers at $340-345/t cfr for July cargoes.\\n\\x84\\x84Australian potash exploration company South Boulder Mines will change its name to Danakali, effective 4 June. The name change is meant to reflect the company’s Colluli SOP project in Eritrea, which is located in the Danakil re-\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\ngion of east Africa. A pre-feasibility study showed the Colluli project to have the potential for 425,000 t/yr SOP produc- tion, with production expected to begin in 2018.\\nGlobal sulfur prices\\nSulfur and sulfuric acid\\nSulfur\\nSyncrude sulfur shipments are slowing ramping up to normal volumes after restarting last week as production from crude upgraders restart. The largest of the facility’s three crude upgraders recently completed a five-week planned mainte- nance, while Shell restarted its operations at its Scotford upgrader 19 May. The two facilities produced a combined 111,994t of sulfur in January.\\nThe US market is described as balanced-to-long, with some fertilizer producers in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain\\nIssue 15-22\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 4 June 2015\\nregions being offered unneeded additional supply. Refinery utilization in the US was 93.2pc the week ended 29 May, down 0.4 percentage points from the previous week but 2.4 percentage points above the same time last year, according to EIA data. Rates in the US Gulf coast surged to 96.9pc last week, the highest level since 5 December 2014.\\nInternational sulfur highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In the United Arab Emirates, sulfur producer ADNOC raised its Official Selling Price (OSP) 1 June by $5/t to $145/t fob Ruwais for June lifting. The April and May prices were at $140/t fob.\\nSulfuric acid\\nPCS has pushed back the closure of its sulfur-burning sulfuric acid plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The 450,000 t/yr capacity plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May but will now shut down later this month. While it is understood that PCS has secured 75-80pc of its sulfuric acid needs via supply con- tracts, market participants are still anxious to see how much of an impact the curtailment will have on the spot market, both offshore and domestic.\\nThe US southwest and west coast regions are still described as tight, despite a key source of supply coming back online recently. Asarco completed planned maintenance two weeks ago at its copper smelter in Hayden, Arizona. The 45,000 t/ month smelter went into a 45-day turnaround in early April.\\nInternational sulfuric acid highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, it is understood that Petrobras’ 25 May import tender for 15,000t of sulfuric acid for 25 June-5 July deliv- ery was awarded in the mid-$80s/t cfr Barra dos Coqueiros.\\nFertilizer news\\nEPA sets 2014-16 RFS levels, notes blend wall\\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set rising biofuel quotas for 2014-2016 but recognized the limitations of the \"blend wall\" in long-delayed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposals released on 29 May.\\nRefiners, importers and other companies must ensure at least 16.3bn USG of ethanol, biodiesel and other biofuels are blended into the US transportation supply in 2015 under rules proposed by the EPA, which was acting under a court order to issue 2014 and 2015 levels by 1 June.\\nand proposed a 2016 level of 17.4bn USG.\\nThe agency has worked to balance the wishes of some US lawmakers for higher biofuel usage against the realities of a US fuel infrastructure and vehicle fleet unable to legally consume volumes envisioned by Congress when it enacted the RFS in 2007.\\nBiofuel makers say the rules are essential to creating a level playing field with fossil fuels, while refiners say they create a regulatory burden.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nlimit to the amount of biofuels that US retailers and vehicles can absorb.\\nThe proposals increase required blending levels from those last proposed in 2013 but continue to cite the limits of both consumer and retailer demand for higher-ethanol biofuels.\\nEPA stunned the biofuel industry in 2013 with a proposal that for the first time cited a lack of fuel infrastructure and compatible vehicles to reduce proposed biofuel blending mandates for 2014.\\nRules proposed today require 106mn USG of cellulosic biofuel blending, 1.7bn USG of biomass-based biodiesel and 2.9bn USG of advanced biofuel blending as part of the total blending requirements. The proposal leaves a minimum 13.4bn USG for conventional ethanol blending.\\nVolumes for 2016 would require 206mn USG of cellulosic biofuel, 1.8bn USG of biomass-based biodiesel and 3.4bn USG of advanced biofuel blending, leaving a minimum 14bn USG to be filled with conventional ethanol or other biofuels.\\nProposed requirements for 2014 include 33mn USG of cellu- losic biofuel blending, 1.63bn USG of biomass-based biodies- el and 2.68bn USG of advanced biofuel blending.\\nDAP/MAP use contributes to Lake Erie woes\\nA widespread switch to DAP/MAP fertilizer and post-harvest usage are likely key contributors to phosphorous runoff that has resulted in harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) researchers have found.\\nUSDA researchers outlined 24 separate factors that collec- tively cause phosphorous runoff into Lake Erie in a study published in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation this month. Co-author and USDA research soil scientist Doug Smith in an interview with Argus expanded on DAP and MAP fertilizer\\'s role in contributing to phosphorous loss that leads to algal blooms.\\nFarmers in the western Lake Erie basin, which encompasses parts of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, switched from TSP fer- tilizer to DAP and MAP beginning in the mid-1990s.\\nIndiana consumed 175,000st DAP and 126,000st MAP, the fifth and seventh highest levels in the US, respectively , in 2012, compared to only 1,012st of TSP, according to most recent data from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO). Ohio consumed 63,000st of DAP\\nin 2012 (11th most in the US), 95,000st MAP (eighth most) and just 41 short tons of TSP.\\nDAP and MAP, while containing a similar amount of soluble phosphorous as TSP, could suffer greater phosphorous loss because of their lower acidity, Smith said. Less acidic soils result in greater phosphorous availability to plants, increas- ing the risk of soluble phosphorous loss, USDA research shows. Soils are also generally less acidic now because of stricter air pollution standards that have reduced acid rain.\\nCompounding the issue is the common practice of applying DAP and MAP after harvest, often onto frozen or snow-cov- ered ground. S said farmers like applying on frozen ground because it reduces the risk for soil compaction while running heavy application equipment over fields. But DAP and MAP sitting on the surface of barren soil with no crops to take up nutrients is more susceptible to running off.\\n\"My working hypothesis is that what we\\'re doing right now is applying about the most soluble form of phosphate that we can get to land at a time when nothing is growing on the soil and won\\'t be for months,\" Smith said. \"So we\\'ve kind of backed ourselves into a system that\\'s the most prone to phosphorous loss.\"\\nOhio lawmakers recently took steps to address applications in such situations, approving a law that will fine farmers who apply fertilizer on snow-covered or frozen ground—unless it is injected, incorporated into the soil within 48 hours or ap- plied to a growing crop.\\nBut even regulations like that could still foster phosphorous runoff by shortening the application window.\\n\"I think that\\'s probably a step in the right direction from a water quality perspective,\" Smith said. \"But from a farmer\\'s and fertilizer industry perspective, that puts more pressure to put more product on the ground in less time.\"\\nThe burden is not the farmer\\'s to bear alone, Smith said. Many growers strictly follow fertilizer recommendations pro- vided by crop specialists or university extension programs.\\nLand rent agreements complicate the matter, since they require farmers to adhere to university recommendations, regardless of individual soil test results. About 50pc of farm land in the western Lake Erie basin is rented. These rec- ommendations often do not take into account the amount phosphorous already in the soil, instead just focusing on\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nreplacing the amount taken up by the plant.\\n\"To me, the farmer is doing what we as a scientific commu- nity is telling them to do and what the industry is providing them with and they\\'re kind of taking the fall for it,\" Smith said.\\nPossible runoff solutions highlighted by the USDA include applying lower rates of phosphorous in line to specific soil needs and updating soil tests. Smith said that the Fertilizer Institute\\'s 4R Nutrient Stewardship certification program is a step in the right direction.\\nUS crop conditions unchanged after floods\\nCrop conditions defied expectations after heavy storms hit the Midwest and Southern Plains over the last week, ac- cording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.\\nFront-month wheat futures prices jumped 16¢/bushel to close at $4.93/bushel today in anticipation of worse winter wheat conditions because of storms last week that caused flooding in the Midwest and Southern Plains.\\nBut US winter wheat conditions were rated 44pc good or excellent the week ended 31 May, just one percentage point down from last week and 14 percentage points higher than the same time last year. Only five of the top 18 producing states reported 20pc of their wheat in poor or very poor condition. Winter wheat conditions in Texas and Oklahoma, which both recorded their wettest months ever in May, were rated 51pc and 36pc good or excellent, respectively.\\nWinter wheat was 84pc headed last week, up seven per- centage points on the five-year average. All winter wheat in Arkansas and Oklahoma is headed, while Texas (99pc), North Carolina (98pc), Missouri (95pc), Kansas (97pc) and Illinois (94pc) are all above the 90pc mark. Ohio (69pc) and Indiana\\n(79pc) are the only two states behind the five-year average.\\nSpring wheat condition is rated 96pc fair or better, un- changed from the previous week. South Dakota is the only state to have more than 6pc of its spring wheat in poor or very poor condition. Overall spring wheat is 91ps emerged, well ahead of the 69pc five-year average.\\nOverall corn condition is rated 97pc fair or better, down just one percentage point from the same time last year. Mis- souri and Kansas are the only two states with at least 10pc of corn rated poor or very poor. Favorable growing condi-\\ntions allowed the US to produce a record 171 bushels/acre in 2014, and the USDA has pegged 2015 projected yields at\\n166.8bushels/acre, which would be the second highest ever if realized.\\nCorn plantings were 95pc complete the week ended 31 May, one percentage point behind the five-year average. Texas (83pc), Nebraska (94pc), Kansas (86pc) and Colorado (79pc) were the only states of the top 18 producers to lag behind the average. Corn plantings are finished in Illinois.\\nThe number of days suitable for field work was mixed the week ended 31 May. Texas (2.9) and Oklahoma (1.4) showed slight improvements despite wide-spread flooding, while Illinois (3.5), Iowa (2.3), Kentucky (3.6), Michigan (4.3) and Missouri (0.9) were saw drops in suitable days.\\nSoybeans were 71pc planted, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average but 10 percentage points ahead of last week. Plantings in Kansas were just 21pc completed, behind the 63pc average, while Missouri have planted 23pc of its soybean, down from the 57pc average.\\nPlantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 61pc completed, down from the 78pc average, while sorghum was 43pc planted, behind its 55pc average.\\nAmmonia release during Agrium Borger restart\\nA small ammonia release during the restart of Agrium\\'s Borger, Texas, nitrogen facility on 28 May shut down a urea plant and sent 16 contract workers to the hospital.\\nThe company said it believes the release was caused by a \"sight glass failure\" in the ammonia pump in the urea plant, which was in the process of restarting. About 80 pounds of ammonia were released, Agrium said.\\nThe 80,000 t/yr urea and 490,000 t/yr gross ammonia plants shut down on 18 May because of a tube leak in the ammonia unit\\'s reformer.\\nThe ammonia plant was not affected by the ammonia release and is operating normally. Agrium expects the urea plant to resume production within a few days.\\nThe affected workers were contractors working on expan- sions at the facility. Agrium is in the process of an expansion that will add a new 610,000 t/yr urea plant and increase gross ammonia capacity to 635,000 t/yr. The company plans\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nto take the ammonia plant into turnaround during the sec- ond half of 2015 to tie in the expansion, while the new urea plant is expected to begin production in early 2016.\\nWork starts on K+S Canada potash export hub\\nK+S and Pacific Coast Terminals (PCT) this week began con- struction of potash export infrastructure at PCT\\'s existing terminal in Port Moody, British Columbia.\\nThe companies will build a warehouse with capacity to store more than 150,000t of MOP produced at K+S\\' Legacy mine in Saskatchewan, which is on track to begin production in the second half 2016.\\nThe expanded terminal will also feature a new railcar un- loading station, conveyor systems and dust emission con- trols. Potash will be shipped via Canadian Pacific rail from the Legacy mine site to Port Moody.\\nThe Port Moody project received approval to begin construc- tion from Port Metro Vancouver in March. PCT\\'s Port Moody terminal already exports sulfur and ethylene glycol.\\nGermany-based K+S expects the Legacy solution mine to reach 2mn t/yr MOP capacity by the end of 2017, eventu- ally increasing to nameplate capacity of 2.86mn t/yr. When completed, it will be the first greenfield potash mine to be commissioned in Saskatchewan in nearly 40 years.\\nArgus FMB Technical Fertilizer Conference and Exhibition 2015\\nNPKs: Increasing efficiencies through\\nnew production and application technologies\\n3-5 June 2015\\nBangkok, Thailand\\nwww.argusmedia.com/fertilizertech-asia\\nPersonnel news\\nIFA elects GPIC’s Jawahery as president\\nThe International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) has elected Dr. Abdulrahman Jawahery as its next president, succeeding Esin Mete.\\nBody copyJawahery is president of Bahrain-based Gulf Petro- chemicals Industries Co (GPIC), a major producer of nitrogen fertilizers.

Nebraska was the only state to see steady precipitation throughout the week, as rainfall largely dis- sipated by mid-week across the country.\\nThere is a moderate chance of rain across the entire Corn Belt and down to Texas in the 6-10 day forecast, includ- ing severe thunderstorms in the plains, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The wet weather will not last long, however, with precipita- tion chances lessening in the eastern Corn Belt and southern states in the 8-14 day forecast. Temperatures are expected to be higher than usual and lower Corn Belt, especially in the Mississippi Delta, which should bode well for harvesting.\\nCrop progress: While US crop progress was mostly in line with previous weeks, some areas are still dealing with issues stemming from heavy storms and floods several weeks ago. Areas near the Arkansas river have been particularly af- fected by flooding, with the state seeking federal assistance for 37 counties. Texas and Oklahoma, which saw the wet- test months in state history in May, are also behind five-year average for wheat and oat harvesting, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\\nOverall, US crop condition has shown little impact from the heavy storms. Winter wheat condition – the biggest area of concern – was rated 30pc good or excellent and 20pc of the crop rated poor or very poor. The inclement weather did delay harvests for winter wheat, which is 4pc finished, eight percentage points down from the five-year average. But late- season rains could prove beneficial for wheat long term, with\\nAverage US grain rail metrics, 4 Apr 15 to 29 May 1\\nproduction expected to rise 95mn bushels year-on-year to 2.1bn bushels this year, according to the USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).\\nCorn conditions were stable at 74pc good or excellent, unchanged from last week. US corn was also 91pc emerged, up slightly from the five-year average of 90pc. Total US corn supply is expected climb to 15.5bn bushels in 2015, up 59mn bushels from last year, on higher beginning stocks, according to the WASDE. Soybean plantings were 79pc finished, two percentage points behind the average. The overall percent-\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nage has been weighed down by Kansas and Missouri, which are 45 percentage points and 39 percentage points behind their respective averages. Annual soybean production is forecast to fall 119mn bushels to 3.9mn bushels.\\nCrop prices: Front-month wheat futures prices quickly changed sentiment this week on the heels on the WASDE release. Prices had reach a peak of $5.37/bushel on weather concerns, but fell as much as 21¢/bushel in midday trading when the report was released 10 June. Prices continued to fall afterward, settling 11 June at $5.04/bushel.\\nFront-month corn prices had a less exaggerated reaction to the WASDE and were seemingly unaffected by surging ethanol production (see News Section). July prices fell 10¢/ bushel in midday trading 10 June and settling 11 June at $3.56/bushel. December corn prices also fell slightly on the report, dropping 7¢/bushel week-on-week to settle 11 June at $3.74/bushel.\\nFront-month soybean prices were the most stable, falling just 4¢/bushels week-on-week to settle 11 June at $9.40/ bushel. November soybeans prices had a more bearish reaction the WASDE, falling 13¢/bushel in midday trading 10 June. The November contract settled 11 June at $9.08/ bushel, a 16¢/bushel drop from last week.\\nFeedstock\\nUS natural gas futures ended lower as traders sold off some contracts following a report showing a large build in US stockpiles. Nymex gas for July delivery fell by 6.6¢/mmBtu, or 2.3pc, to settle at $2.825/mmBtu.\\nPrompt-month prices had moved up by 12pc since hitting a five-week settlement low at the end of last week. That sharp increase on forecasts for hotter weather spurred some traders, who had bet on rising prices, to sell off contracts and take profits.\\nUS natural gas inventories should end the injection season at near-record levels amid higher gas production, despite warmer summer weather and increased gas use by the power generation sector.\\nStockpiles will reach 3.912 Tcf (111bn m³) ahead of the 1 November start of the heating season, the US Energy Infor- mation Administration (EIA) said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. At that level, inventories would be 115 Bcf higher than the five-year-average, end-of-season level and just 17 Bcf shy of the all-time high of 3.929 Tcf set on 2 November 2012.\\nAmmonia margin vs natural gas\\nHenry Hub (left scale) $/mnBtu\\nAmmonia producer margin (right scale) $/st\\nUS stockpiles have increased rapidly this year because of a surge in domestic production. Marketed natural gas output, which excludes production losses, hit a record high in De- cember 2014 of 79.19 Bcf/d, up by 13pc from a year earlier, as producers continued to tap gas-rich formations such as the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and south Texas\\' Eagle Ford shale.\\nMarketed production declined slightly in the subsequent months as cold weather shuttered some wells. But initial data for April and May indicate that production growth resumed and output in July should top the record high in December, the EIA said.\\nHenry Hub spot prices in 2015 should average $3.06/mmBtu, down from a year-earlier average of $4.52/mmBtu, the EIA said. Electric utilities are expected to use low-cost gas gen- eration this year as a substitute for some coal-fired power to meet electricity demand.\\nFreight\\nLogistics problems are firming fertilizer barge rates as opera- tors struggle to catch up on shipments delayed by weather and operational difficulties. Normally rates are flat to lower in summer.\\nHigh water on the Arkansas river has kept barges off that waterway. Delayed fertilizer shipments are not expected to reach hubs on the upper part of the Arkansas until the first week of July despite improving conditions.\\nLimited barge operations resumed yesterday on the river, more than four weeks after traffic stopped because of the high water. But efforts to restart traffic are focusing on moving southbound barges off the waterway to make room\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nNorthbound rates originating from miles 90-184 for dry, bulk fertilizers. * No freight rates available based on seasonal closures.\\nfor northbound barges parked in Rosedale and bring towing power south on the river.\\nFlood levels on the Arkansas were the highest in 25 years, according to the National Climatic Data Center. River flows peaked above 350,000 cf/s three times, the US Army Corps of Engineers said. Normal flows for this time of year range from 30,000-50,0000 cf/s. The corps projects flows of 44,000-77,000 cf/s by the first full week in July.\\nOn the Arkansas, rates for destinations between Pine Bluff\\nand Little Rock have jumped because water levels are lower in that area, causing operators to focus deliveries there first. Rates increased to $14.50-16.50/st from $13.50-14.50/st a week earlier.\\nShipments to the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers have been delayed by logistics problems in the St Louis area.\\nOperations have slowed since 116 barges broke away from their moorings on 30 May, causing the US Coast Guard to temporarily close the upper Mississippi. The barges were recovered later that same day but sorting the equipment into the correct designated fleeting areas has taken time, particularly as operators are delivering new barges to St Louis at the same time. And high water in the St Louis area is limiting night-time shipments for barge tows greater than 600ft in length.\\nRates for loadings in the first half of July have increased because of these problems. On the Mississippi, barges for St Louis rose to $9-10.75/st from $9-10/st last week.\\nNitrogen\\nStrong rice and corn top-dress demand led to a surge in prompt urea prices this week, while also pulling up first-half July values. Rice demand is expected to support urea prices through the end of June. Other nitrogen products trended flat-to-lower this week as prices transition to summer reset levels.\\nUrea (g)\\nWith rice demand in full swing, suppliers scrambled this week to secure prompt/loaded urea barges, causing a sharp rise in prices.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nVWA deals snapshot\\n8\\n7\\n6\\n5 hh Volume 4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n309 314 315 329 332 341 346 347 348 350 355 362 370\\nPrices\\nup from business last week at $305/st fob for that loading window.\\nTrades for barges loading within 30 days spanned a wide\\n$309-370/st fob Nola range—the largest low/high difference for the Nola assessment since 17 July 2014. Trading focused primarily on two loading periods: prompt/loaded and first- half July.\\nPrompt/loaded barges traded multiple times at $355/st fob Nola before climbing late-week as high as $370/st fob Nola. The high end of this week’s business represents the highest point for the assessment since July 2014 and marks a $94/st rise in prices over the last two months.\\nPrices for June-loading barges rose sharply over the course of the week, going from $329/st fob Nola to $355/st fob Nola. First-half July trades ranged from $309-315/st fob Nola,\\nThe firming US market attracted additional June/July spot cargoes to Nola. Ameropa diverted 35,000t ex-Kuwait from Brazil to the US, while Koch declared a 35,000t June ves- sel from Oman for the US Gulf. Indagro has 27,500t on the Servet Ana from Algeria expected to arrive in late June/ early July. OCI also has 25,000t loading in Egypt beginning 15 June.\\nUrea warehouse prices also firmed this week, particularly in Inola/Catoosa, where the closure of the Arkansas river has sent prices above $400/st fot on increasingly thin supply. Sales were concluded from $400-415/st fot in that market this week, nearly a $100/st rise from early April. Some estimate stocks could be fully depleted in that market by next week.

The price surge is expected to be temporary, with July loading urea offers at $350/st fot.\\nThe scarcity of urea in Inola/Catoosa has sent suppliers look- ing for tons from other markets and pulled up prices accord- ingly. St Louis sales ranged from $370-380/st fot this week, up from $360-365/st last week.\\nCincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities offers both rose to $370-375/st fot, but saw less activity than farther south markets.\\nUrea (p)\\nPrompt prilled urea business has been limited following feed grade barge business netting back to about $300/st fob Nola two weeks ago.

The ammonia and urea units had been down since 17 May. Sorfert will load 3,000t granular urea for Helm, but larger sold cargoes will take more time as production ramps up. The AOA plant this week finished loading 30,000t granular urea for Ameropa destined for the Americas.\\n\\x84\\x84Keytrade is in the freight market for 35,000-40,000t of granular urea to load prompt in Oman for shipment to Nola, Brazil or Thailand.\\nUAN\\nFollowing east coast business as low as $216/t cfr and early business for Nola fill tons at $205/st fob Nola, prices in the US UAN market have stabilized and even moved higher.\\nThe lowest reported offers for fill tons are now $210/st fob Nola.

Trader opinions on the fill price are highly varied.\\nNew business has concluded for imports at $235/t cfr to two ports on the east coast for late-July or early-August arrival. That level is up just over $10/t from the last reported east coast business.\\nOffers for east coast imports have moved to $237/t cfr, but buyers’ price ideas have fallen back to the low-$230s/t cfr.\\nRiver terminals continue to drift lower as side dress season wraps up with prices in the range of $280-295/st fot. Those numbers are still well above prices implied by fill values, which are closer to $255/st fot.\\nReports indicate a Corn Belt UAN producer has issued a fill program at $245/st fot for loading in July through December.\\nAmmonium nitrate (p)\\nPrices are weakening in the AN market because of supply on the river and sputtering demand. Price indications this week moved to $260-265/st fob Nola, down by $8/st from last week. Buying interest is limited because of seasonality as well as fewer suppliers seeking to carry the product because of regulatory and safety concerns.\\nThe Nola AN assessment is at its lowest level on a midpoint basis since it launched in July 2012, beating the prior low of $267.50/st fob seen in November 2013. AN barge prices have dropped by more than $40/st since January 2015.\\nPrices in Tampa and the Mid South also fell this week to $330-340/st fot. Latest Inola/Catoosa prices are heard at $325/st fot.\\nwith some expecting flat prices to persist because of supply tightness.\\nUS exports of ammonium sulfate continue to trail last year\\'s pace, led by a fall in shipments from the Texas coast. The US exported 50,816t of amsul via vessel in April, down 39pc from a year ago and bringing the fertilizer year-to-date total to 837,412t, a 19pc fall year-over-year, according to customs data.\\nAmsul exports from Houston and Galveston, Texas, have been sharply lower this year, likely owing to Rentech Nitro- gen\\'s decision to focus less on exports and more on domestic sales from its Pasadena, Texas, plant. Exports from Texas ports for the fertilizer year-to-date are 211,939t, a 44pc drop from the same time last year. Texas ports exported just 6,600t of amsul in April, all of which went to Colombia.\\nExports from ports near Honeywell\\'s Hopewell, Virginia, plant — the US\\' largest with an estimated capacity of 1.8mn st/yr — have also dropped. Combined exports from Hopewell and nearby Norfolk, Virginia, are down 7pc year-over-year to 589,170t for the fertilizer year-to-date. In April, those ports exported 43,559t, with 20,754t to Senegal, 11,000t to Peru, 7,150t to the Dominican Republic and smaller lots to Brazil and Jamaica.\\nUS imports since last July have risen, but domestic produc- tion issues at several facilities and increased agronomic demand for amsul has kept supplies tight in 2015. The US has imported 389,283t of amsul from July-April, a 27pc increase year-over-year, with the total nearly an even split between China and Canada.\\nThe US imported 46,230t of amsul in April with 26,717t from China and 18,767t from Canada. Of the Chinese tonnage, 21,665t went to Vancouver, Washington, with 5,000t to New Orleans. For the fertilizer year-to-date, New Orleans has imported 112,319t of Chinese amsul, while Washington ports have received 86,877t.\\nUS net exports for the fertilizer year-to-date stand at 448,129t, nearly 300,000t lower year-over-year.\\nAmmonium sulfate (g)\\nCorn Belt amsul prices are stable at $310-320/st fot with tight supply preventing any moves down toward potential summer fill levels.

There were, however, some reports of more aggressive offers this week, though there were likely limited volumes concluded at these price levels.\\nThe most notable declines were at Oklahoma production points. One producer dropped offers to as low as $470/ st fot, down from about $525/st fot just last week. Other production sites held offers closer to $500/st fot. Although offers were significantly lower than last week, consensus among traders is that limited tons were sold at these values.\\nThe range of offers in the west Corn Belt has moved lower and widened. Asking prices are still as high as $595/st fot in northeast Iowa but have fallen to as low as $525/st near the Iowa-Nebraska border. Further sidedress consumption in that area is expected to be limited with most of these applica- tions done with UAN.\\nHigher numbers in the east Corn Belt have receded, with prevailing offers now in the range of $600-620/st. Offers are higher moving east, with limited business done at $620/st fot in Indiana.\\nSome of the crop, particularly in the east Corn Belt, has only now reached the emergence stage, which should bode well for further summer consumption. At least one supplier has recently moved new tons to East Corn Belt terminals via barge.\\nInternational ammonia highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Reports indicate that Koch will sublet the Gas Grouper for about 60 days from Ameropa.

Demand in the region is picking up with Trammo selling a cargo to India’s SPIC at a reported price of $450/t cfr.\\nPhosphate\\nMinimal activity marked the US phosphate market this week, with spring demand having ended, save for some pockets in southern areas.\\nDAP prices are mostly flat, with June barge business con- cluding this week at $420/st fob Nola, down by $3/st from trades last week. The paper market suggests that DAP Nola prices are near a floor, despite the imminent summer fill season, which typically coincides with a move lower in prices to stimulate demand ahead of the fall application season. Nola’s discount relative to other global markets makes a rush of imports unlikely over coming months, creating the percep- tion of limited downside price risk. Third quarter paper bids and offers continue to hover around the $420/st fob Nola.\\nProducer offers for physical June/July DAP barges continue to be indicated from $425-430/st fob Nola, but buying inter- est is minimal. Mosaic reported continued truck sales in Central Florida at $430/st fot.\\nIn imports, Morocco’s OCP plans to ship at least one cargo to the US in July, with additional vessels possible if there is a delay in the settlement of the third quarter phosphoric acid price. The Moroccan imports are likely despite Nola DAP prices standing at more than a $40/t discount relative to Mo-\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nroccan asking prices. Moroccan offers into Brazil range from $505-515/t cfr, depending on port, while Nola prices equate to the high-$460s/t cfr.\\nMosaic reported small lots of export business for July ship- ment this week within the prevailing $471-475t fob Tampa range.\\nDAP/MAP\\nThe US phosphate market traded thinly this week, with a pair of June-loading domestic DAP barges selling at $420/st fob Nola accounting for all confirmed business. The DAP Nola assessment is adjusted to $418-420/st fob, down by $3/st on the high end. There were no confirmed MAP barge trades, but that product remains widely discussed at a $5-10/st pre- mium to DAP. The MAP assessment is lowered to $425-430/st fob Nola as a result.\\nPhosphate warehouse prices crept downward this week on flagging demand, with offers now standing at $450-455/st fot in St Louis, Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities. The Inola/Catoosa DAP assessment is unchanged at $460-465/st fot, with suppliers there not motivated to lower offers given fresh supply cannot reach that market until the Arkansas river reopens fully to navigation (see Freight section). MAP warehouse assessments remain at a $5/st premium to DAP.\\nBrazil imports latest\\nBrazilian MAP imports fell by a third in the first five months of this year, according to latest GTIS statistics, as poor farmer economics, a weak Real and high inventories from the fourth quarter continued to take their toll. However, May imports have rallied strongly as the season approaches.\\nImports of MAP in May hit 263,003t, up nearly 170,000t on the previous month, following a buying spree and price ap- preciation in April.\\n0\\n— US Department of Commerce\\nIssue 15-23\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 11 June 2015\\nUS phosphate import tracker\\nPhosphate barge business\\nOf the total, 102,936t were sourced from Russia, through direct sales and via traders. Chinese MAP accounted for 65,511t, with US material recording 56,373t.\\nYear-to-date imports have reached 709,228t, down 33.5pc. Russia formed the largest share at 254,868t, down a third on the same period of 2014. The US was second with 168,688t, up 7.4pc. OCP Morocco\\'s decision to switch away from Brazil in the first quarter is still reflected in the numbers, with only 114,874t moved, down 61.7pc. China accounted for 109,403t, up 6.3pc.\\nDAP imports for the calendar year to date are down by slightly less at 239,706t, a fall of 25.6pc. The US has been the largest supplier with 149,931t, down 32.5pc year-on-year. Russia is some way behind in second with 35,525t.

ICL said the fire had been extinguished the same day, with employees suffering minor smoke-related injuries. The company is evaluating the dam- age. The facility produces 600,000 t/yr TSP as well as SSP. The US has imported 49,430t of TSP from Israel over the first four months of 2015 and imported 107,425t for all of 2014.\\nPotash\\nThe US potash barge market weakened this week as prices move lower in advance of summer fill pricing.\\nMultiple domestic potash barges traded from $315-320/st fob Nola, with one wholesaler seeing decent retail demand at the high end of that range. Other suppliers indicated offers from $320-325/st fob Nola. Overall buying interest remains limited as the market transitions to the summer fill period, with nearby demand largely confined to the Delta and mid- south, where planting activities are ongoing.\\nThe Nola barge assessment is nearing its lowest level since it launched in July 2012. The assessment’s midpoint reached $311-312/st fob Nola in January 2014 before rallying by more than $60/st over the next eight months.\\nCorn Belt prices are largely unchanged on stagnant demand. The low end of the Corn Belt assessment is adjusted slightly down to $360-375/st fot. A move lower could be in the cards with Nola barges trading at $315/st fob Nola, which suggests\\nCorn Belt terminal prices near $350/st fot, depending on exact location.\\nBuyers have identified that the $350/st fot Corn Belt level could be a price that inspires summer fill demand. Domes- tic producers have yet to come out with official summer pricing. Expectations are for new prices to be unveiled by early July. Until then, producers are focused on replenishing inland warehouses and building consignment stocks ahead of fill demand. Rail volumes for potash over the last month have been higher than historical averages, according to one shipper.\\nInternational potash highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, June business for granular MOP continues to conclude at $330-335/t cfr with forward values showing strength. Producer offers for July deliveries stand at $340/t cfr, with August pegged at $350/t cfr, nearly in line with current Nola values.\\n\\x84\\x84In Israel, ICL is focused on loading 50,000t vessels of standard MOP to fulfill its supply contracts, with Chinese customers following the recent resolution of the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations. Standard MOP shipments were able to resume immediately because of on-hand inventory stored outside. Granular MOP, which degrades if left in open air, inventory must be rebuilt, with shipments unlikely to resume until second-half June at the earliest.\\n\\x84\\x84ICL also has two cargoes of standard MOP scheduled for shipment to India, despite the producer having no formal supply deal in place. ICL is expected to negotiate supply contracts with Indian buyers soon. Once concluded, India will have an estimated 4.5mn-4.7mn t MOP firm committed through contracts with options to raise the total to 5mn- 5.2mn t.\\nUS MOP imports\\nJan 14 Apr 14 Jul 14 Oct 14 Jan 15 Apr 15\\n— US Department of Commerce\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nGlobal sulfur prices\\nIssue 15-23\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 11 June 2015\\nsince December 2014.\\nInternational sulfur highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Saudi Arabia, Aramco Trading\\'s July lifting price for sulfur to term customers has been announced at $144/t fob, a rise of $2/t on June.\\nSulfuric acid\\nThe MTM Houston has been fixed to load 19,000t of sulfuric acid in Sweden or Finland 1-10 July and will discharge on the US east coast. The vessel did not impact the US spot sulfuric acid assessment, which was unchanged at $70-80/t cfr for the 26th week.\\nSulfur and sulfuric acid\\nSulfur\\nSyncrude halted sulfur shipments 8 June from its facilities in Alberta because of high levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), continuing the issues that have hindered the oil consortium for two months. Syncrude had restarted shipments around 11 May after stopping them in mid-April, but had to curtail loading again on 22 May. Shipments had resumed 26 May before being stopped again this week.\\nThe US has been able to make up from less Canadian imports with its own supply. The US produced 2.8mn t of sulfur the first four months this year, compared to 2.7mn t in 2014. The increase in production has come despite the boom in light US crude production, as refinery rates reach record highs. Refinery utilization in the US Gulf coast reached 98.4pc the week ended 5 June, the highest figure since the EIA started tracking that data in June 2010. Overall US refinery produc- tion was 94.6pc the week ended 5 June, the highest level\\nIt is understood that Teck’s Trail smelter in British Colum- bia – a key source of supply in the Pacific Northwest – has a turnaround planned in June, though the extent and timing of the work is unclear. The facility produces around 42,000 t/month of sulfuric acid, which is marketed by International Raw Materials (IRM).\\nFurthermore, Sherritt International has a planned main- tenance scheduled for the second quarter this year at its cobalt refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. There have been discussions that the plant has had sulfuric acid sup- ply disruptions in recent weeks. The facility’s 208,000 t/yr sulfuric acid production is marketed by Chemtrade.\\nInternational sulfuric acid highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, Paranapanema is increasing the nameplate capacity at its Dias d\\'Avila sulfuric acid plant in Bahia state by 30,000t/yr to 600,000-650,000t/yr in 2015. Operations will be impacted by the work, and the company is currently in the market for supply to meet contractual commitments with clients.\\nFertilizer news\\nWet weather boosts wheat production: USDA\\nLate-season rains will boost US wheat yields and production this year, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\\nThe June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report projected the US will produce 2.1bn bushels of wheat in 2015, up by 95mn bushel from last year. While the area planted will fall by 1.4mn acres year-over-year to 55.4mn acres in 2015, yields will jump to 44.2 bushels/acre from 43.5 bushels/acre in 2014.\\nThe rise in production will also boost ending stocks of wheat by 21mn bushels year-over-year to 814mn bushels in 2015, the highest total since the 2010 crop season. The expected uptick in supply weighed on projected average farm prices for wheat, which fell 10¢/bushel on the low and high end to $4.40-5.40/bushel for 2015, down from $6/bushel in 2014.\\nJuly wheat futures prices dropped after the data.

The higher supply forecast stems from higher beginning stocks, which are expected to total 1.9bn bushels in 2015, up from 1.2bn bushels last year. US corn production (13.6bn bushels), yields (166.8 bushels/ acre) and ethanol use (5.2bn bushels) are all unchanged from last month\\'s WASDE.\\nThe projected 2015 average farm price for corn was also unchanged at $3.20-3.80/bushel, compared to the 2014 esti- mate of $3.55-3.75/bushel.

Higher begin- ning stocks will buoy soybean supply, jumping 238mn bushels year-over-year to 330mn bushels. Ending soybean stocks will jump 145mn bushels to 475mn bushels in 2015.\\nThe projected 2015 average farm price for soybeans was unchanged from last month at $8.25-9.75/bushel, compared to the 2014 estimate of $10.05/bushel. Front-month soybeans prices fell as much as 7¢/bushel to a low of $9.44/bushel in midday trading.\\nGlobal soybean production will fall a slight 670,000t (26.4mn bushels) year-over-year to 317.6mn t in 2015 on lower output from China, Paraguay and the US. Global soybean use will rise, however, jumping 11.7mn t (461mn bushels) year-over- year to 305.6mn t. Despite lower projected production, global ending stocks will climb to 96.2mn t in 2015, com- pared to 83.7mn t in 2014.\\nUS crop conditions stable after floods\\nThe impact on crops from heavy storms and flooding two weeks ago were still negligible for the week ended 7 June, with no crops sustaining major setbacks, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.\\nOverall winter wheat condition was rated 30pc good or\\nexcellent, with 20pc of the crop rated poor or very poor, unchanged from the previous week. Kansas (29pc), Nebraska (33pc) and South Dakota (37pc) showed the largest amount of wheat rated poor or very poor, while 11 of the top 18 pro- ducing states reported at least 50pc rated good or excellent.\\nThe inclement weather did delay harvests for winter wheat, which is 4pc finished, eight percentage points down from the five-year average. Harvesting in Texas (20pc) and Oklahoma (13pc) showed effects from the heavy storms, falling 10 percentage points and 24 percentage points behind their respective averages.\\nFront-month wheat prices reflected concerns for worse con- ditions, climbing for the seventh straight day. July futures prices settled 7 June at $5.28/bushel, the highest value since 2 April.\\nSpring wheat conditions were also stable, rating 69pc good or excellent, down just two percentage points from last week and the same time last year. Spring wheat was 97pc emerged, well ahead of its 80pc five-year average.\\nThe number of days suitable for fieldwork was markedly im- proved the week ended 7 June, with most states in the Corn Belt and south showing at a least a full day improvement.\\nThe biggest gains were made in Illinois (4.6), Iowa (4.3), Kan- sas (4.1), Louisiana (5.1), Missouri (2.0) and Oklahoma (4.6).\\nCorn conditions were stable at 74pc good or excellent, unchanged from last week and one percentage point ahead of the same week last year. Texas (10pc), Kansas (13pc) and Missouri (12pc) were the only states to report 10pc or more of corn in poor or very poor condition. Twelve of the top 18 producing states reported at least 70pc of corn in good or excellent condition.\\nUS corn was 91pc emerged, up slightly from the five-year average of 90pc. Colorado (72pc), Kansas (79pc) and North Dakota (72pc) were the only states to report less than 85pc of corn emerged.\\nSoybean plantings continued to lag behind the five-year average, likely because of wet weather limiting fieldwork. Plantings are 79pc finished the week ended 7 June, two per- centage points behind the average. Planting completions in Kansas (31pc) and Missouri (30pc) are 45 percentage points and 39 percentage points behind their respective averages. Soybeans are 64pc emerged, however, one percentage point ahead of the five-year average.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nCotton conditions were rated 50pc good or excellent the week ended 7 June, the first week reported by the USDA. Just 7pc of overall cotton was rated poor, with none rated very poor.\\nGrain shippers, railroads debate rates\\nGrain shippers say they face skyrocketing rates and an un- workable process for challenging them, but railroads say one commodity should not receive special treatment and that rates are reasonable and market-based.\\nShippers and railroads outlined their sharply differing views to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) this week at a public hearing that had railroads defending their treatment of grain shippers. STB acting chairwoman Deb Miller has pub- licly acknowledged that bringing a rate case to the board is too long and expensive and she wants to reform the board’s processes.\\nAt the hearing in Washington DC, board members asked detailed questions and heard from a diverse set of market participants concerning the situation facing grain shippers. STB appears focused on making changes, but railroads are digging in on the issue of carving out any special rules for the sector.\\nGrain shippers are unsure whether they have standing to bring a case, making them even more hesitant to bring rate cases to the board. Unlike a commodity such as coal, there is no regulatory history and precedent from which shippers and railroads can determine whether a certain rate is fair, witnesses said. Railroads argue that no rate cases have been brought because rates are already fair.\\nUS Department of Agriculture deputy under secretary Gary Woodward encouraged STB to simplify rate cases, lower costs for shippers, and increase use of mediation and arbi- tration to resolve rate disputes. While railroads talk about efficiency gains on the system through massive capital investment, grain shippers argue that rising rates do not reflect that enhanced efficiency. There is benefit for every- body if railroads earn sufficient returns on their investments, but the natural monopolies they represent call for change, Woodward said.\\nAmerican Association of Railroads (AAR) counsel Timothy Strafford argued that STB’s processes are accessible, point- ing out its Rail Customer and Public Assistance Program that gives the public informal access to staff and voluntary resolution of rail service issues. STB has lowered filing fees\\nand increased limits on simplified cases, he said.\\nThere is “no reason to craft special rate reasonableness rules for grain shippers,” he said.\\nThe three benchmark methodology “is already a frail sys- tem,” he said, referring to an STB process that compares the markup on the challenged rate to the average markup assessed on other comparable traffic.\\nThe board also uses the “stand-alone cost” test which says the rate being contested cannot be higher than the rate a hypothetical efficient railroad would need to charge while fully covering its costs. This process is seen as cumbersome because it requires shippers to construct a hypothetical railroad.\\nWith both processes under fire, it appears likely STB will take action on grain rates. But it faces a delicate balance in serving the interests of bother shippers and railroads.\\nTexas governor signs fertilizer bill into law\\nTexas governor Greg Abbott on 9 June signed to law a bill that will create guidelines for the storage and inspection of ammonium nitrate.\\nHouse Bill 942 is a response to the fertilizer explosion in West, Texas, two years ago that killed 15 people. The legis- lation will authorize fire marshals to inspect facilities storing ammonium nitrate and creates strict reporting guidelines for housing the fertilizer. The regulations will take effect 1 September 2016.\\nAmmonium nitrate imports into the US have dropped since the West explosion, with some suppliers opting not to carry the product because of regulatory and safety concerns. US ammonium nitrate imports the first four months of the year were 207,030t, down 5.9pc from the same period in 2014 and 37.8 from 2013.\\nFire erupts at Pennsylvania plant\\nA fire broke out and engulfed a fertilizer warehouse just outside Hanover, Pennsylvania, in the early morning 8 June, forcing local officials to monitor water contamination and urge local residents to stay indoors.\\nA building at Miller Chemical and Fertilizer’s facility in Cone- wago Township caught fire around 3:30 am 8 June and was destroyed by late morning.

The line runs north into Mis- souri, where it branches west into Nebraska and east into Illinois and Indiana.\\nTetco: Arkansas river nat gas line detached\\nA 400ft segment of a natural gas pipeline which leaked in the Arkansas river on 31 May broke away and was pushed downstream, said Spectra Energy, the owner and operator of the line.\\nThe pipeline — which serves as a back up to the Texas East- ern Transmission (Tetco) mainline — was not in service at the time of the leak but about 3.9mn cf (110,370 m³) of gas was released.\\nSonar surveys showed that the 400ft segment of the pipeline traveled downstream from its original location and lies along the north bank of the Arkansas river. The nearest end of the pipe segment appears to be about 100ft downstream from the original pipeline crossing.\\nSpectra said it is developing plans to remove the disconnect- ed pipe for inspection as soon as river conditions permit.\\nThe 31 May incident caused the US Coast Guard to close a\\n2-mile section of the Arkansas river between mile markers 116 to 118, as the river experienced high water levels. The section re-opened on the evening of 5 June.\\nSpectra also isolated the Tetco mainline in the same area as a precaution. \"The mainline is intact and was operating properly after the incident,\" Spectra said.\\nSonar surveys showed that about 450ft of the Tetco mainline is partially uncovered in the riverbed. Spectra said that it is taking steps to verify the integrity of the mainline prior to placing it back into operation.\\nThe back-up line was inspected in 2012 for corrosion or mechanical damage and no areas of concern were identi- fied, Spectra said. The US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration requires this type of inspection — known as an in-line inspection — every seven years.\\nIn addition, Spectra said that it conducted a diver survey in 2011 to evaluate the depth of riverbed soil over the mainline and the auxiliary line and found no areas of concern, includ- ing no exposed pipeline.\\nSenate challenge to EPA water rules advances\\nThe US Senate Environment and Public Works committee ap- proved a bill on 10 June aimed at blocking the Environmen- tal Protection Agency (EPA) and US Army Corps of Engineers from promulgating newly finalized rules on waters protected by the Clean Water Act.\\nThe Federal Water Quality Protection Act (S 1140) would force EPA and the corps to withdraw their rules and rewrite them after doing further consultation with state and local governments. It now awaits a vote by the full Senate.\\nA separate bill blocking the new rules passed the House of Representatives last month but the White House has threat- ened to veto it.\\nEPA and the corps released the final rules on 27 May, intend- ing to clarify what types of waterways are governed by the federal Clean Water Act.

The agencies also claim to have carefully reviewed the more than 1mn comments received between the time they initially proposed changes and when the rule was finalized.\\n\"No matter what concessions EPA has claimed, they added new provisions that greatly expand their authority,\" bill sponsor senator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) said at today\\'s hearing. \"It is possible to have reasonable regulations that help preserve our waterways while still protecting the dif- ference between state waters and federal waters.\"\\nCommittee ranking member Barbara Boxer (D-California) and others were strongly opposed to the bill. But proposed amendments to soften it were not passed.\\n\"We should not be tearing apart the Clean Water Act,\" Boxer said. \"Instead of advancing a bill that would allow more pol- lution of our waterways we should listen to the wide variety of stakeholders that support\" the new rules. She said a poll taken last month said 78pc of people think Congress should allow the rule to move forward.\\nUS biofuel mandates will rely on biodiesel: EIA\\nUS biofuel blending mandates proposed in late May and pub- lished in the federal register today do little to increase the use of higher ethanol fuels but will significantly lift biodies- el, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\\nEIA\\'s interpretation of the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s (EPA) proposed 2015 and 2016 blending volumes explain why only biodiesel groups greeted the measures with applause when they were introduced 29 May, as well as why there was a sharp drop in prices for ethanol credits used to comply with the mandates.\\nNested blending volumes set out each year under the Re- newable Fuel Standard (RFS) require refiners, importers and other companies to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into the US transportation fuel supply.\\nProposed requirements for biodiesel would lift consumption of that fuel by 11pc this year and 21pc in 2016 compared to 2014 volumes.\\n\"EIA expects the biggest effect of the proposed RFS targets to be on biomassed-based diesel consumption,\" the agency said in a short-term energy outlook published yesterday.\\nBut ethanol consumption will only measurably increase with consumer access and interest in higher-ethanol gasoline fuels\\nthat many US retailers may not physically or legally provide, a problem called the blend wall.\\nA forecast decline in gasoline demand — by 20,000 b/d next year, according to the EIA — will chip away at ethanol blend- ing without increased sales of mid-level and high-ethanol gasoline blends called E15 and E85.\\nUS ethanol output reaches six-month high: EIA\\nUS ethanol production increased 2pc to 992,000 b/d in the week ended 5 June, marking the highest output seen since December 2014, according to the Energy Information Admin- istration.\\nTotal ethanol production was up 20,000 b/d from the\\n972,000 b/d seen last week, marking five consecutive weeks of increases in output.

Offer prices for the first 400,000t of DAP ranged $479-491/t cfr but there is some un- certainty over what basis the offers were made. Additionally, while most offers appear to be ex-China, it seems clear not all offers have been backed. In the TSP tender, OCP looks likely to be awarded around 75,000t in the low-$400s/t fob with some Lebanese and Bulgarian TSP in the mix. In terms of deals done, OCP reports the sale of 240,000t MAP to Bra- zil at a stable $500/t cfr. In the east, Pakistan has taken a Saudi DAP cargo in the low-$480s/t cfr while Chinese DAP is also understood to have been sold at a similar level. Around 100,000t of DAP ex-China has been sold to India in the high- $470s/$480/t cfr range.\\nOutlook: stable to firm\\nHeadlines\\n\\x84\\x84Bangladesh DAP/TSP tender offers lack clarity \\x84\\x84Pakistan takes more DAP cargoes\\n\\x84\\x84Mosaic sells DAP/MAP/MES at $471-475/t fob\\nView the methodology used to assess phosphate prices at www.argusmedia.com/methodology.

Prices have not done any- thing and look stable with more upside likely than downside given Brazilian and Indian subcontinental demand coalesc- ing. But upside is limited and most expect the market to peak early in Q3. Producers seem more keen on volume over price currently. The only anomaly is the low-priced US domestic market which has disconnected from global pric- ing, prompting the question of how much the market could import in 2H 2015.\\nIn Latin America, OCP and traders with MAP positions have maintained prices around $500/t cfr, as indicated last week.\\nThe volume placed by OCP – 240,000t for June – is high. With considerable trader length still evident on Chinese and Rus- sian product, the ability to push prices up further is limited. With 2H July availability from China uncertain due to time constraints, producers may be hopeful of pushing up 11-52 prices next month as Brazil faces less supply options. Most consider $510-515/t cfr at most as achievable.\\nElsewhere, the Bangladesh DAP tender has been in the spot- light all week following the release of offers which, quite frankly, have left the industry confused in terms of which offers had been backed and on what basis they were made. Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the offers are understood to be offered ex-China but it is pretty clear not all of the offers have backing. Argus FMB understands that the first 120,000t of DAP offers at the lowest price of roughly $480/t cfr were backed by Hubei Dongsheng at $460/t fob. The next round of offers reflect $470/t fob assuming backing is found while some Chinese producers have indicated backing a price around $480/t fob, though it is highly unlikely awards would be made at that latter level given the volume offered below this level.\\nRegardless, with Chinese DAP offers now firming, it seems clear that some Chinese producers have used this tender to send a signal to India and Bangladesh on their position in the coming months. This strategy is likely to have been adopted with the upcoming rabi import demand in mind. Although a strong line-up for India, decent commitments for Southeast Asia, emerging demand from Pakistan and likely awards from the Bangladesh tender will all have played a role in support- ing this strategy.\\nWhilst the Chinese will push for higher numbers, the India cfr price will likely be dependent on several other factors in- cluding the current maximum retail price (MRP), movements of the rupee and the strength of the monsoon, none of the recent developments on which are particularly encouraging. For now, the Indians appear to be mostly covered for the kharif season with DAP imports estimated to total around 2.4mn t during April-June. Another 3mn t or so is expected to be imported for the rabi season. India will return strongly in July and has still taken another 100,000t DAP this week at unchanged prices.\\nPakistan has also been active, with another Saudi DAP cargo placed into the market for June. Latest NFDC data would ap- pear to support the view that supplies will be pretty thin for end kharif, necessitating additional imports in Q3.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nIn the west, the market has been relatively calm with prices holding. The key focus in this region is the strength of de- mand in Brazil. It is clear that Brazil still needs to buy but concerns over crop pricing and the Brazilian real could ham- per this demand to an extent. In terms of pricing, suppliers appear to be maintaining current levels around $500/t cfr.\\nIn Turkey, importers are switching to 20-20-0 from DAP as it is a cheaper option while the indefinite outage at GCT will also have likely pushed buyers to turn to alternatives. Up to 50,000t of 20-20-0 has reportedly been sold to various buy- ers in the last couple of weeks and DAP inquiries are few. GCT has restarted some rock mining, but no meaningful DAP supply will hit the market until July at the earliest.\\nLooking forward, we maintain our view that the market will be stable-to-firm through Q3 supported by continuing buying in Latin America and India.

Offers for domestic DAP for prompt/June loading fell from $423/st fob Nola to $418-420/ st as the week progressed, down from last week’s high trade of $427/st fob Nola. Forward physical prices showed further weakness with August-loading domestic DAP offered at $418/ st fob Nola and September trading at $416/st fob.\\nWith the US undervalued compared to other global markets, it is unlikely to attract a score of imports like last third quar- ter.

Moreover, domestic DAP/MAP demand is weak due to poor wheat prices while reports of domestic DAP/MAP prices providing an equivalent import price of $470-485/t cfr are also discouraging import- ers from purchasing at current levels in the low-$500s/t cfr.\\nLatest GTIS data shows that Argentinean MAP deliveries in April were up by 55pc year-on-year to 34,377t, of which 17,417t was sourced from Saudi Arabia while 16,900t came from China.\\nMAP imports during January-April also increased, by 20pc, to 95,519t from the 79,887t recorded in the corresponding period of 2014. China was the primary source during this period shipping 53,648t to Argentina, thanks largely to the introduction of a year-round flat export tax rate. Saudi Ara- bian MAP accounted for 24,317t, 11,548t originated in the US and 5,843t came from Russia.\\nDAP imports in April rose by 87pc year-on-year to 10,822t, the bulk of which was supplied from Saudi Arabia (10,776t).\\nDAP imports during the first four months of 2015, however, decreased by 27pc to 43,724t compared with 60,191t in the corresponding period of the previous year. Again, the majority of the deliveries were sourced from Saudi Arabia (36,799t) while 6,825t originated in the US.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nBrazil\\nMAP 11-52-0 is offered at $500/t cfr for discharge at Para- nagua and Rio Grande. Up to six unsold handysized vessels of MAP 11-52-0 ex-FSU and Chinese MAP 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 are uncommitted for late June to early July delivery. Suppli- ers are hopeful that once import activity begins, these will quickly be committed.\\nAmeropa has yet to sell the balance of 8,000t off its vessel, which is on the water, carrying a total of 30,000t of Austra- lian MAP for arrival at Paranagua in late June. It is targeting $500/t cfr Paranagua and is reported to have achieved close to this level.\\nOCP is indicating sales of MAP 11-52-0 totalling 240,000t of MAP 11-52-0 for June shipment to various importers, with one cargo for its own system, expected to be placed in a bonded warehouse at Paranagua. OCP indicates the sales were concluded at $500/t cfr Paranagua.\\nKoch is placing 22,000t MAP from its May PhosAgro vessel into a bonded warehouse. The vessel arrived 31 May but will not berth until 25 June. Reports indicate a very small lot was sold off this vessel to Utilfertil at around $500/t cfr.\\nPart-cargoes of MAP 11-44-0 have traded this week in the very high-$390s/t cfr Paranagua. Trammo and Mekatrade are linked as the suppliers. A cargo of 10,000t of Chinese MAP 11-44-0 for June loading has reportedly traded at $400/t cfr Porto Alegre, equating to around $390/t cfr Paranagua. Unifertil is linked as the importer but the purchase could not be confirmed with the buyer.\\nA total of 90,000t of Moroccan TSP to be shipped in three- to-four lots in June has been sold to various importers at $400/t cfr Paranagua.\\nOverall, there was not a great deal of trading activity reported this week after a major international fertilizer con- ference last week and a national public holiday on 4 June. The government announced this week a farm credit package worth R$188bn ($60.4bn) for 2015/2016, 20pc higher than the previous program, effective from 1 July, to fund farm investments and to finance costs of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers. Farmers have begun making enquiries and next round of inland buying appears to be imminent. Expectation is that importers will finally return to the international mar- ket once inland fertilizer purchasing begins in earnest.\\nMexico\\nFertinal will ship 35,000-40,000t of DAP/MAP/TSP to Chile in the first half of June. Also for June, it has allocated a parcel to a trader with optional destinations including Bra- zil, Argentina and the US while some phosphates will also be shipped to Central America with the balance going to Mexico.\\nMexican DAP exports in March totalled 16,378t compared with 18,451t in March 2014, according to latest GTIS statis- tics. Of this total, 8,900t went to Ecuador while 6,700t was shipped to Australia.\\nOn MAP, exports totalled 28,435t in March compared with 64,425t in the same month of the previous year.

This both makes imports potentially more expen- sive and puts pressure on sellers to raise the MRP above the Rs 24,000/t threshold. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is hard to achieve currently, given ample supply and a late start to the kharif season. There is concern about how where the MRP settles. With the Rupee volatile importers are taking a short-term approach to buying. Some reports indicate demand for August is currently pretty thin.\\nIn reality the lack of an official notification on the DAP subsidy is likely a technicality and importing will continue once the DoF makes announcement. Sources in India hint at delays to announcement being on account of some states ex- pressing concern over availability constraints in view of the proposed freight reimbursement to industry/importers.\\nContradictory messages are being sent as regards the performance of the monsoon and the likely impact of any El Nino effect. At this stage it is still too early to tell. The traditional landfall of the monsoon over Kerala has been delayed and is now forecast to hit the region later this week according to the Indian Meteorological Department. Overall, total rainfall is now forecast to be \"deficient\", that is 88pc of normal according to a government statement. However, this only applies to total rainfall, and regional impacts are still hard to gauge.\\nPakistan\\nMa\\'aden has sold 25,000t of DAP in the mid-$480s/t cfr for June loading. The buyer is understood to be PakArab. It has now raised its offers to the $490s/t cfr for a mid/late-June cargo.\\nReports of a second Saudi DAP cargo sold this week have yet to be confirmed.\\nIt is widely reported that Quantum has sold a 35,000-40,000t cargo of Chinese DAP to Chawla for early June loading - this had variously previously been reported as being of Australian origin but never confirmed - also in the low-$480s/t cfr.\\nDAP offtake rose in April at the start of the kharif season to 68,000t, a rise of nearly 53pc year on year. Production exactly matched offtake at the Fauji plant with 68,000t reported. Imports hit 38,000t. With an opening stock of 139,000t, total availability was 544,000t. NFDC estimates total demand at 618,000t which indicates some shortfall in supply of 74,000t to be met with imports. However, the NFDC data shows no imports for May onwards and does not\\nIssue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015\\ntake account of various purchases made in May and early June which would eradicate the shortfall. Even so, supply is forecast to be thin for the onset of rabi and significant purchasing will begin again in July to build stocks.\\nBangladesh\\nThe Bangladesh government tender for 400,000t DAP for Q3 supply which closed on 31 May attracted 53 offers from local importers for a total volume of 1.556mn t.\\nPrices (on a cfr plus bags, bagging and l/c charges basis) for all offers ranged $479-534.14/t. Prices for the first 400,000t ranged $479-491/t.\\nHubei Dongsheng backed the first three importers at $479- 481/t cfr.

Xianfang is backing local importers at $490.25/t cfr which would take total offers to 400,000t. The tender is understood to be awarded in price ascending order until the total volume is secured.

There was considerable con- fusion as to where offers were, and on what basis they were made. Argus FMB understands that the first 120,000t of DAP offers at the lowest roughly $480/t cfr price were backed by Hubei Dongsheng at $460/t fob. These are the lowest offers by $10/t. The next round of offers reflect $470/t fob assuming backing is found. There seems little doubt that the majority of Chinese producers want to send a message to the Indian and Bangladeshi markets, and there is talk this week of offers as high as $480/t fob. In part this is designed for Indian consumption ahead of rabi import demand, but in reality India, given its current MRP, Rupee and monsoon concerns, is unlikely to move off the $480s/t cfr.\\nIn truth, Chinese suppliers are comfortable. The June line up for India is substantial. Add at least 150,000t of DAP likely to ship to Bangladesh plus sales to southeast Asia and it is easy to argue suppliers are not under pressure.\\nIn terms of actual business this week, YUC is understood to have sold a total of 67,000t of DAP to Southeast Asia at\\n$475-478/t fob for June shipment. Wengfu reports selling 3,000t DAP to Vietnam in the high-$480s/t cfr, reflecting around $470/t fob. It also reports selling 6,000t DAP to Thailand at a similar netback and 50,000t DAP to India in the mid/high-$460s/t fob.\\nLiven has meanwhile reportedly sold 50,000t Chinese DAP into India in the high-$470s/t cfr reflecting the mid-$460s/t fob China.\\nYUC has completed maintenance at its plant and is now in the process of ramping up production. During May, the pro- ducer was operating at around 50pc capacity but increase this to 80pc by next week. In June, it will produce DAP as well as 11-52 and 10-50 MAP.\\nOn MAP, there is some 11-44 MAP available for July ship- ment, but concerns continue about going long on product loading July for arrival into Brazil. Traders say product is available in the low-$370s/t fob all the way up to $380/t fob. Most availability is for 2H July shipment. 10-50 prices are reported in a wide range from $410-430/t fob. One trader reports taking a position at $425/t fob for June.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nJapan\\nAccording to latest GTIS figures, Japanese DAP imports in April fell by 57pc year-on-year to 8,140t.

OCP had been thought likely to be awarded around 96,000t in a $460-466.79/t cfr range but the Moroccan producer has since advised it may receive an award for 75,000t. One cargo of Lebanese was offered at $463/t cfr and another at $473/t cfr totalling 60,000t. The netback is estimated to be in the $405-410/t fob range. A total of 20,000-50,000t will be sourced from Tunisia (Salakta) at $473/t cfr and with Mexican possibly dis-\\nqualified Agropolychim Bulgaria completes the 200,000t line up at $474.90/t cfr. However, no award has officially been made and this is expected on Sunday 7 June.\\nMorocco\\nThe netback from the likely awards in the Bangladesh tender are in the low-$400s/t fob allowing for $35-40/t freight and other costs. OCP reports it will likely be awarded around 75,000t, not the 96,000t previously reported. There are also two cargoes of TSP booked for July-September to BADC under the government-to-government agreement. Shipment may not start until July given the 90,000t booked for Brazil at $400/t cfr (netting the mid/high-$380s/t fob) and 12- 15,000t booked for European destinations.\\nUruguay\\nA trader is understood to have sold 10,000t of Mexican TSP to Uruguay at $395-400/t cfr for June shipment.\\nChina\\nWengfu reports selling 5,000 TSP to Japan at $390/t fob.\\nNPK\\nTurkey\\nTurkish buyers appear to be favouring 20-20-0 over DAP due to its more attractive pricing while concerns over limited DAP supply following the outage at GCT is also playing a role in the switch.\\nAtrader has reportedly sold 6,000-10,000t of Greek 20-20-0 to a buyer at a price around $330/t cfr. The same trader is also thought to have sold 10,000t of Russian 20-20-0 to the same buyer. No price has been indicated for the latter sale.\\nGubretas has also reportedly taken 25,000t of Greek 20-20-0 while Vertiqual is understood to have sold 6,000t to Turkey.

This represents a 71pc year-on-year rise in rouble terms which has been supported by an improved pric- ing environment along with significant rouble depreciation. In particular, revenues were supported by higher average pricing for DAP/MAP and NPK exports, which were up by more than 96pc and 81pc respectively in rouble terms.\\nIts sales of phosphate-based products during the quar- ter increased by 7pc year-on-year to RUB42,860mn and by 5pc in volume terms. Specifically, revenue generated from DAP/MAP exports increased by 139pc year-on-year to RUB21,113mn. A further breakdown shows that revenues from MAP exports rose by 62pc year-on-year and those from DAP exports increased by 443pc.\\nThe producer’s earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) also saw a significant increase, up 186pc, from RUB8,587mn to RUB24,590 mn while net profit increased by an impressive 64pc to RUB14,164mn.\\nCommenting on the outlook, PhosAgro\\'s chairman and CEO Andrey Guryev said: \"Looking ahead, I believe supply-de- mand fundamentals will be supportive of DAP prices.

In China, a producer reports the sale of 60,000t DAP to India at $468-470/t fob while Wengfu reports the sale of MAP at $480/t fob for Latin America. Sabic has sold DAP to Pakistan’s United Agro in the mid-$480s/t cfr while Fauji is inquiring for 30,000-40,000t DAP for July ship- ment.

Sup- pliers on the whole are comfortable and those with unsold tonnes, particularly for Latin America, do not feel under pressure in anticipation of further seasonal demand emerg- ing. On the demand side, India and Latin America remain the focus although trade activity in India has slowed slightly on adequate supply for the kharif season.\\nBangladesh’s DAP/TSP tender continues to hold the market’s attention this week. Uncertainty remains over the level of\\nproducer backing for DAP but letters of credit have been requested to be opened by today, 11 June, which should pro- vide a clearer indication of who will take what and at what prices. The awards are expected to be confirmed in the next couple of weeks before shipping commences late June/ early July. As it stands, if all those invited open l/cs, then it seems that China will mop up almost all the 400,000t DAP that Bangladesh has tendered for while some have indicated that Australian DAP could also be in the supply mix.\\nBased on this likely outcome, Chinese producers are set for a fairly comfortable Q3 against continued demand from India, Pakistan and Southeast Asia. Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time. Nevertheless, Chinese order books should be fairly full through to its domestic fall application season.\\nSo it is no surprise to see a slight firming in Chinese DAP prices to the mid-$460s/t fob minimum. This is in contrast to reports in India of buyers countering offers with lower numbers below the mid-$470s/t cfr on account of adequate supplies for June/July. It is estimated that India has booked close to 3 mn t during April-July. Moreover, concerns over the strength of the monsoon and a weak rupee are also playing a role in this downward price pressure being placed by the buyers. But in reality, barring a disastrous monsoon, suppliers know that India needs to buy another 2.5mn t this year. Factor in the additional demand from Saudi Arabia and China’s traditional demand markets during these next few months and an uptick in price seems more likely, albeit this will be limited and India pricing will depend on several key factors including the maximum retail price (MRP), the value of the Indian rupee and the strength of the monsoon.\\nElsewhere on the supply side, the Saudis have made a partial switch to MAP which will limit DAP supply for India and Pakistan while the Moroccans are sold out for June. OCP has yet to begin negotiations for July but has indicated that it intends to ship at least one cargo to the US, possibly more if the Q3 phosphoric acid price in India settles early – discus- sions begin next week.\\nTSP availability in the next few months is looking tight. OCP has around 150,000t committed to Bangladesh through to September and estimates that it will only have around 30,000t available for spot purchase during this time. More- over, a fire reported at ICL’s Rotem Amfert plant on 10 June could also impact ICL’s TSP/SSP output but it is too early to\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\ntell the extent of the damage. On top of this, uncertainty remains over GCT’s TSP output.\\nIn Latin America, prices are holding. Sales continue to be made at $500/t cfr in Brazil although offers have increased to $505-510/t cfr while Argentinean offers have risen to $510-515/t cfr. Some Chinese 11-52 has been sold in this region and more could be on its way with YUC switching partially to MAP 11-52 production. Availability of Chinese\\n10-50 and 11-44 in July, however, is uncertain due to time constraints with the shipping window likely to close around mid-July in order for the product to arrive in time in Latin America. The main concern here, however, is the strength of demand on account of a weak Brazilian Real as well as poor crop prices.\\nHighlights this week\\nSupply\\n\\x84\\x84ICL’s Amfert Rotem plant suffers fire…\\n\\x84\\x84…but impact on its TSP/SSP output unknown \\x84\\x84YUC begins producing 11-52 MAP\\n\\x84\\x84Indian April-July DAP line up close to 3 mn t\\nDemand\\n\\x84\\x84Pakistan buys Saudi DAP cargo\\n\\x84\\x84Fauji inquiring for 30-40,000t DAP \\x84\\x84Turkey takes 30,000t Moroccan DAP \\x84\\x84India’s RCF tenders for 75,000t DAP\\nPrices\\n\\x84\\x84Sabic sells DAP to Pakistan in the mid-$480s/t cfr \\x84\\x84Chinese DAP sells in the high-$460s/t fob to India \\x84\\x84Wengfu sells MAP 11-52 at $480/t fob\\n\\x84\\x84Morocco sells DAP to Turkey in the mid-$500s/t fob \\x84\\x84EuroChem sells Lifosa DAP at $500/t fob\\nthe phosphates world this week\\ndamage still being as-\\nsessed\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nMay/June/July 2015 phosphate tenders\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nMosaic has sold small lots of DAP/MAP to North and Central America at $471-475/t fob for July shipment.\\nDomestic\\nActivity has slowed with planting demand largely concluded and buyers assessing needs in advance of the fall season. June-loading domestic DAP traded at $420/st fob Nola on spotty demand for late-season applications in the south. Prices look flat heading into the third quarter with paper bids and offers hovering around the $420/st fob Nola level. Demand for physical barges is likely to remain seasonally limited, however downside price pressure is viewed to be minimal given Nola’s discount to global markets, which makes large quantities of imports unlikely in the near term. OCP, however, did indicate that it intend to ship at least one DAP/MAP cargo to the US in July.\\nCentral and Latin America\\nBrazil\\nSmall lots of up to 5,000t of MAP 11-52-0 ex-Morocco for June lifting have been sold at $500/t cfr Rio Grande and OCP has now upped its offer to $505/t cfr Rio Grande or Parana-\\ngua and to $510-515/t cfr Itaqui for product shipping in June and July.\\nUS sales totalling 25,000t of MAP 11-52-0 and 15,000t of DAP 18-46-0 for July shipment have been concluded at $500/t cfr for discharge at several ports, including Aratu, Recife and Rio Grande. These sales are understood to have been reported previously by Mosaic.\\nTwo handysized vessels of Chinese MAP 11-44-0 and MAP 10- 50-0 in combination with TSP are on offer. Around 10,000t of MAP 10-50-0 in small lots have traded at $455-465/t cfr Rio Grande. The MAP 11-44-0 portion is offered at $400/t cfr and above.\\nBrazilian MAP imports fell by a third in the first five months of this year according to latest GTIS statistics, as poor farmer economics, a weak Real and high inventories from Q4 continued to take their toll. However, May imports have rallied strongly as the season approaches.\\nImports of MAP in May hit 263,003t, up nearly 170,000t on the previous month, following a buying spree and price ap- preciation in April.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nOf the total, 102,936t were sourced from Russia, through direct sales and via traders. Chinese MAP accounted for 65,511t, with US material recording 56,373t.\\nYear-to-date imports have reached 709,228t, down 33.5pc. Russia formed the largest share, with 254,868t, down a third on the same period of 2014. The US was second with 168,688t, up 7.4pc. OCP Morocco\\'s decision to switch away from Brazil in Q1 is still reflected in the numbers with only 114,874t moved, down 61.7pc. China accounted for 109,403t, up 6.3pc.\\nDAP imports for the calendar year to date are down by slightly less at 239,706t, a fall of 25.6pc. The US has been the largest supplier with 149,931t, down 32.5pc year on year. Russia is some way behind in second with 35,525t. Saudi Ara- bia and Morocco accounted for around 27,000t each.\\nFor the month of May, Brazil imported 60,968t DAP, with almost half supplied from the US, 20,000t from Saudi Arabia via traders and 7,000t from OCP.\\nArgentina\\nA buyer has purchased 5,000t of US MAP at $505/t cfr for July shipment. This sale is understood to have been covered under Mosaic’s reported 38,000t DAP/MAP/MES sale to South America reported last week.\\nRussian MAP is on offer at $510/t cfr while OCP is also re- portedly offering DAP/MAP at $510/t cfr minimum. At least two buyers report being offered Chinese 11-52 at $500-505/t cfr while Chinese 10-50 is at $460-475/t cfr.\\nEurope and former Soviet Union\\nRussia\\nEuroChem has sold an additional 5,000t of Lifosa DAP at a stable $500/t fob for June delivery to eastern Europe. Its June Lifosa DAP sales now total 15,000-20,000t. It still has 50,000-60,000t available this month.\\nIts next available MAP cargo will be in July. The producer is still targeting $490/t fob.\\nTurkey\\nOCP has sold 30,000t of DAP to a Turkish buyer in the low- $510s/t cfr for loading end June/early July. It is not clear if this shipment has been made under the recently announced OCP supply agreement with Toros.\\nTurkish DAP imports in April totalled 16,484t versus 3,791t in the same month of 2014, according to latest GTIS data. Russia was the primary source, accounting for 14,002t while a smaller volume of 2,450t was sourced from Jordan.\\nDespite a rise in imports during April, total DAP deliveries during the first four months of 2015 dropped by 27pc year- on-year to 68,578t. Of this total, 39,952t originated in Jor- dan, 17,002t came from Russia and 11,465t was from Tunisia.\\nAfrica and Middle East\\nSaudi Arabia\\nMa’aden still has a DAP cargo available for loading mid/late- June and continues to be offering in Pakistan at a netback in the $480s/t fob.\\nNegotiations are also underway for DAP/MAP in Africa and South America for early July shipment.\\nSabic reports the sale of a July DAP cargo to Pakistan in the mid-$480s/t cfr, which would netback to the mid-$470s/t fob.\\nSabic will ship 2 x 40,000t DAP cargoes to India in June with the first loading from Ras Al-Khair on 19 June and the second parcel on 23 June.\\nIt will also load 25,000t MAP on 3 July for South Africa, as reported last week.\\nMorocco\\nOCP reports the sale of 30,000t DAP to Turkey at a price netting back to $504-505/t fob. The parcel will load end June/early July.\\nThe producer says it is sold out for June and will begin dis- cussing July shipments next week.\\nOCP has indicated it will ship at least one DAP/MAP cargo to the US in July. Another cargo could also be lined up depend- ing on when the Q3 phosphoric acid price is settled.\\nOCP\\'s new 1mn t DAP/MAP/NPK line is still in the com- missioning phase and production is being ramped up. The producer expects the line to be operating at full capacity in August/September.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nIndian subcontinent\\nIndia\\nZuari has purchased 60,000t of Chinese DAP at a price un- derstood to be close to $480/t cfr.\\nChambal has also purchased 40,000t of Chinese DAP at a price indicated around $480/t cfr.\\nRCF has issued a purchase tender, closing 22 June, for a total of 75,000t DAP, of which 40,000t should be delivered to Mundra and 35,000t to Gangavaram in the first half of August. Offers should be valid for 15 days.\\nOverall, Indian deliveries are adequate with the June line-up standing at just over 850,000t while July deliveries total 410,000t so far. Total DAP imports during April-July are estimated to be close to 3mn t. Due to this adequate supply, some buyers are countering offers with bids in the low/mid- $470s/t cfr for July shipment.\\nThe monsoon remains a concern for importers as does the value of the rupee which currently stands at Rs63.84:$1, but the latter issue appears to be a bigger worry and is prevent- ing any sharp upticks in price.\\nThe Department of Fertilizers (DoF) is understood to have held a meeting on 10 June to revisit the freight subsidy sys- tem for fertilizers. Earlier this year, it was announced that freight rates would be incorporated into the subsidy which would be beneficial for a number of states where transpor- tation costs are high due to the distance from the ports. But it has now emerged that the government is reconsidering this new freight subsidy programme.\\nProvisional FAI data shows that DAP sales in May totalled 838,000t while stocks at the end of the month amounted to 309,000t.\\nPakistan\\nSabic reports the sale of a DAP cargo in the mid-$480s/t cfr to United Agro for July shipment.\\nFauji has invited offers for 30,000-40,000t of DAP for July delivery.

Freight for the panamax has been indicated at $10-12/t providing a netback of $468-470/t fob.\\nMost market players seem to agree that the $460/t fob level has gone and sales at that level are now unachievable from producers. In contrast to this, the awards for the Bangladesh DAP tender appear to reflect $460-470/t fob but the level of producer backing remains unclear.\\nFor Pakistan and India, prices are pegged in the low/mid- $460s/t fob while higher numbers are being sought for Southeast Asia.\\nOn MAP, Wengfu reports the sale of 5,000t MAP 11-52 to Latin America at $480/t fob.\\nYUC reports to be now producing MAP 11-52 and is also targeting $480/t fob.

These include 150,000t at Zhanjiang port, 150,000t at Fangcheng port and 70,000t at Beihai port.\\nChina Domestic\\nThe domestic DAP market is steady. The DAP price in the southwest of the country remains at RMB3,000-3,050/t northeast delivery this week, equivalent to RMB2,650/t ex-works. Hubei producers are still holding at RMB2,700/t ex-works.\\nProducers are satisfied with their current position and are reluctant to reduce their DAP price to meet Indian bids. Indian buyers are saying the drought and the depreciation of the Indian rupee will deter Indian farmers from buying in the short-term. But producers are confident that India will be back in the market because they need to buy for rabi.\\nThe major producers are sold out to end June while some have no availability until July.\\nThe MAP price remained stable-to-firm this week. Demand from NPK producers is still strong. Most MAP producers are booked out to end June or early July.

Prices in India, however, are stable and the Chinese are reluctant to meet Indian counter bids in the low/mid-$470s/t cfr. While the key demand regions have slowed, interest has emerged in several other markets. Argentina has booked Australian MAP at $505-507/t cfr. Turkey has taken a Russian DAP cargo at above $510/t cfr. Pakistan has booked another Saudi DAP in the high-$480s/t cfr. ETG has purchased a second Saudi MAP cargo in the mid-$480s/t fob while southeast Asia has taken a total of 50,000t Chinese DAP at $472-475/t fob. ICL has also confirmed that one of its two TSP/SSP plant at its Rotem site is still operating following a fire on 11 June.\\nOutlook: stable\\nHeadlines:\\n\\x84\\x84Pakistan books another cargo; interest for two more \\x84\\x84Mosaic sells DAP to Latin America at $470-474/t fob \\x84\\x84Argentina buys Australian MAP at $505-507/t cfr\\nView the methodology used to assess phosphate prices at www.argusmedia.com/methodology.

Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively comfort- able suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.\\nAlthough the market is stable overall, there is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters. The pause in Brazil has been put down to two key reasons. The first reason being the availability of the credit\\npackage announced by the government two weeks ago. Some argue that Brazilian demand inland has come to a halt as farmers are not willing to purchase any fertilizers until the credit announced by the government is available. There are reports that this could take as long as 45 days for the credit to appear in the banks.\\nThe second reason is the poor correlation between fertilizer and soybean prices, which has been deterring farmers from purchasing fertilizers. Due to the lack of farmer demand, distributors are reluctant to build inventory until there is more movement inland.\\nSuppliers, on the whole, are largely undisturbed by this hia- tus and are confident that Brazil will return to the market, mostly because they believe it has to. This is supported by latest Anda figures which report a 19.1pc drop in phospho- rous-based fertilizer consumption during January-May 2015 while imports fell by nearly 27pc year-on-year. Offers have largely remained stable around $500/t cfr.\\nA similar view is taken on India. Demand currently is slow as buyers are well-covered for the kharif season and im- porters feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to have been lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable. But suppliers are not concerned about this slowdown as another estimated 2-2.5 mn t is required for the rabi season, equivalent to an average of around 800,000t/ month for August-October. Of this, roughly 200,000-250,000t could be met by the Saudis, Jordanians and possibly Rus- sians, leaving the Chinese with the lions\\' share. Moreover, the monsoon is progressing well which is also providing an overall positive picture.\\nWith lukewarm trading forecast in India over the next few weeks, the Chinese are focused mainly on shipping MAP to Latin America. Port congestion times in Brazil are around\\n40-45 days and if product is to arrive in time for September, vessels need to be loaded fairly promptly. Vessels for Argen- tina have a little more time with the loading window likely coming to a close mid/late-July. After this, focus will be mainly on India with additional demand from Pakistan while Southeast Asia is expected to continue buying small 6,000t DAP cargoes consistently through Q3. Pakistani demand continues to emerge with another Saudi cargo sold this week while rumours of a Chinese cargo sold is also circulating.\\nThe outlook remains stable-to-firm through Q3.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nHighlights this week\\nSupply\\n\\x84\\x8490,000-100,000t Saudi MAP sold for July shipment...\\n\\x84\\x84...which highlights lack of Indian DAP demand\\n\\x84\\x84ICL confirms one of two TSP/SSP plants down after fire \\x84\\x84Reports that GCT\\'s TSP plant is operating\\n\\x84\\x84Bagfas has 20,000-30,000t DAP available for July\\nDemand\\n\\x84\\x84Pakistan takes another Saudi DAP cargo \\x84\\x84Turkey buys another 20,000-25,000t DAP \\x84\\x84Brazilian and Indian markets still at a pause\\n\\x84\\x84Argentina books 60,000t MAP of various grades\\nPrices\\n\\x84\\x84Mosaic sells DAP to Latin America at $470-474/t fob\\nthe phosphates world this week\\n\\x84\\x84Saudi MAP sold to Latin America in the low-$500s/t cfr \\x84\\x84Australian MAP achieves $505-507/t cfr Argentina\\n\\x84\\x84Southeast Asia takes Chinese DAP at $472-475/t fob \\x84\\x84Pakistan buys Saudi DAP in the high-$480s/t cfr\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nMosaic has sold 17,000t of DAP to various Latin American markets at $470-474/t fob for July shipment.\\nHigher shipments to India and Latin American countries boosted US exports of DAP/MAP in May to their highest monthly total since May 2014.\\nThe US exported 236,180st P2O5 of DAP/MAP (estimated 450,000-510,000st product) in May, a 33.8pc month-on-\\nUS - Mosaic sells 17,000t DAP\\nto Latin America at $470-\\n474/t fob\\nBrazil - Inland demand \\noffers slip sub-$500/t cfr\\nSaudi Arabia - Sabic sells MAP to \\nfob.

These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.\\nThe US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.\\nThe US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.\\nCanada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same\\nmonth last year. The US exported 11,736st P2O5 to Mexico in May, down 18.5pc from April and 31.8pc from May 2014.\\nHigher May exports led January-May US P2O5 exports to reach 869,339st, a 3.4pc year-over-year increase.\\nDomestic\\nThe US market continues to trade in a tight range, though activity is seasonally limited. Domestic DAP for July loading traded within the prevailing $418-420/st fob Nola range this week. Despite the lack of buying interest, downside price pressure appears to be limited for DAP/MAP barges given Nola’s stark discount to other import markets. At current values, a rash of imports to Nola are unlikely over the com- ing months. Price upside could be limited by sustained lower crop prices, which could result in phosphate application cutbacks in the fall.\\nCentral and Latin America\\nBrazil\\nThe Brazilian market is marginally weaker this week against continued sluggish demand due to a lack of movement in- land. Farmers are awaiting credit from the government while others blame the poor correlation between fertilizer and crop prices.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nSome suppliers have reportedly dropped their offers slightly for MAP 11-52 to the $490s/t cfr. However, most offers are continuing to be made in the $500-505/t cfr range. Suppli- ers are unconcerned about this pause in the market and are confident Brazil will return to the market, for no other reason than they have to.\\nYUC reports selling Chinese 11-52 to Brazil at $500-505/t cfr but this is unconfirmed on the buy side.\\nA trader is offering the balance of an Australian MAP cargo at $500/t cfr Paranagua while Russian MAP is understood to be offered at $495-500/t cfr.\\nChinese 11-44 is on offer at $395-405/t cfr while 10-50 is of- fered at $450-455/t cfr, both for discharge at Paranagua.\\nBrazilian fertilizer sales dropped by 21.4pc to 2.07mn t in May from a year earlier, Brazil\\'s fertilizer industry associa- tion Anda said.\\nIn the first five months of 2015, fertilizer consumption fell by 12pc to 9.04mn t compared with the same period of 2014.\\nDomestic fertilizer production declined by 4.9pc in May to 708,216 t from a year earlier, but rose by 5.5pc in the first five months of the year to 3.62mn t compared to the same period of 2014.\\nFertilizer imports declined by 5.5pc in May to 1.79mn t and fell by 18.4pc to 7.26mn t in the first five months of the year.\\nThe trends reflect a weakening Brazilian currency versus the US dollar, as well as a decline in investments in crop inputs as farmers seek to trim costs amid rising interest rates and tighter margins.\\nPhosphorous-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a de- cline in demand in sugar cane and second-crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy plant- ing season which begins in September. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period.\\nBrazil\\'s largest grain-producing state Mato Grosso accounted for the highest share of fertilizer consumption in the first five months of 2015, at 1.73mn t, followed by Parana state with 1.36mn t and Sao Paulo state with 1.14mn t.\\nBrazil recently began harvesting its second-crop corn. The country\\'s crop supply company Conab estimates that the 2014/15 second-crop corn harvest will reach 49.4mn t, a 2pc increase from the 2013/14 crop. Overall grain output is seen reaching 204.5mn t this season, up by 5.6pc.\\nLocal agricultural consultancy Agroconsult is projecting that the recent hike in interest rates for the farm sector could decrease soy-planted areas in the upcoming 2015/16 crop season.\\nAs a result, Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009, according to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increasing.\\nArgentina\\nA trader has reportedly sold 30,000t Australian MAP to an Argentinean buyer at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment.\\nAnother trader has sold 30,000t of Chinese 10-50 at $473- 475/t cfr.

Of this total, 42,413t went to Estonia and 11,601t was shipped to Italy.\\nMAP shipments during January-April 2015, however, were up 9pc year-on-year to 596,024t. The bulk of the exports were shipped to the US (231,430t), followed by Estonia (138,344t), Belarus (41,693t) and Brazil (40,965t).\\nRussian DAP shipments in April fell by 37pc year-on-year to 49,074t, of which 24,749t went to Estonia and 19,277t went to India.\\nDAP exports during the first four months of 2015 rose by 133pc to 555,853t compared with 239,071t in the correspond- ing period one year earlier. Estonia was the top destination during this period taking 107,912t, followed by France with 99,320t and the US with 90,662t.\\nLithuania\\nDAP exports in April were down by 62pc year-on-year from 71,699t to 27,206t, according to latest GTIS statistics. Just under a third of the shipments went to Germany (10,004t) while 6,166t was shipped to Ireland and 4,000t went to Spain.\\nDAP shipments during the first four months of the year decreased by 8pc year-on-year to 250,613t, of which 74,143t went to the Netherlands, 62,033t to Germany and 46,006t to Ireland.\\nTurkey\\nEuroChem reports the sale of 20,000-25,000t of Lithuanian DAP to a Turkish buyer at a price indicated above $510/t cfr duty free for June loading.\\nOn the export front, Bagfas is quoting $505/t fob for July DAP sales and will have 20,000-30,000t available.\\nA trader is understood to have purchased around 35,000t of DAP from Bagfas for southeast Europe for shipping in several lots. However, this deal was concluded a few weeks ago.\\nItaly\\nDAP is next used in autumn but current market prices are not tempting buyers to book and store. Latest bulk offers to blenders are €495/t fca, reflecting around €515/t fca bagged. Several traders/sellers are holding stocks in Ravenna.\\n1Q 2015 DAP imports totalled around 77,000t, down 26pc\\nyear-on-year, according to GTIS data. This reflects the disap- pointing DAP consumption this season, a result of compara- tively high DAP prices versus crop returns.\\nfrance\\nThe market for DAP has remained seasonally quiet with new demand expected in the second-half of July. Distributors are buying small spot quantities at €475-480/t fca Rouen. This is €10-15/t lower than initial offers. DAP sellers are offering DAP in dollars at $530-535/t fca.\\nEuroChem is understood to have a new DAP cargo arriving into Rouen in July. The cargo is reported to have been sold at around $500/t fob Klaipeda, which would translate to around €475-480/t fca Rouen.\\nSpain\\nThe Tarragona port authorities said that levels of phosphates traffic through the Spanish port of Tarragona fell in the first four months of the year to 31,703t, a 33pc fall on 47,201t through the port in the same period in 2014.\\nBelgium\\nThere is still no interest in purchasing DAP for fall cereal ap- plications.

However, duty on Russian DAP was raised from 3pc to 6.5pc on ship- ments to the EU (Lithuanian product is duty free) which has lowered the resultant netback on Russian DAP and widened the range considerably. Argus FMB proposes to introduce a Lithuanian DAP fob price and a Russian DAP fob price.\\n\\x84\\x84DAP US Gulf domestic barge $/st – it is proposed the name of this assessment is changed to DAP Nola barge fob $/st. This is to clarify that the assessment has always included DAP of all origins, not just domestically produced material, as implied by the name.\\n\\x84\\x84DAP Central Florida railcar $/st – due to a lack of liquid- ity it is proposed that this assessment is dropped from the weekly phosphates report and the North American Fertilizer report.\\n\\x84\\x84DAP India (contract) cfr – as prices are mostly agreed on a spot basis it is proposed to rename the assessment to DAP India cfr.\\nNew price quotes:\\n\\x84\\x84China MAP 11-44, 10-50 and 11-52 fob - due to liquidity and volumes traded (especially to Brazil) following the in- troduction of a flat rate export tax at the beginning of 2015 it is proposed to introduce these new assessments.\\n\\x84\\x84DAP southeast Asia cfr – predominantly relating to Viet- nam and Thailand DAP markets which collectively account for around 1mn t/year DAP imports, or approximately 7pc of global DAP trade.\\nArgus will accept comments on these changes up to Friday 26 February.

Latin American prices have contin- ued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. In Argentina, MAP has traded at $335/t cfr with $325/t cfr widely reported done in Brazil. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre. Meanwhile in Europe, GCT has seen DAP prices fall to below $380/t fob on latest business in Turkey.\\nWith DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phos- phate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shut- downs in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realized, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quarterly finished phosphate production capacity.\\nThe cuts amount to a loss of around 200,000t DAP/MAP in February and March assuming the cuts began at the begin- ning of February. The likely response will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encourag-\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\ning more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit.\\nThe question is who will follow Mosaic\\'s lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the market.\\nClearly the hope among \\'traditional\\' suppliers is that high- cost producers, speciﬁcally the Chinese, will have to exit the market in the face of lower prices (PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev has apparently said as much this week). But in reality it is not so simple. In China, the consensus is that, despite falling fob levels and a decidedly uncertain domestic market outlook (inventories are reported to be high), producers will not cut back as heavily as some hope - Chinese producers need cash ﬂow and the preservation of market share. Dis- cussions have apparently generated more heat than light and the reality of a concerted producer-wide uniform production cut is complex to achieve and quite possibly unlikely.\\nThe problem is that Indian subcontinent and southeast Asian demand (which would absorb Chinese product) is paltry. There is little doubt Indian DAP import demand for the rest of Q1 will be negligible. Argus FMB understands the DoF has effectively banned the movement of DAP/NPKs from the ports inland. This will hinder further importation dur- ing February and March. India is a) full of product and b) mindful that further trades exposing ever lower cfr prices to the market will garner the attention of the authorities keen to cut the subsidy next fertilizer year. Asian demand is dead aside from a 3,000t DAP inquiry reported in Korea and some miniscule buying in Malaysia. Buyers are bidding in the $360s/t cfr in Vietnam and even Thailand. Traders are short- ing the market, but the price is a constantly moving target.\\nAndrey Guryev, the CEO of PhosAgro, appears to have dis- tanced the company from production cuts, opting for greater focus on complex fertilizer production and domestic market shipments.\\nAnd what of OCP? To some it was ironic that Mosaic an- nounced its cut back the same week that OCP inaugurated its new 1mn t/year DAP/MAP/NPK plant (dedicated for the African market) at Jorf Lasfar. In reality, this plant had already been running for some while so the demand/supply balance has not changed overnight. More important is at what level OCP is running its other plants. Based on current commitments at a shade over 200,000t DAP/MAP/NPKs for February and a monthly capacity of close to 600,000t, OCP\\nis clearly tailoring output to demand and will not chase busi- ness at lower levels in Brazil or even Europe.\\nFundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American demand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.\\nHIGHLIGHTS THIS WEEK\\nSupply\\n\\uf06eMosaic cuts Q1 production by 400,000t\\n\\uf06eLittle sign China will cut more production\\n\\uf06eOCP tailors output to demand\\n\\uf06eIndian DoF stops ports stocks moving inland\\n\\uf06eSabic \"postpones\" February production to March\\n\\uf06ePhosAgro more interested in complexes/NPS but will not cut output\\nDemand\\n\\uf06esoutheast Asian demand a trickle\\n\\uf06eBrazil buys some Saudi MAP\\n\\uf06eIndian demand stiﬂed by DoF\\nPrices\\n\\uf06eBrazil falls into the $320s/t cfr for MAP\\n\\uf06eArgentina pays $335/t cfr for MAP\\n\\uf06eIndian DAP discussions in $370s/t cfr\\n\\uf06eGCT DAP fob level falls below $380/t fob on Turkey sale\\nArgus Media Blog\\nhttp://blog.argusmedia.com\\nSubscribe to our blog for expert updates and analysis on the latest developments in the global oil industry\\nFollow us on Twitter @ArgusFMB\\nfor market insights from our editors.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nFMB Spot Sales Selection - 4 February 2016\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nMosaic has not made any DAP/MAP export sales this week and reiterates that it does not countenance making lower offers into Latin America given current cfr values there.\\nMosaic will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assum- ing these cuts are fully realized, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quarterly finished phosphate production capac- ity. Mosaic produced 2.4mn t of finished phosphates in the third quarter of 2015, representing 83pc of its operational capacity. The company releases fourth quarter and full-year figures on 11 February.\\n\"The long-term positive outlook for phosphates has not changed, but we are adjusting our production levels to match immediate demand and manage our margins,\" Mosaic chief executive Joc O\\'Rourke said.\\nthe phosphates world this week\\nThe company said the curtailment is in response to cur- rent crop nutrient market conditions. US DAP export prices have dropped steadily since September 2015, going from the mid-$450s/t fob Tampa to $380-$385/t fob as of last week because of decreasing global demand, particular in Brazil and Latin America.\\nMosaic\\'s phosphate feedstock costs have dropped sharply as well. The February Tampa ammonia contract fell by $40/t from January to a six-year low of $310/t cfr. The first quarter molten sulphur contract settled down $15/lt to $95/lt deliv- ered to its lowest point since the fourth quarter of 2013.\\nThe prospect of lowered US farm incomes and an unfavour- able outlook for crop prices have many farmers deferring fertilizer orders until the last minute. However, Mosaic believes prices are at a level that will inspire a rebound in demand.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nJanuary-March 2016 phosphate tenders\\n\"With the recent price volatility and decline in raw mate- rial costs, buyers appear to be delaying purchases. This is lengthening the seasonal period of weak demand,\" Mosaic senior vice president of commercial operations Rick McLel- lan said. \"Today\\'s crop nutrient prices, including phosphates, are attractive to farmers globally and we expect a strong demand response after this seasonally slow period.\"\\nUS domestic\\nThe domestic phosphates market held mostly steady this week with buyers and sellers relatively inactive for most of the week with limited physical trading taking place. Howev- er, Mosaic’s announcement on 3 February regarding produc- tion cuts caused a knee-jerk reaction in the market and motivated traders to move product as several barge trades were confirmed.\\nThe DAP barge price rose by $5/st at the top end to $315- 335/st fob Nola on moderate trade. The bottom end was underpinned by a confirmed trade late last Thursday for a February-loading open origin DAP barge. The high end was underpinned by confirmed a trade by Mosaic. Two barges of domestic DAP trade were confirmed at the $320-325/st fob Nola range. Indeed the majority of trade this week was confirmed at the $315-325/st fob Nola range.\\nCentral and Latin America\\nMexico\\nMexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.\\n\"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes,\" Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. \"This\\nacquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to become a low cost producer and a stronger competitor.\"\\nThe acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.\\nFertinal, Mexico\\'s lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices.

This will naturally affect demand ahead of the spring planting season, helping buyers be confident that they can enter a stable fertilizer market without concern that prices may fall further.\\n“In terms of demand for the spring planting season, our portfolio of orders consists primarily of complex fertilizers that are ready for direct application by end customers and are not blended like DAP or MAP. We intend to stick to our plan of increasing production capacities for complex fertil- izers, which are sold to high-margin markets and will not put pressure on prices for concentrated phosphate fertilizers.\\n“We are particularly focussed on increasing our sales of complex fertilizers and NPS in our priority domestic and regional markets.”\\nIt thus seems clear that PhosAgro will not be curtailing\\nAnnouncement\\nArgus completes and extends annual Iosco assurance review\\nArgus has completed its fourth external assurance review of its price benchmarks, extending the scope of the process to cover petrochemicals and fertilizers for the first time, as well as again covering crude, products, biofuels, thermal coal, coking coal, natural gas and biomass benchmarks.

MAP production rose 150pc to 104,000t as rock supply was restored to Voskressensk.\\nRussian DAP exports rose by 107pc during January-November 2015 to 1.1mn t. The main cause of the rise was the re- establishment of DAP exports to India with close to 350,000t shipped. A further 127,000t were shipped to Estonia (for onward shipment for export) and there was an 88pc rise in exports to the US to 127,000t. France and Belgium col- lectively took almost 200,000t during the period (a rise of 196pc and 283pc respectively).\\nNovember exports of DAP totalled 29,000t, mostly destined for the US and Belarus.\\nRussia exported 1.784mn t MAP in the first 11 months of 2015 according to GTIS data. This was a rise of 2pc. The main recipients were Brazil with 468,000t, down a third, and Estonia (for onward exportation) with 380,000t (up 4pc). The US was the fastest-growing major market, taking 299,000t, a rise of 286pc.

Some market players believe that prices sub- $420/t fca may be achievable in this current environment. Material is not required for application until April, although bulk blenders will need product slightly earlier so there is still time to buy. Moreover, weak international DAP prices are keeping buyers on the sidelines, uncertain of the right moment to step in.\\nSpain\\nThere are a wide range of price indications across Spain. In the south indications range €420-440/t fca/ex-warehouse, with certain importers trying to keep levels towards the high end based on the expensive stock being held.\\nBut in the north, DAP is available at €435-440/t delivered basis supplies in Bayonne, France.

This is thought to be via a regional trader. Last DAP trades in the region for 18-46 DAP were in the high-$380s/t cfr Thailand. Overall liquidity in the southeast Asian markets is very thin.\\nKorea\\nChobi Co is reported to be in the market for 3,000t DAP.\\nPhilippines\\nThere are unconfirmed reports of interest in a 6,000t DAP lot supposedly under discussion in the low-$360s/t cfr for 17.5-46 DAP.\\nThailand\\nTraders are offering short into Thailand below $380/t cfr but bids are now at $375/t cfr with reports late this week of bids falling lower.

China saw its shipments rise by a quarter to 197,000t for the year while US exports fell 16pc to 130,000t. Saudi DAP supplies rose marginally by 2pc to 31,000t.\\nThe trend partly reflects China\\'s rise as the pre-eminent global DAP supplier, particularly in the southeast Asian, re- gion following its adoption of a flat export tax allowing ship- ments all year round. US production and exports continue to erode marginally on environmental concerns over phosphate rock mining, as well as greater emphasis on regional and domestic markets for US producers and a switch to manufac- ture of other phosphate products.\\nJapanese December DAP imports stood at 27,960t, compris- ing around 10,000t from China, 10,000t from Saudi Arabia and 8,000t from the US.\\nNew Zealand\\nImports of both DAP and MAP fertilizer to New Zealand fell in 2015 according to latest GTIS data.\\nFull year 2015 DAP imports were down by a fifth to 237,642t. There was a noticeable change in the make up of the im- port origins with Chinese DAP shipments rising by 21pc to 183,000t as it consolidated its position as the main supplier in the southeast Asian region. US shipments rose significantly to 46,000t from zero in 2014. The drop was on account of less Australian cargoes coming in, where tonnage dropped by over 50,000t to just 7,000t.\\nDecember DAP imports reached 44,976t, all sourced from China.\\nMAP imports for the year fell by 41pc to 220,000t, with 140,000t sourced from China, itself a fall of 47pc.

Amfert TSP remains on offer at €365/t ex-works Amsterdam.\\nNPK\\nChina\\nThe domestic NPK market did not change this week with demand still weak and operating rates low. Many small NPK producers are said to have stopped production as their work- force has left for the holiday season. With the NPK market essentially in hibernation since the end of the autumn sea- son in 2015, it is estimated that the NPK stock is lower than normal. Hence when the application season comes, there might be a problem in NPK supply in some areas. However, it is doubtful that the NPK supply will be short because the low urea price might attract farmers to use more urea and less NPK in the spring application season.\\nThe mainstream offer price of 15-15-15 CL stabilized at around RMB2,000/t ex-works and that of 15-15-15 S at around RMB2,250/t ex-works.\\nBelgium\\nThere is zero interest in complex fertilizers at present. How- ever, buyers are well aware of the latest falls in urea, DAP and potash and this is bound to pressure NPK prices lower once re-stocking begins. Last prices of imported 15-15-15 were at €325/t fca ex-store with local product offered at €335/t cif inland.\\nGermany\\nThere is little interest in NPKs at the moment. The price of 15-15-15 continues to be indicated at €335-340/t cif inland. Polish 15-15-15 is offered within this range.

Canpotex has already reported this level for June but oth- ers were mostly around $325-335/t. Low crop prices and a weaker Real currency have made farmers and consequently importers more cautious than last year where purchases are concerned.\\nIt is worth noting that granular prices around the world have now largely converged. Whereas last year the US market was paying more than anywhere else in the world at over $400 per metric tonne cfr US Gulf and NW Europe was one of the lowest due to the weakening euro, now the former has come down and the latter come up. Typical cfr prices in US dollars or its equivalent are now as follows:\\n$340-351/t cfr US Gulf\\n$338-348/t cfr NW Europe\\n$330-345/t cfr Brazil (and heading to $340-350) $345-355/t cfr SE Asia\\nWhile India has been booking significant contracts to be imported over the rest of 2015 and through into Q1 2016, concern is growing whether the delayed monsoon rains will cut application during the April-September Kharif season. The El Nino weather pattern is partly responsible for this and it could also have an impact in other Asian markets.\\nThat aside, the supplies of standard MOP are still relatively comfortable overall, while granular MOP demand has yet to match that seen last year.\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nFormerly FMB Weekly Potash Report\\nIssue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015\\nPrices\\n*- Indicative price\\n**- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in India\\n***- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in China\\n****- this price for France/Benelux.

The irony here is that if successive governments had done something to redress the balance of the N:P:K ratio applied, then the additional K (potash) would have made the coming crop more resistant to drought. As it is the amount of MOP applied is well below the recommend- ed levels, even though demand partly recovered last year.\\nA delegation from ICL/DSW should be travelling to India soon to finalise contracts with IPL, Zuari and CIL. Observers will be interested to see if the quantities will be similar to last year or cut back due to the strike.\\nIssue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015\\nAs reported last week, ICL/DSW has loaded a vessel with a second nominated in the interim. The contract price will be a formality at the $332/t cfr, including 180 days credit, level that has already been set with other suppliers.\\nBPC is understood to have reached agreements with Zuari and Chambal but the tonnages have yet to be confirmed. As noted last week, BPC is also shipping the 175,000t firm and 90,000t option awarded in RCF’s tender.\\nIt is still estimated that when all the contracts and tenders are done, India will have booked around 4.5-4.75mn tonnes firm, while options could take it up to 5.0-5.2mn in all.\\nThere is no news of an award yet in the tender by National Fertilizer Limited (NFL). As previously reported, it received three offers in its tender for 2 x 25,000t MOP cargoes - from IPL, MMTC and BPC. It is believed that all three quoted 50,000t each at $332/t cfr with 180 days.\\nIndia: MOP vessels arrived and scheduled so far for June\\nA total of eight vessels carrying 256,000t MOP to India are known to have been scheduled for June arrival, an increase of three vessels from last week. The new vessels are carry- ing Uralkali material for Zuari and PPL, and BPC material for IPL and RCF.\\nChina\\nThe domestic MOP market is still weak as this is now the off-season. Qinghai Salt Lake Co maintains its prices at Rmb 2,000/t (c.$328/t at current exchange rates) delivered for 60% MOP crystal. Russian standard pink MOP is still at Rmb 2,130/t ($349) ex-warehouse at major ports. The domestic potash industry is preparing to attend a potash conference\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nnext month in Qinghai.\\nGranular MOP prices have come under pressure in the sec- ond quarter, due to the increase in the number of importers that can distribute it. Prices are understood to be only some $5/t above that for standard MOP.\\nAs of 11 June, the MOP inventory at Chinese ports remained stable at 1.10m tons.\\nThe domestic SOP market is still sluggish. Luobupo holds its price at Rmb 2,800/t ($459) delivered for standard SOP and Rmb 3,000/t ($492) for granular SOP. The Mannheim produc- ers still hold at Rmb 2,900-3,000/t ($475-492) ex-works.\\nMalaysia\\nConfusion has reigned in the Malaysian market this week as the Ringgit weakened further against the US dollar, touching\\n3.76on Monday 8 June but recovering slightly to 3.73 at the time of writing.\\nAccording to the latest reports some bidders are retract- ing their offers in the tenders for second half delivery, as a result. As rumoured in our report of 21 May, competitive offers were initially around Ringgits 1,225-1,230/t fot in bags ex-warehouse near the port. Assuming Ringgits 60/t for costs and an exchange rate of 3.6 to the US Dollar, this would equate to around $325/t cfr port in bulk. Others put the costs at Ringgits 80/t which would take another $5-6 off the price.\\nHowever, during the subsequent negotiations (“interviews”) the most competitive offers in three tenders for a combined total of 30,000t standard MOP, are said to have come down to Ringgits 1,170-1,180/t. These tenders are by IOI, KLK and BSSB (Borneo Samudera Sdn Bhd Pte Ltd). At 3.76 this would be only equivalent to $295-298/t cfr bulk on the basis of Ringgit 60/t costs, which would mean that importers would lose heavily. Importers are not surprisingly now pushing for Ringgits 1,250/t which would be closer to $320/t (again using the lower cost figure).\\nFor comparison, a year ago this week, the Ringgit stood at\\n3.22to the dollar and 1,170/t would have equated to $347 and 1,250/t to $372 on the same basis!\\nMalaysian MOP imports up 40pc in 1Q\\nMalaysia\\'s MOP imports in the first quarter 2015 totalled 421,000t - a 40pc increase from the year before.\\nIssue 15-23 | Thursday 11 June 2015\\nThe increase is reflected in a tripling of imports from BPC - up to 87,000t in 2015 from 27,000t the year before. Deliver- ies from Uralkali doubled, to 93,000t.\\nCanpotex remains the largest supplier, though deliveries fell by 20,000t (-13pc) from 2014.\\nDeliveries by APC and K+S were stable with the year before. ICL Spain made delivery of 15,000t in January and 12,000t in February.\\nMalaysia: MOP imports January-March\\nSource: Department of Statisticts Malaysia, copyright GTIS\\nVietnam\\nPrices are understood to be around $330 and $350/t cfr in this market.\\nCanpotex is shipping a cargo of close to 50,000t MOP to Phu My port on the Karavados\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nThailand\\nFurther to our report last week that BPC is planning two shipments to this market in June/July and claiming the price is roughly $355/t cfr for granular MOP, it is understood that around 70,000t MOP will be shipped over the two months.\\nIsrael\\nICL/DSW is busy loading 50,000t vessels for China as report- ed last week. As ICL has a stockpile of standard MOP that can stand in the open air (almost no rain falls throughout the year at the Dead Sea), it could start shipments immedi- ately. Granular MOP degrades if left standing, however, so little or no stocks are held. As a result, production from the granulation equipment has to build up enough for a cargo to be loaded and the first shipment will not be made until the second half or even towards the end of June.\\nAs noted under India above, a delegation from ICL/DSW should be travelling to India soon to finalise contracts with IPL, Zuari and CIL. Observers will be interested to see if the quantities will be similar to last year or cut back due to the strike. Already two shipments of standard MOP have been lined up in the meantime as reported last week.\\nAfrica\\nSouth Africa\\nICL is planning a shipment of around 20,000t fine/standard MOP to this market in July. Discussions with customers are expected to start soon.\\nMeanwhile most suppliers are offering around $360-370/t cfr for granular MOP to be shipped to this market.\\nArgus FMB Europe\\nFertilizer 2015\\n28-30 October | Barcelona\\nwww.argusmedia.com/fertilizer-europe Events\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nSnapshot - World potash prices/netbacks\\nEuropeNorth America\\nNegotiations have yet to begin with respect to the Q3 con- tract price for NPK manufacturers. However, Uralkali will start talks with some of its customers at the Argus FMB East Europe conference in Prague next week. No decision has been made so far as to what will be proposed. If an increase is tabled, some believe it will be for at least €10/t.\\nThe US market drifted lower this week as buyers seek a floor for summer fill values.

So far little inter- est is being shown as many importers have warehouses full. Farmers have yet to shift sufficient quantities. One source said that some tonnages where purchase has already been contracted by the farmer, have yet to move out of the ware- house even.\\nThere is also a report that $350/t cfr is being indicated by\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nsome suppliers for August shipment.\\nA cargo of 11,500t of German granular MOP on the Santa Barbara is due to berth 16 June at Itaqui for Yara.

This has been widely reported in the Chilean press.\\nIt should be noted that Corfo has been unwilling to go on- record on this topic.\\nSQM and Corfo have been in arbitration since 16 May 2014. It has been widely known since the arbitration started that Corfo wishes to end SQM\\'s lease agreement for its property in the Salar de Atacama early, and claims that SQM under- paid the royalties due to Corfo for its mining in the Salar de Atacama. The lease, which was signed in 1993, runs through to 2030. In one sense then, there is little new here. How- ever, Corfo is now expected to reject an arbitration judge’s recommendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seeking instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease.\\nSQM stated today that Corfo has not informed it of any deci- sion to abandon the arbitration process.\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nFormerly FMB Weekly Potash Report\\nIssue 15-24 | Thursday 18 June 2015\\nPrices\\n*- Indicative price\\n**- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in India\\n***- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in China\\n****- this price for France/Benelux.

According to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of SQM\\'s consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Ata- cama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.\\nAt present there is not enough clarity on the matter. Corfo\\'s plans for SQM have been public knowledge for a long time, and the arbitration process is ongoing. There is significant risk for SQM, however these latest reports do not contain much that increases it.\\nElsewhere in the world, MOP markets are signalling in op- posite directions. In Europe and Brazil, suppliers are pushing for price increases - about €10/t and $10/t respectively for July shipments.

Additionally, plantings for the major field crops, including maize, wheat and soybean, are in line with histori- cal five-year averages.

At present, domestic stocks total up to 1mn t and a further 400,000t were forecast to arrive during February and March. But these will likely be deferred, effectively halting further first quarter imports. The unsold stock and deferred shipments will be subject to the new subsidy as of the second quarter, which is expected to be lower. The measure is widely reported but yet to be confirmed by the Indian government.\\nOfficially there has been no progress with 2016 Chinese con- tract talks and now this market is heading into the New Year and Spring Festival holidays. NPK plants are already shut down and no activity is expected over the coming weeks. With China and India, the two largest standard MOP markets, effectively out for the time being there is increased pressure on suppliers to cut production. As reported, several have already taken action.\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nFormerly FMB Weekly Potash Report\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nPrices\\n**- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in India\\n***- Estimated netback from cfr contracts in China\\nElsewhere MOP spot prices have mostly traded lower or sideways. In northwest Europe, MOP seasonal demand should be evident, but as yet, buyers are content to wait and see. In the US demand is minimal, pushing price indications lower in Nola. Buyers do not foresee any supply issues in the short- term so remain absent from the market.\\nIn Brazil, firm demand is limited and price indications have edged down again. A trade has been reported this week at a price understood to be around $240/t cfr Brazil, but below this level is also achievable. Some price stability has emerged this week in Malaysia and Indonesia, however, aided by strengthening local currencies compared to the US dollar.\\nWith India and China both out for now, Indonesian and Ma- laysian tender buying drawing to a close, demand in the US and Brazil showing no signs of improving, the global market looks set for a quiet period over the short-term. Chinese contract talks should start in March, but when they will conclude is anyone’s guess.\\nGranular MOP CFR Bulk\\nView the methodology used to assess potash prices at www.argusmedia. com/methodology.

The current subsidy rate for MOP is 9,300 rupees/t ($137/t), but the new rate is expected to be lower.\\nThe volume of MOP potentially impacted by the restriction on product movement is difficult to estimate, as it is unclear how much has already been sold. MOP stocks at India\\'s ports are estimated at around 150,000t. Total MOP stocks — in- cluding those in ports, warehouses and already held in the field — are estimated at up to 1mn t.\\nThe restriction on product movement also impacts imported DAP and NPKs.\\nChina\\nDomestic activity is winding down ahead of the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival next week. Downstream NPK plants have already closed and potash demand remains weak overall. High stocks are also evident following the 9.4mn t of MOP imports that arrived in 2015. Formal discussions for the 2016 annual contract are expected to commence in March.\\nBPC has been checking freight for 65,000t of MOP, load- ing mid-February for shipment to two-ports China, but the supplier reports to be moving product to warehouse for re- distribution within Asia. This follows a similar freight enquiry circulated by Uralkali last week, which also said no new Chinese business was behind it.\\nDomestic market\\nQHSL continues to offer its 60pc crystal MOP at Yn 2,080/t delivered (including 13pc VAT). The price of Russian pink MOP has declined Yn 40/t to around Yn 1,960/t ex-warehouse at major ports but no new sales are heard.\\nOn SOP, Luobupo is offering its 51pc powder at Yn 2,300/t delivered, while Mannheim producers are still nearer Yn 2,500/t exw for 50pc powder.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Potash\\nNepal\\nNepal’s Agriculture Inputs Company Limited (AICL) will close a tender on 15 February for 5,000t of MOP.\\nMalaysia\\nThe most recent plantation tender awards have taken place at around 1,150 ringgit/t fot bagged. While the fot level has eased slightly, the recent firming of the ringgit against the US dollar has maintained equivalent cfr levels in the mid/ high-$250s/t before costs. Certain suppliers talk of higher equivalent levels nearer $260-270/t cfr. The ringgit was trad- ing at 4.12:$1 close to press time, compared with 4.35:$1 a month ago.\\nAmong recent awards, IOI is understood to have purchased a total of 38,000t of standard MOP at around 1,150 ringgit/t fot bagged under its recent requirement for various fertilizer products. Confirmation on the buy side was not available.\\nThe tender season for delivery during the first half of 2016 is winding down with most of the major buying now complete. One exception is Felda which continues to negotiate its 150,000t requirement, according to latest reports.\\nMany offices will be closed next week for the Chinese New Year. The next round of buying will start during the second half of May for delivery during the second half of 2016.\\nLocal distributors believe total MOP purchasing for the first half of 2016 has been down between 10-25pc on a normal year. The main reasons are plantations trying to reduce costs in light of current crude palm oil (CPO) levels. The declining price trend of MOP has also contributed to a lesser extent.\\nClose to press time, CPO was trading at around 2,530 ringgit/t on the Bursa Malaysia. This compared to around 2,480 ringgit/t at a similar time last week.\\nIndonesia\\nAs in Malaysia, substantial buying for the current tender sea- son is now complete. Local price indications remain around Rp 4,700/kg fot bagged including VAT. This now reflects around the low/mid-$280s/t cfr before costs, following the recent strengthening of the Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar.\\nSeveral buyers bought first quarter 2016 quantities rather than first half, as a way to limit exposure to falling prices. These buyers are expected to return to the market in March.\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nIndia: MOP vessels arrived and scheduled, from April 2015\\nSoutheast Asia: sMOP vs crude palm oil futures\\nMOP SE Asia ($/t) left-hand scale\\nMalaysia CPO (MYR/t) right-hand scale\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nJapan\\nFourth quarter 2015 MOP imports were down 18pc year-on- year at 116,787t, according to GTIS data. SOP imports during the fourth quarter also fell to 15,937t from 25,346t during the same period of 2014.\\nThe recent decline in MOP and SOP imports is mostly attrib- uted to weaker domestic demand from the downstream NPK sector. Farmers are keen to reduce costs and are expected to limit NPK usage this coming rice season. Also NPK prices are expected to fall in the next pricing period that runs from June-October, following the movement of raw materials, so there is an incentive to limit stocks.\\nFor the full year, MOP imports totalled 494,113t in 2015, down 8pc year-on-year. Canada was the leading supplier at 346,959t, but this was also down 11pc. SOP imports totalled 92,667t in 2015, up 4pc year-on-year. This was led by Ger- man supplies at 38,049t which rose 30pc year-on-year.\\napplication delayed and this could impact buying. Certain suppliers continue to target prices in the €270s/t cfr equiva- lent, but indications equivalent to just below €270/t cfr/cif are also available in the market.\\nFrance\\nMOP demand is minimal and indications are up to around\\n€10/t lower than in Benelux markets. There is a lot of uncer- tainty at the dealer level, partly because of the falling price of urea, and this is encouraging a wait and see attitude.\\nSpain\\nBuyers expect a price reduction of around €10/t imminently but, as yet, suppliers are holding firm. Granular MOP remains priced at €300-310/t delivered, reflecting €275-285/t cif port, with standard MOP around €10-20/t cheaper. Russian and Israeli standard MOP are among expected upcoming imports.\\nEurope\\nIn the main, potash purchasing is hand to mouth with many opting to wait until nearer application. Wet weather condi- tions across much of northern Europe have also deterred buying. Granular MOP prices have traded steady or slightly lower but easing freight rates and a firming euro have sup- ported fob netbacks.\\nTurkey\\nStandard MOP is offered in the mid-$260s/t cfr including 90 days’ credit, with buyers targeting below $260/t cfr.\\nDuring February, BPC will ship 4,000t of standard MOP to Al- pates and 3,000t of standard MOP to Ege Gubre ex-Nikolaev. These were booked in December with shipment delayed from January.\\nGermany\\nIt is understood that K+S raised its KornKali price by €4/t for February to €244/t cif inland. A €4/t increase is scheduled for March and another €4/t increase for April.\\nGranular MOP is indicated by certain sellers at €280-285/t fca Antwerp/Ghent to German customers.\\nUK\\nGranular MOP remains priced at £220-225/t fca bagged, reflecting the €260s/t cif port before costs.\\nBenelux\\nSuppliers are still waiting to see if farmers step in for MOP this month as is traditional.

Some 3.9mn t was reported in the first five months of collection between July and December, down from 4.09mn t in the same period in the 2014-15 harvest. Some smaller volumes are harvested over the rest of the year, as well as quantities that are reported late by smaller farmers and rural co-operatives.\\nStrong harvests outside France means French imports of rapeseed are at a record high, further eating into price support. Between July and November — the latest available ministerial data — France imported 762,000t of rapeseed, up from 393,000t in the same period in 2014 and the highest level for the period on records that go back to 1995.\\nCompany news\\nOCP’s Africa Fertilizer Complex inaugurated\\nAfrica Fertilizer Complex, part of OCP\\'s Jorf Lasfar phos- phate-production facility in Morocco was inaugurated on 1 February.\\nThe plant will solely supply fertilizers to African markets.

Prices in China have risen marginally to around $160/t cfr for granular sulphur and most sources believe the low-$160s/t cfr is achievable. In China, demand is being driven by export commitments for DAP into India and a firm NPK market leading to healthy in- terest in MAP production. Sulphur stocks are low and traders and buyers are active.\\nIndia also continues to pick off tonnage, despite reports of high levels of domestic sulphur inventory. Latest deals reflect the mid-$160s/t cfr. A lot has been made of the mon- soon deficit predicted at 80-88pc of normal. But its impact on fertilizer demand is still highly debatable. Bottom line, India still needs to buy sulphur and DAP for the rabi season.\\nAll of which makes Aramco\\'s July lifting price at $144/t fob (reflecting close to $160/t cfr China) seem a slightly modest increase which has surprised some observers. The increase is $2/t over the June number.\\nNevertheless, the outlook for the next 30-60 days remains for modest price gains on the back of a stable-to-firm phosphates market. DAP demand in the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, Bangladesh and India) is estimated at 4mn t im- ports for 2H 2015.

Sulphur prices have moved up as a result with numerous sources reporting that $160/t cfr has already been achieved for granular sulphur and that fresh business will probably take place in the low-$160s/t cfr. In terms of actual business:\\n\\x84\\x84One trader is reported to have sold a cargo of granular\\nsulphur into the north of the country at $160/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84Another deal for the south was reported in the high- $150s/t cfr, thought to be of Indian origin.\\n\\x84\\x84Another trader confirms selling 50,000t at $159.80/t cfr.\\nThere are unconfirmed reports of a small sale of sulphur at $165/t cfr.\\nAnother driver is the relative lack of domestic supply. Reports indicate that Puguang will lower gas production in the second half of the year, though unconfirmed, possibly limiting sulphur supply to around 100,000t/month during this period.\\nAll of which has combined to make traders more confident about taking positions, with end-users also buying. With port inventories not that high and imports limited traders are hoping to achieve higher prices.\\nMolten sulphur prices are also reportedly firming on the back of higher granular levels. Prices are now talked in a low- $140s/mid-$150s/t cfr range.\\nHowever crushed lump pricing is more opaque. Domestic prices are reported to be firming but there is an isolated report of a Chinese trader purchasing Russian product at $130-132/t cfr.\\nSinopec in China has raised its sulphur offer prices again. On 9 June, the price out of Wanzhou was raised by RMB10/t to RMB 1,200/t. The price out of Dazhou is RMB 1,190-1,200/t, an increase of RMB20-30/t.\\nAt Nantong port, offers for granular sulphur have reached\\nChina sulphur stocks vs sulphur import price cfr\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPhosphate market summary\\nThe global phosphates market is relatively balanced. Suppliers are comfortable and those with unsold tonnes, particularly for Latin America, are not under pressure in anticipation of further seasonal demand emerging. On the demand side, India and Latin America remain the focus although trade activity in India has slowed slightly on adequate supply for the kharif season.\\nBangladesh’s DAP/TSP tender continues to hold the mar- ket’s attention this week. The awards are expected to be confirmed in the next couple of weeks before shipping commences late June/early July. As it stands, if all those invited open l/cs, then it seems that China will mop up almost all the 400,000t DAP that Bangladesh has tendered for while some have indicated that Australian DAP could also be in the supply mix.\\nBased on this likely outcome, Chinese producers are set for a fairly comfortable Q3 against continued demand from India, Pakistan and Southeast Asia. Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time.\\nSo it is no surprise to see a slight firming in Chinese DAP prices to the mid-$460s/t fob minimum. This is in con- trast to reports in India of buyers countering offers with lower numbers below the mid-$470s/t cfr on account of adequate supplies for June/July. It is estimated that India has booked close to 3mn t during April-July. Moreover, concerns over the strength of the monsoon and a weak rupee are also playing a role in this downward price pres- sure being placed by the buyers. But in reality, barring a disastrous monsoon, suppliers know that India needs to buy another 2.5mn t this year. Factor in the additional demand from Saudi Arabia and China’s traditional demand markets during these next few months and an uptick in price seems more likely, albeit this will be limited and India pricing will depend on several key factors including the maximum retail price (MRP), the value of the Indian rupee and the strength of the monsoon.\\nMain Chinese Port Inventories (’000 t)\\nRMB 1,260/t, up noticeably on deals done in the RMB 1,190- 1,200/t ex-works last week. Crushed lumps are set RMB 40-70/t below this depending on type.\\nIt is estimated that the domestic price might move up soon because Aramco just announced $2/t increase for July ship- ments.\\nPort stocks have risen marginally this week by around 8,000t to 972,000t. Of the total, 340,000t are at Nantong, 80,000t at Qingdao, 157,000t at Fangcheng, 120,000t at Zhangjiang, 4,000t at Behai and 210,000t at Xhenjiang.\\nIndia\\nThere is plenty of talk regarding a prospective poor monsoon (latest estimates suggest a rainfall at 80-88pc of normal) but the impact of this on DAP consumption is still highly debatable. Bottom line the phosphates market has slowed because of high levels of buying in 1Q and early 2Q and the DAP import line up for India in June is healthy at 850,000t. Kharif is covered and thoughts are now turning to potential rabi demand. Some sources believe the sulphur market will be relatively quiet for June until phosphates demand picks up in July and August.\\nNevertheless, sulphur trade activity continues apace, with the following developments seen this week:\\n\\x84\\x84FACT closed a tender on 10 June for 25,000t for 6-10 July arrival.

While both producers acknowledged the decline in demand resulted from a slowing phosphates market, some considered the OSP too high, though it is thought to reﬂect Adnoc\\'s comfortable position. Tasweeq\\'s decision bafﬂed some as it is over $10/t lower than the most recent spot sale in the Middle East for 2H February loading, concluded at around $100/t fob.\\nThe price gap between the three monthly lifting prices is now wide at $26/t - a clear reﬂection of a weakening mar- ket. (See page 6 for comparisons of the three Middle East monthly prices since mid-2013.)\\nThere is a lack of demand for sulphur, which has led to prices falling day by day in some regions. In the Mediter- ranean, one trader said \"you have a price one day, it\\'s gone the next.\"\\nThe Chinese New Year holiday beginning later this week marks the start of two weeks of negligible demand in the\\nSulphur freight\\nPRICES\\ncpt = ‘carriage paid to’ for sulphur delivered by Roadtankcar\\nView the methodology used to assess sulphur prices at www.argusmedia.com/methodology.

The latest granular deals took place between the $90s/t and low-$100s/t cfr China as traders be- gin to liquidate, with spot crushed lump business concluded in the mid-$80s/t cfr. Molten sulphur trades have also moved down to the $80s/t cfr.\\nThe key problem is the significant fall in phosphates demand and prices. Following the Chinese, Mosaic in the US has an- nounced it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quarterly finished phosphate production capacity. The market now wonders who will follow Mosaic\\'s lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China. Therefore, this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the phosphates market, and further cutbacks - subsequently reduction in sulphur demand - should be expected.\\nPhosphates giant OCP\\'s sulphur procurement situation in 1Q is another sign that supply of sulphur is outstripping demand in North Africa. GazpromExport (GPE) has decided not to sell to OCP this quarter against contracts, mainly down to a disagreement in prices. But this is not going to put pres- sure on OCP as the buyer has been snapping up spot cargoes of crushed lumps and granular in the range of $95-105/t cfr with little difficulty. GPE does not seem to be stressed either with nothing heading to Morocco this quarter, because demand in domestic markets are said to be picking up and it plans to re-allocate the quantities elsewhere.\\nDry bulk freight rates still depressed\\nAt the start of this week, there was a brief period of increasing upwards pressure on dry bulk freight rates as bun- ker fuel prices ticked up, catching up with the rise in crude oil prices in the latter part of last week. This increase, however, was short-lived as crude prices began to sink on 2 February, bringing bunker prices with them, and with the Baltic Dry Index hitting yet another historical low on 1 Feb- ruary, freight rates have continued to be depressed.\\nIn an attempt to combat the problem of lower freight rates, ship owners, who are already operating on rates that are below opex, have begun the scrapping of ships and there has been a notable increase in layups. Layups in particular could change the face of the shipping industry but companies will face losing money in the meantime.\\nThere is some hope that grain shipments will help increase freight rates, as more dry bulk vessel capacity is chartered\\nbecause of poor monsoon seasons in India and drought in South Africa calling for greater grain procurement levels. But this may not be enough to have any impact in the long run.\\nThis week’s highlights\\n\\x84\\x84Granular sales in China concluded between $90s/t and\\nlow-$100s/t cfr...\\n\\x84\\x84...crushed lump and molten under greater pressure, slip- ping into the $80s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84Indian buyers bidding in mid-$110s/t cfr for small cargoes,\\nand around $100/t cfr for larger shipments...\\n\\x84\\x84...but demand for imports is negligible with many cov- ered under contracts.\\n\\x84\\x84India\\'s Reliance awarded its 25,000t tender, loading Bedi 14-18 February, in the mid/high-$90s/t fob.\\n\\x84\\x84Tasweeq\\'s Qatar Sulphur Price for February has been set at $89/t fob, down $30/t on January.\\n\\x84\\x84Kharg Island Petrochemical, Iran, has issued a tender for 2016 contractual cargoes, offering 70,000-140,000t fob Kharg Island.\\n\\x84\\x84Sinopec\\'s tender for 35,000t Yasref granular sulphur end February loading in Yanbu, awarded to end-user at an undis- closed price.\\n\\x84\\x84North Africa buy side indicating 1Q agreements with Mid-\\ndle East settled between $110s/t cfr and low-$120s/t cfr...\\n\\x84\\x84...sell side indicating mid/high-$120s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84FSU prices to North Africa for 1Q contracts indicated in the mid/high-$110s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84Tupras, Turkey, puts its February price down to TL 265/t fob.\\n\\x84\\x84Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed its acqui- sition by Pemex Fertilizantes.\\n\\x84\\x84Majority of Brazil 1Q price negotiations concluded in $110-125/t cfr range.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nPhosphate market summary\\nMosaic leads charge to rebalance market\\nThe market is to some extent still reeling from the signifi- cant price falls seen last week which wiped 10pc off the cfr values in Latin America. Latin American prices have continued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre.\\nWith DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotat- ing plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quarterly finished phosphate production capac- ity. The likely response will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encouraging more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit. But the question is who will follow Mosaic\\'s lead? The US is not the global phosphates superpower it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announce- ment in itself will not be enough to balance the market.\\nFundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American demand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.\\nMain Chinese Port Inventories (\\'000 t)\\nAsia\\nChina\\nGranular sales concluded between the $90s/t and low- $100s/t cfr\\nPrices are under pressure and traders are beginning to ac- cept the lower price ideas from buyers.\\nEarlier in the week, a full-sized granular sulphur cargoe was reportedly concluded at around $103/t cfr for February. Closer to the end of the week, a granular cargo is reported to have been finalised in the $90s/t cfr from a trader.\\nA cargo of crushed lump sulphur has been sold in the mid- $80s/t cfr.\\nMolten sulphur prices are also under pressure. Following last week\\'s sales in the mid-$90s/t, two molten vessels for March arrival have been concluded in the $80s/t cfr, although details were sketchy.\\nThere is market chatter that several uncommitted floaters are heading towards China, but trade there is expected to be muted in 1H February because of the national holiday.\\nSellers will have to look for alternative markets to absorb supply during the vacuum period in China. When Chinese buyers return from their holiday, they are likely to face similar, if not lower, price offers from Puguang as stocks will be growing between now and then, and high port invento- ries (now at 1.3mn t, up 23pc on last week with significant growth in Nantong and Fangcheng).\\nChinese domestic market weakens\\nSinopec\\'s Puguang lowered its domestic sulphur offers this week. Prices dropped to Yn880/t ex-Wanzhou, and fell to\\nChina sulphur stocks vs sulphur import price cfr\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nYn870/t ex-Dazhou.\\nDomestic trades at Nantong have taken place in the range Yn860-870/t ex-warehouse, a decrease on last week\\'s range of Yn870-910/t ex-warehouse. Around 15,000t have been sold early this week at Yn870/t ex-warehouse in Nantong, equiva- lent to the mid-$100s/t cfr with Yn1/$0.15.\\nIndia\\nBuyer price ideas moving down\\nPrice ideas from Indian sulphur importers lie in a wide range. Some have been bidding in the mid-$110s/t cfr for a few thousand tonnes of sulphur, and for larger sized cargoes price ideas are near $100/t cfr.\\nContainers were offered at $110-115/t cfr ex-Turkmenistan and ex-Iran earlier in the week, down on $115-117/t cfr indi- cated last week.\\nThe last concluded spot sale was from Swiss Singapore to CIL - 25,000t ex-Middle East finalised a few weeks back in the high-$120s/t cfr. The MV Orion Express will start loading 45,000t in Ruwais on 5 February to deliver 25,000t to CIL and the balance to Paradeep against contract.\\nThe following cargoes have been arranged to discharge in Paradeep:\\n\\x84\\x84The MV Navios Hios arrived on 31 January carrying 32,000t for IFFCO, and 8,000t for PPL, both loaded by Swiss Singapore in Jubail.\\n\\x84\\x84BGN is to ship 30,000t to PPL in at the end of February.\\n\\x84\\x84Swiss Singapore is to ship 30,000t to IFFCO at the end of February.\\n\\x84\\x84Swiss Singapore is to ship 30,000t to PPL in early March.\\nThe sugar refining season is expected to come to an end later this month/early March. Following that, demand for sulphur will be dependant on the upcoming phosphate fertil- izer season.\\nIndian 1Q DAP imports limited...\\nThe Indian Department of Fertilizers (DoF) has stopped the movement of imported DAP, NPK and MOP during February- March 2016. No formal notification has been issued, howev- er. The consequence is that DAP and MOP lying at the ports or warehouses in the country cannot be sold and transported into the interior.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nIt is further reported that the DoF will monitor the move- ment of domestic production. This will effectively reduce import demand for DAP, NPK and MOP to nil until end March.\\nDAP stocks are estimated at around 60,000t in various ports. Unsold stock of imported DAP, MOP and NPK lying at ports and warehouses will be subject to the new (likely reduced) subsidy which will be announced in early 2Q for the 2016-17 fertilizer year.\\n...Impact on sulphur to be monitored\\nDisregarding the decision by the DoF, DAP production rates in India have always been expected to be subdued in 1Q16 because of high DAP stocks and slow demand during the off season.\\nSomething the market will be watching closely is what will happen to OCP\\'s phosphoric acid deliveries to India in 2Q. The options are either for OCP to push through the quanti- ties to India, or to hold and delay negotiations.\\nReliance tender awarded in mid/high-$90s/t fob\\nNew Caledonia\\nWith an annual sulphur requirement of 300,000-400,000 t/ yr (and two cargoes required for 1Q for delivery at Proni), Vale New Caledonia completed its most recent purchase last week. The cargo will load in Vancouver, with the price heard at $100/t fob, freight estimated at $10-12/t.\\nIndonesia\\nVale\\'s Indonesia operation, with sulphur requirement of 60,000 t/yr, already committed to a cargo that loaded in January.\\nJapan\\nFull year exports down 2pc in 2015\\nIn 2015, Japan exported just under 1.2mn t of sulphur, down slightly by 2pc on the previous year.\\nChina continued to be the biggest export market discharg- ing 996,000t of Japanese sulphur, down 2pc on 2014. A few Japanese cargoes were sent to India last year, totalling 75,000t, an increase of 109pc on 2014 volumes.\\nThe Reliance e-auction is understood to have been sold in the mid/high-$90s/t fob to a Chinese trader. The cargo is for 25,000t, loading in Bedi on 14-18 February.\\nSNAPSHOT - SPOT GRANULAR PRICES/NETBACKS\\nExports to Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines increased between 73pc and 263pc in 2015, compared to the prior- year.\\nIn December 2015, Japan exported just under 85,000t of\\n$100-105/t fob\\nVancouver\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nMiddle East\\nArgus FMB assessed the Middle East spot prices at $99-101/t fob this week, with one 2H February loader recently con- cluded at around $100/t fob. A firm bid for late-February/ early-March loading was at near $90/t fob but it was unclear if that was accepted by the seller.\\nContract settlements in 1Q\\nThere are contrasting reports for 1Q contract prices be- tween Middle East producers and North African buyers. The buy side has indicated agreements between the $110s/t and the low-$120s/t cfr; the sell side indicating the mid/ high-$120s/t cfr.

It is further reported that the DoF will monitor the movement of domestic production, which will effectively reduce import demand for DAP to nil until end-March. Domestic DAP production during 1Q has been expected to be insignificant. All these beg the question of what OCP will decide to do with its phosphoric acid ship- ments to India in 2Q, which will have a knock on effect on OCP\\'s output and raw material consumption.\\nSpot prices in Morocco have been indicated between the mid-$90s/t and the mid-$100s/t cfr.\\nA cargo of 30,000t of sulphur will be going to OCP ex-Ust Luga, including Russian and Kazakh tonnes.

Conditions have been placed on imports - including the establishment of a register in the General Organisation for Export and Import Control - which will monitor the safety conditions\\nof factories exporting to the country. This is in addition to tightened measures imposed by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), because of the shortage of foreign currency, par- ticularly US dollars, in Egypt. Since the Arab Spring in 2011, tourists and foreign investments have dwindled, and foreign cash reserves dropped to around $16.4bn at the end of last year from $36bn prior to the uprising. The CBE now requires importers to provide 100pc cash deposits to banks on their letters of credit, up from 50pc previously. With this the bank is aiming to reduce import levels by $20bn in 2016, down from $80bn in 2015, therefore bolstering foreign currency reserves and encouraging domestic production and trade.\\nThere has, however, been some respite for traders and importers as the CBE increased its maximum deposit limit in foreign currencies to $250,000/month on 3 February from $50,000/month.\\nIssue 16-05\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 4 February 2016\\nLibya\\nThe most recent offers from NOC are understood to be 2 x 8,000t for end-February/early-March loading in Mellitah.

At TL 1/$0.34, the February price is equivalent to around $90/t fob. This is equivalent to the $100s/t cfr Turkey for local buyers.\\nOn 3 February a fire broke out at the Izmit refinery in the Kocaeli Gulf region of Turkey. The fire was extinguished by 11pm the same evening and Tupras said other refinery opera- tions were continuing as planned. Interruption of sulphur production is believed to be minor. The fire started because of a flaring equipment failure. The Izmit refinery has re- cently increased its sulphur production to 220,000 t/yr, over half of which is for the domestic market.\\nToros looking for March delivery\\nToros was looking for around 15,000t for March delivery, tar- geting in the $100s/t cfr, but scrapped the tender. Another enquiry is expected to be floated soon.\\nBulgaria\\nFollowing last week\\'s report, the latest Burgas tender for 6,000t of granular sulphur was awarded at below $100/t fob, instead of $100/t cfr. This compared with the previous ten- der sale at around $110/t fob. The vessel loaded this week for shipment to Toros in Turkey.\\nWest Europe\\nOutstanding 1Q contracts in the Benelux have been conclud- ed at a decrease of $5/t.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphur\\nNetherlands\\nGunvor Group acquires Europoort refinery\\nGeneva-based trading firm Gunvor Group completed the acquisition of the Europoort refinery, Rotterdam, from Ku- wait Petroleum International on 1 February. The 88,000 b/d refinery was put up for sale in 2014 following KPC’s decision not to go ahead with an upgrade programme at the facil- ity. The refinery will now be known as Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam and become part of Gunvor’s existing European refining network which includes plants in Antwerp, Belgium and Ingolstadt, Germany.\\nSulphur production capacity there is estimated at 172 t/d - around 22,000t were produced in 2014. It remains to be seen how the recovery of sulphur will be affected depending on Gunvor\\'s decision on the refinery output.\\nGunvor will retain the site as a refinery, but bitumen, base oils and waxes production have already been phased out as planned by the new owners. The second crude unit at the plant is now to run middle distillate rich crudes for the production of gasoil, diesel and jet fuel.\\nIssue 16-05\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 4 February 2016\\nBelgium took receipt of the majority of the export volume at around 110,000, up 10pc on the year.

This is the second bomb threat to the 115,000 b/d refinery, following one in October 2015. The bomb threat procedure was activated and an extensive search of the refinery was conducted. Normal operations resumed shortly after the all clear was issued by North Atlantic Refining later that day and an investigation into the origin of the threat is reportedly ongoing.\\nLatin America\\nMexico\\nPemex acquires Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal\\nMexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.\\n\"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes,\" Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. \"This acquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to\\nIssue 16-05\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 4 February 2016\\nbecome a low cost producer and a stronger competitor.\"\\nThe acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.\\nFertinal, Mexico\\'s lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices. The company\\'s phosphate rock mine in Baja California Sur, Mexico, was impacted by a hurricane and a fire in late 2014, which decreased production.\\nPotential changes to Fertinal\\'s sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement?\\nFertinal is a consumer of sulphur and sulphuric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers. The company will continue to build \"business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers\", according to a recent statement, indicating its ways of procurement may not change substan- tially in the near term.\\nIn 2015, the company imported around 445,000t of sulphur, and 180,000-185,000t of sulphuric acid via the port of Lazaro Cardenas. Most of its sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement in the past had been conducted via traders on a spot basis.\\nSulphur is produced locally in Mexico from natural gas processing and oil refining, and all refineries in Mexico are owned by Pemex. At present the only outlets for Pemex\\'s sulphur production are the domestic market or the move- ment of molten sulphur by vessel to the US for two key fertilizer producers: Mosaic and PotashCorp.\\nLogistical constraints had prevented Fertinal from receiv- ing significant quantities of sulphur from Pemex in the past. While it makes sense for Fertinal to be self-sufficient with Pemex\\'s sulphur in the future, investments are needed to improve transportation to and from the Fertinal units and within Mexico.\\nIf this happens, domestic trade flow may change and it may have a knock-on effect on the utilisation of Mexico\\'s first sul- phur forming capacity, which is expected to come on stream in the first half of 2016 with capacity of 360,000 t/yr.\\nThe forming unit is located at Coatzacoalcos in south Mexico on the Atlantic coast and is also owned by Pemex. Its start up should allow sulphur production unconsumed by the local market to move offshore. But its utilisation is subjected to change depending on Fertinal\\'s future sulphur procurement\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nstrategy.\\nAs for sulphuric acid, Fertinal produces sulphur-based acid and augments its requirements with imports. The cargoes typically come from the Far East, delivered via chemical tankers and combo vessels (which is capable of transporting acid from Japan/South Korea to Latin America and copper concentrate on its voyage back).\\nLogistical disadvantages again made it more economical for Fertinal to import acid rather than receive domestic product via tanker trucks in the past.\\nWith the acquisition, it remains to be seen if a partnership is possible with local smelter acid producer Southern Cop- per/Grupo Mexico. The company operates two mines that produces smelter acid in Mexico - La Caridad in Nacozari and Buenavista in Cananea, both in Sonora.\\nAnother potential partnership could be with El Boleo, a copper producer that exported an estimated 200,000t of sulphur-based sulphuric acid via the port of Santa Rosalia to nearby markets in 2015.\\nSupplies from either Grupo Mexico or El Boleo will face a similar problem: high freight costs because of a limited number of chemical tankers serving the west coast of Latin America.\\nFor now, Fertinal is estimated to be covered with sulphur and sulphuric acid until around March.\\nJan-Nov sulphur imports up 69pc\\nBetween January and November Mexico imported just under 538,000t of sulphur, an increase of 69pc on the prior-year period. Canada provided 55pc of the country\\'s requirements in the first 11 months of 2015, totalling 298,000t, up 93pc on 2014 volumes. The US provided the remaining 240,000t, up 56pc on 2014 export volumes.\\nIn November 2015, Mexico received just under 29,0000t of sulphur from the US.\\nBrazil\\nMexico Sulphur Imports ’000t\\nMost of the quarterly price negotiations have been conclud- ed in Brazil in the range of $110-125/t cfr. The top end refers to cargoes closed between December and early January, while the more recent deals were finalised at the low end of the range.\\nFor Vale, it is believed that one cargo has yet to be com- mitted out of Vale\\'s estimated requirements of 293,000t for 1Q. The most recently finalised cargo is of US Gulf origin, thought to be concluded at around $100/t fob US Gulf. Freight is put at $12/t.\\nThe most recent purchase by Anglo American is from Tram- mo, 35,000-39,000t for April arrival.

One deal this week is Petro- bras’ tender for 15,000t, which is understood to have been awarded to a trader sourcing acid from NW Europe. It will leave Antwerp, Belgium on 1-5 July for arrival in Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil in late July. Prices have been heard at around $85/t cfr.\\nMeanwhile in Asia, 100,000t were sold to traders for delivery in the second half of the year, as reported last week. The acid will be sourced from two separate Far East Asian smelt- er acid producers. The price on the cargoes is understood to be in the range of $30-32/t fob.\\nProducers in East Asia and NW Europe now talk of being sold out for the near future, while receiving little to no spot en- quiries. Low demand, coupled with limited spot availability, resulted in price stability as seen in recent weeks. Traders as a result appear unwilling to pay over $30/t fob for Far Eastern smelter acid; producers in NW Europe appear unwill- ing to sell below $40/t fob.\\nOn the demand side, most of the regular channels of de- mand are quieting down. OCP in Morocco is understood to be covered, as are most consumers in Brazil. Most buyers in India, with the exception of Coromandel, are also under- stood to be moving away from the market. The US market remains steady.\\nThe talking point now is the future of Asian supply and demand moving into 2H 2015. The return of PASAR acid to the market will coincide with turnarounds at Saganoseki and Niihama smelters in Japan. As a result, market participants are operating on a wait-and-see basis as the forecast is unclear at present.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: Lack of demand is halting upward price move- ment.\\nprICES\\nSulphuric acid contract prices - cfr\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nHighlights this week\\n\\x84\\x8415,000t will be shipped out of Antwerp, Belgium via a trader on the AS Olivia to Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil, loading 1-5 July.

Recent spot deals for June loading in the Middle East have steadily moved up and have mostly been concluded in the range of $143-148/t fob, and offers into China have subsequently moved up to $158-163/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: Signs of interest in China, but it is not known how long this will last.\\nDemand - Leaching and industrial\\n\\x84\\x84Two Far East Asian smelter acid producers sold 100,000t to traders for 2H 2015 shipment.

The volume placed by OCP – 240,000t for June – is high. The key focus in this region is the strength of demand\\nin Brazil. It is clear that Brazil still needs to buy but con- cerns over crop pricing and the Brazilian real could hamper this demand to an extent. In terms of pricing, suppliers ap- pear to be maintaining current levels around $500/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84Pakistan has also been active, with another Saudi DAP cargo placed into the market for June. Latest NFDC data\\nwould appear to support the view that supplies will be\\npretty thin for end kharif, necessitating additional imports in Q3.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: The market will be stable-to-firm through Q3\\nsupported by continuing buying in Latin America and India.\\nBrazil – Petrobras’ will \\nfrom NW Europe.

The company also has a planned turnaround sched- uled for September, reportedly lasting one month.\\nArgentina\\nArgentinian fertilizer producer Bunge will receive 16,000t acid from NW Europe via a trader. The cargo is due to load onto the Bochem Antwerp in late June in Hamburg, Ger-\\nmany, for shipment to Ramallo/Quebracho, Argentina. It is rumoured that this a vessel has been fixed close to $90/t cfr Ramallo/Quebracho, though further details are pending. Bunge is understood to be looking for another spot cargo of 15,000t for shipment during the first half of August.\\nMexico\\nOne of the two sulphuric acid plants operated by Mexican fertilizer producer Fertinal may undergo a refurbishment in the coming months. It has not yet been confirmed, but a decision is expected to be made by the end of June.\\nIf the refurbishment goes ahead, the company will likely need to increase the number of cargoes it takes from offshore. Currently, Fertinal buys one to two cargoes per quarter, but it may need three or four should the plant halt\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\noperation. The company will look to put the plant under maintenance during 4Q 2015, rather than 3Q, as phosphate sales are seasonally lower at the end of the year.\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nThe shutdown of PotashCorp’s (PCS) Geismar, Louisiana, sulphur-burning sulphuric acid plant, due to occur at the end of May, has been pushed back another month to the end of June. The reasons for this delay are not currently known. The closure of the plant will mean around 140,000 t/yr of smelter acid will be lost from the market. The drop off of tonnage may mean that PCS will look to the offshore spot market for tonnage.\\nAfrica and Mediterranean\\nMorocco\\nDemand from Morocco is understood to be weak at present, as the company has begun acid production at its new sul- phur burner, part of a larger fertilizer plant that will supply DAP, MAP and NPKs to the African market. In 1Q, there was steady spot demand from fertilizer giant OCP in Morocco keeping producers comfortable in northwest Europe.\\nOCP will likely stockpile acid produced by its new plant for the coming weeks until the phosphoric acid and granulation plants begin operation. As a result, market players in Europe expect demand from OCP to drop further moving into 2H 2015. Between now and 2016, the company will build four new fertilizer plants, accompanied by sulphur burners.\\nSpain\\nA player in Spain suggests low availability may become an is- sue for contractual shipments. Sellers have spoken of receiv- ing continued spot enquiries for small lots of acid to North African countries (outside Morocco).\\nEurope\\nNW Europe\\nEuropean producers have spoken of receiving no spot enqui- ries this week, with some producers suggesting that smelter acid supply may be loosening up a small amount.\\nThe market in NW Europe has nevertheless remained stable, with market players suggesting no change to the prevailing fob NW Europe range of $30-37/t fob.\\nThe AS Olivia will load 15,000t out of Antwerp, Belgium for shipment to Petrobras, arriving at Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil in late July. The cargo will load 1-5 July, and is under- stood to have been sold to a trader in the mid/high0-$80s/t cfr Barra dos Coqueiros, which would give a NW Europe fob netback of around $35-40/t.\\nBunge will receive 16,000t acid from Antwerp, Belgium via a trader on the Bochem Antwerp, loading in late June in Hamburg, Germany, for shipment to Ramallo/Quebracho, Argentina. It is rumoured that this vessel was fixed close to $90/t cfr Ramallo/Quebracho.\\nBoliden\\'s Harjavalta smelter in Finland, which began a planned maintenance in mid-May, is understood to be partially running, and will return to full capacity within the coming few weeks. It is not known how much acid was lost, but the company is understood to have stockpiled in prepa- ration for contractual deliveries.\\nSo2 emissions ruling has little effect six months on\\nOn 1 January 2015, a ruling was put in place regarding sulphur emissions in shipping fuel in the Emission Control Area (ECA). The legislation stipulated that ships trading in the Area (NW Europe and oceanic waters surrounding the US) would be forced to use fuel oil with a sulphur content no higher than 0.1pc, down from the previous limit of 1pc used up to 31 December 2014. Marine Gas Oil and other similar products will instead be used for shipping due to their zero sulphur content and trace amounts of sulphur oxide emis- sions when ignited.\\nIt had been suggested that a freight cost increase of 1.5-2pc would result, and some quoted increases as great as 10-15pc, which would have had a significant effect on the European commodities market.\\nAsia\\nChina\\nTwo Lions in China is understood to have sold eight cargoes in 2015. These are understood to have all gone to traders for shipment to India or southeast Asia, with the most recent completed deal due to load in late June for shipment to Kimaman, Malaysia.\\nTwo Lions has said that it does not intend to export any more cargoes for the time being, as it expects demand from the Chinese domestic market to increase in the com- ing months. The company has also stated that its inventory\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nlevels are currently low. Seller price target is in the range of $48-50/t fob Zhangjiagang.\\nIn Henan Province, state-owned metal company China Metallurgical Group has opened a new 1.2mn t/yr capacity smelter. The smelter will supply the Chinese domestic mar- ket (so no impact on global trade), and will reportedly affect supply in Henan and Shandong provinces, where domestic prices have been heard at RMB 330-390/t ($53-63/t) exw for smelter acid.\\nJinchuan Non-Ferrous Metals Corp is understood to have high stocks at its smelter in Gansu province, which produces around 180,000 t/yr acid. As a result of the high stocks, acid prices out of Jinchuan’s smelter have been heard at as low as RMB 190-230/t exw, almost half that of prices in Shandong Province. This smelter services on the domestic market.\\nIn more international terms, buyers and sellers in the region will be re-entering contract negotiations for the third quar- ter of 2015 within the next two weeks, and local sources within China have stated that the outcome will likely be a decrease from the previous quarterly contract price of $27- 32/t cfr China, on low demand from buyers.\\nHowever, producers in Japan and Korea have seen tightness throughout 2015 so far, which has pushed spot prices up to $32/t fob Japan/Korea since the previous round of contract negotiations.\\nJapan/South Korea\\nAs reported last week, a number of cargoes have been sold from two separate Far Eastern smelters to traders. Overall, 100,000t have been sold, for delivery in the second half of the year. The price on the cargoes is understood to be in the region of $30-32/t fob.\\nPlayers in the region do not forecast much upward price movement in the Far East, mainly because of the upcoming return of PASAR acid to the market. The PASAR smelter in the Philippines - owned by Glencore - will return to produc- tion in July, following a large-scale expansion to the plant\\'s capacity. Ramping-up to the smelter\\'s revised output of 1.1mn t/yr will likely not be completed until at least 4Q 2015.\\nHowever, market participants have also suggested that PASAR\\'s return will again be balanced out by turnarounds at smelters in Japan, also in 4Q 2015. In October or November, a turnaround will start at PPC\\'s Saganoseki smelter, which\\nwill reportedly last around 40 days. The smelter produces around 120,000 t/month. In the same timeframe, Sumi- tomo\\'s Niihama smelter will undergo a 20-day turnaround. Niihama also produces approximately 120,000 t/month. This will likely keep the acid market in Asia balanced, temporar- ily cancelling out the surplus brought back into the market by PASAR. As a result, producers and traders alike remain cautious to predict any price movement at present, and are taking a wait-and-see approach for the time being.\\nA freight fixture has been completed from Saganoseki to a trader. 19,000t is to be shipped to Map Ta Phut, Thailand, loading end June.\\nAnother 19,000t will be shipped from Saganoseki to Paradeep, India, though a vessel has not been fixed yet. These are believed to be spot purchases.\\nIndia\\nPPL’s new sulphuric acid plant, which has seen numerous setbacks since construction began, is predicted to begin operation in the first half of August. The plant was originally due to open in December 2014.\\nMost buyers are believed to be covered, which has pushed bids down toward the low-$60s/t cfr. As a result of this - and the country’s current weather problems - demand is low at present. Coromandel is reported to still be in the spot mar- ket for 2H delivery of 80,000t.\\nIt is understood that a cargo fixed for PPL was forced to be redirected following issues at PPL’s facility. The cargo, shipped on the vessel the Fairchem Steed, was understood to have been reverted to IFFCO. However, some local market sources have said that the cargo may have been diverted to the port of Kolkata, where it is currently stationary with no buyer.\\nCurrently, the weather in India is causing growing concern amongst market participants. The monsoon season, which was due to start in Kerala on 1 June, has been delayed by 5 days, and is now expected to start on 5 June. Furthermore, the forecast has been revised; originally a 93pc monsoon was expected, but this has been lowered to 88pc. The India Meteorological Department’s guidelines state that a monsoon lower than 90pc is considered a drought year, and the delay to the monsoon has also prolonged the country’s current severe heatwave, which is halting industry including agriculture.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphuric Acid\\nImport and Export data - Asia\\n\\x84\\x84Japan\\'s sulphuric acid exports from January to April 2015 totalled 213,000t, according to the Japanese Ministry of Finance, down 6pc from the corresponding period of 2014.\\nIssue 15-22 | Thursday 4 June 2015\\nIndia: sulphuric acid discharge/arrivals in May-Jun 2015\\n\\x84\\x84The Philippines has already imported more than 430,000t of Japanese acid in this period, with the majority of it understood to be heading to the Taganito nickel-leaching project.\\n\\x84\\x84Exports to Chile have dropped noticeably compared to last year\\'s figures, showing a 25pc drop.

Brazil imported over 320,000t of sulphuric acid in the first half of 2015, based on total ship- ments arriving in Brazil, which is up a sharp 68pc on 1H 2014 (totalling around 190,000t). Despite the increase of spot enquiries (and the fact that Europe fulfils most of Brazil’s requirements), spot prices there have been relatively stable and the latest business confirmed to be done was in the prevailing range of $83-88/t cfr.\\nAsia is also balanced. The previous tightness in Asia, as tes- tified by around eight sulphur-based acid cargoes being sold by Chinese producer Two Lions since the start of 2015, has eased. Two recent spot tenders in the Far East, where two smelters have sold 60,000t and 40,000t of acid for 2H 2015 lifting, were concluded between $30/t and the low-$30s/t cfr. This suggests that the traders who took these forward loading cargoes are unwilling to pay higher than the current spot Japan/South Korea assessment for the remainder of the year. The restart of the Pasar smelter in the Philippines, still scheduled to be in July, and the shutdown of two Japanese smelters in the final quarter, may cancel each other out and result in a stable Asian acid market in the second half of the year.\\nThere is a noticeable trend in the acid trade as more direct contractual business is being agreed between producers and buyers, particularly those who are consuming significant quantities. An example is fertilizer giant OCP, who already has contracts with producers in Bulgaria and Spain and is understood to be in discussions with other acid producers for long-term supply contracts.\\nNews of Nyrstar’s plan to operate three 20,000t sulphuric acid tanks in Antwerp by the end of 1Q 2016 also extends a trend that the market has seen in recent years - producers and suppliers working on improving their logistical flexibil- ity, adding value to their service and working directly with end-users.\\nprICES\\nSulphuric acid contract prices - cfr\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: A balanced market in the east and the west testified by stable prices despite stronger-than-expected demand in India and Brazil recently.

Moreover, Latin American MAP demand will also provide some Chinese producers with an additional outlet although this shipping window will likely close before the end of July for the product to arrive in time.\\n\\x84\\x84Elsewhere on the supply side, the Saudis have made a partial switch to MAP which will limit DAP supply for India and Pakistan while the Moroccans are sold out for June.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: The global market will still be stable-to-firm.\\nBelgium – Nyrstar plans to \\nChile – A sale of \\nacid has been complet- ed by a smelter acid producer, reportedly to BHP Billiton.

Some buyers have had to sell tonnes/buy tonnes off other consumers, others delaying their import needs that were previously anticipated to materialise by the second half of 2015.\\nAround 10,000t of Chilean sulphuric acid have been sold by a major producer, reportedly to BHP Billiton, in the mid-$70s/t cfr for July arrival.\\nThe last time the buyer was linked to spot buying was for imported tonnes for end-May delivery, concluded in the\\nhigh-$70s/t cfr with a trader. Before that, Zaldivar sold 10,000t of acid to KGHM\\'s Franke mine in early/mid-April at $76/t fca (equivalent to the very low-$70s/t cfr Mejillones).\\nArgus FMB has assessed the Chilean cfr spot price down to $70-79/t to reflect the current market sentiment in Chile. A producer suggests that buyers, who have little need for spot tonnes at present, are looking to buy at under $70/t cfr.\\nThe softer prices in Chile have also been attributed by some to the Antofagasta’s Antucoya project that is still in the process of ramping up production. This suggests that some of the sulphuric acid meant for Antucoya has had to be diverted. Most of the acid diverted went to Antofagasta’s other two operations, Michilla and Centinela, and there are reports of some tonnes having to be diverted to other mar- ket players hence putting downward pressure on spot prices.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nThe operation has a nameplate consumption rate of 450,000- 500,000 t/yr of acid.\\nDraft restriction still in place in Barquito\\nThe effects of the March flooding are still lingering in some parts of Chile. In Barquito, the local authority has kept the 8m draft restriction in place, while the Ferronor rail line remains closed indefinitely. The rail line - part of which is owned by Codelco and services the Potrerillos smelter - is undergoing a major repair operation which will cost up to $1.5mn/km of track repaired.\\nBut despite the Ferronor rail line being down, Codelco has been meeting its sulphuric acid deliveries ex-Potrerillos to customers via truck, which began on 29 April.\\navailability of sulphur-based acid for export should theoreti- cally be down as well.\\nBoleo produced its first copper in 1Q 2015 and mining opera- tions already started in the first semester of 2014. The proj- ect sources prilled sulphur from Oxbow out of North America and will be capable of producing up to 700,000-800,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid.\\nBrazil\\nParanapanema is currently taking delivery of 8,000t on the MTM Penang at Aratu.\\nYara is understood to be looking for spot tonnage for July delivery.\\nMexico\\nAround eight shipments have been shipped out of Santa Rosalia, where Minera y Metalúrgica del Boleo (Boleo) runs a copper leaching operation, since the beginning of this year.\\nIn January, the Bochem Singapura went to Rio Grande. The Mid Fortune delivered some acid to Chile in late January/ early February. In mid-February the Chemstar Massa went to Chile. Fairchem Silver loaded acid in March, April and May for shipment to Chile. Chemstar Stellar loaded in early April and first half of June, also for shipment to Chile.\\nThis contributed to the sharp jump in acid deliveries from Mexico to Chile in the first four months of the year. Chile customs data showed that 778,000t of sulphuric acid were delivered to Chile in January-April, and 15pc of the total, or 118,000t came from Mexico. Grupo Mexico is another sup- plier of sulphuric acid to Chilean buyers but the quantities have dropped since 2012 as more shipments went to Chile from Grupo Mexico’s subsidiary in Peru: Southern Copper Corporation.\\nBut Boleo exports is not expected to be a long-term trend going forward.\\nBoleo is running its sulphur burner at a high rate in order to benefit from the steam credit, as there is no external energy available in the vicinity of the operation. Its copper leach- ing operation is estimated to be consuming around 15,000 t/month of sulphuric acid at present and will be ramping up its operating rates by June 2015. At present, the leach- ing plant is consuming less than the acid plant is producing, and as a result the company has been left with an excess of sulphur-based acid. Once the leaching unit is ramped up,\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nIn the freight market, the MTM Houston has been fixed to deliver 19,000t from Pori, Finland or Ronnskar, Sweden, to east coast US via a trader.\\nThe cargo will load between 1 and 10 July, and the freight is understood to be around $44/t. Currently, freight rates from Benelux to the USG are estimated at $38-42/t.\\nMarket participants agree that the US import price range remains at $70-80/t cfr.\\nAfrica and Mediterranean\\nMorocco\\nThere have been discussions again regarding OCP’s sulphuric acid requirements this year as OCP’s new finished fertilizer complex is on target to come on stream within 2015.\\nThere are expectations for the fertilizer giant to import at least 600,000t of sulphuric acid this year, and majority of that should come under contracts with acid producers direct.\\nThe granulation unit – part of the new fertilizer complex - will be online early July; the accompanying sulphuric acid plant is already operational and the phosphoric acid unit will be on stream sometime in June. This fertilizer unit is fully dedicated to Africa and is flexible in producing DAP/MAP/ NPK and NPS, therefore it remains to be seen how much sulphuric acid OCP will require.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nLast year was an unusual year as Morocco imported around 890,000t of acid according to customs data; for 2012 and 2013 Morocco’s imports averaged 500,000t on an annual ba- sis. Many are sceptical that OCP will need 800,000-900,000t of sulphuric acid again this year with a new sulphuric acid plant now operational.\\nThere are indications that recent spot business going into North Africa is still in the range of $50-60/t cfr, while con- tractual levels are close to $40/t cfr.\\nEurope\\nNyrstar builds three tanks in Antwerp\\nNyrstar is building 3 x 20,000t sulphuric acid storage tanks at the port of Antwerp, Belgium. The tanks are expected to be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The storage capacity will receive production from Nyrstar’s Balen zinc smelter in Belgium and Budel zinc smelter in the Netherlands.\\nThe smelter acid producer sometimes exports out of Ant- werp but this activity is restricted by barge traffic: there are understood to be around 11 barges available, each taking around 450t, servicing between its smelters and Antwerp. With the new storage capacity, the flow of barge traffic should even out throughout the year, potentially opening up more export opportunities for the producer.\\nThis continues a trend that has been seen in the past year or two, as more tanks are being planned/built or leased out as sulphuric acid producers and suppliers work on improving their logistical flexibility and adding value to their existing service. As previously reported, in Chile Puerto Mejillones and Interacid are building one tank each at their terminals. In the US, October 2014 saw Westway Group commission four sulphuric acid storage tanks in Houston, Texas, with a com- bined capacity of about 30,000t, which is leased by Glen- core. SATCO, a subsidiary of Interacid, added a sulphuric acid tank earlier this year with capacity of about 20,000t in Mobile, Alabama.\\nForce majeure declared at Chemie Kelheim\\nChemie Kelheim Holding\\'s sulphur burner in Kelheim, Ger- many halted operations on 9 June and subsequently declared force majeure on sulphuric acid deliveries. During a planned two-week turnaround at one of the two sulphuric acid lines, which began on 6 June, the second line suffered technical problems and went down on 9 June and remained offline at\\npress time. The sulphur burner has a normal production rate of 120,000 t/yr sulphur-based acid, most of which goes to the domestic market. While it is unclear how much produc- tion has been lost as a whole, there are expectations that the operations can resume in two weeks\\' time.\\nSachtleben Chemie running at reduced rates\\nThe Duisburg sulphuric acid plant, also in Germany and owned by Sachtleben Chemie, is running at reduced rates because one of the two ovens is reportedly down, though reasons are not known. The unit has a capacity to produce 100,000 t/yr of sulphur-based acid and 250,000 t/yr of re- covered/regenerated acid.\\nEuropean contract negotiations for 3Q/2H to begin\\nThird-quarter and second-half contract negotiations will begin soon and, compared with the second quarter, a more optimistic sign is that the euro has strengthened against the US dollar.\\nIn terms of market fundamentals, a majority from the buy and sell sides agree that the European domestic market is in balance at present. Suppliers and buyers suggest that if any- one needs tonnage, there is not a lack of product available.\\nProducers and suppliers are likely to be targeting a slight in- crease for 3Q/2H contracts. For buyers, a decrease has been voiced by several players. What happens with molten sulphur contract prices in the third quarter will also have a bearing on smelter acid contract price negotiations. Second quarter acid prices were rolled over from the first quarter.\\nKGHM replaces flash furnace in 2016\\nKGHM has plans to put in a flash furnace at its Glogow smelter in the second half of 2016.

Earlier in 2Q, producers were ready to refuse bids below $40/t fob NW Europe, but some sources have revised this down to the mid-$30s/t fob.\\nThere are two recent spot sales of smelter acid to OCP in Morocco, sourced from Nordenham, Germany and Kris- tiansand, Norway. The cargoes are 6,000t and 7,000t respec- tively, and will load in the next few weeks. They are both understood to fall within the current North Africa cfr range of $50-60/t cfr Jorf Lasfar.\\nWhat this also shows is that demand is also still prevalent for European acid. OCP is still buying acid from offshore while two Brazilian buyers are back in the market. First is Mosaic, which closed a tender on 18 June for 10,000-12,000t for August delivery, and Petrobras is looking to establish a year- long contract for 4 x 15,000t shipments. The delivery date for these four cargoes is understood to start in 4Q 2015.\\nIn India, PPL having bought another cargo of 18,000t smelter acid from a Far East Asian producer. The cargo was sold via a trader and is understood to have been completed in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India. The cargo is understood to be a distressed cargo and sold at a low fob level, and there- fore is not indicative of the current price range for South Korea/Japan or India.\\nPPC in Japan is also understood to have sold a spot cargo to a Chinese buyer for under $40/t cfr.\\nOutlook: stable and balanced, with supply loosening up a little.\\nprICES\\nSulphuric acid contract prices - cfr\\nCopyright © 2015 Argus Media Ltd\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nHighlights this week\\n\\x84\\x84PPC sold a 19,000t cargo to a buyer in China for under- $40/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84A producer has sold a distressed cargo of 18,000t via a trader to PPL in India from the Far East. The price is understood to be in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India, well below the current range.\\n\\x84\\x84OCP has purchased two spot cargoes from NW European smelters, due to load in June and July.\\nQatar’s Tasweeq is thought to have made an award to a trader for second half July loading.\\n\\x84\\x84When China failed to return to the spot market as an- ticipated after the Chinese New Year in February, prices eroded slightly but did not enter a free-fall. Some argue that it was down to a structural market tightness, which is expected to provide support to sulphur prices and poten- tially to prevent prices from falling sharply even if Chinese buyers decide to withdraw from the market in the next few weeks.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: Prices slowly edging up.\\nFundamentals\\nSupply - Metals and ores\\n\\x84\\x84Chinese imports of copper ore fell 5.7pc in May when compared to the previous month, though the total pattern of the last year shows a 40pc increase on ore imports in May 2014, showing a large overall rise in recent months.\\nSupply - Sulphur\\n\\x84\\x84In China this week, various deals for granular sulphur have been reported in the $160-163/t cfr range, showing a slight increase on last week.\\n\\x84\\x84Aramco Trading in Saudi Arabia has sold 35,000t of spot sulphur to a trader in the high-$140s/t fob, and this is be- lieved to be coming from Yasref for July loading in Yanbu.\\nSpot freight $/t\\n18-Jun 11-Jun +/- ($)\\nNW Europe\\nDemand - Leaching and industrial\\n\\x84\\x84Copper prices took a fall this week on economic cues re- lating to US interest rates and Greek debt talks. The metal settled on 18 June at $2,080/t, a three-month low.\\n\\x84\\x84Nickel prices saw a similar drop for the same reasons as copper, falling to $12,580/t on 18 June.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n\\x84\\x84There is a slightly more bearish tone in Brazil this week with reports of some offers dropping to the $490s/t cfr but these are likely from floaters.\\n\\x84\\x84In India, demand currently is slow as buyers are well- covered for the kharif season and importers feel time is on their side to purchase for the rabi season. Indeed, over 3mn t is estimated to be lined up for April-July and some suggest that the Indians could be in a position to continue to sit out in July if prices are not favourable.\\n\\x84\\x84Outlook: market to remain stable-to-firm through 3Q.\\n\\x84\\x84Zinc also hit a two-month low of $2,080/t on 18 June, following in the path of the other two base metals listed above.\\nDemand - Fertilizers and agriculture\\n\\x84\\x84In phosphates, Brazil and India are still in a hiatus period against relatively comfortable suppliers. However, trade activity has picked up in several other markets including Argentina, Turkey, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.\\nSulphuric acid this week\\nSouth America\\nBrazil\\nDemand remains stable in Brazil, as two buyers have re- turned to the market.\\nThe first is fertilizer producer Mosaic, which will close a ten- der on 18 June for 10,000-12,000t. The cargo is requested to arrive at Paranagua, Brazil in August. Seller price indications have been quoted in the low/mid-$80s/t cfr Paranagua.\\nMorocco – OCP is continuing to buy spot acid, and is due to receive 6,000t ex-Nordenham, Germany in end-June, along with another cargo, of 7,000t from Kristiansand in Norway\\nBrazil – Petrobras and Mosaic in Brazil are both in the market. Mosaic’s is for 10- 12,000t for August de- livery, while Petrobras looking to establish a year-long contract for\\n4 x 15,000t for delivery starting in 4Q 2015.\\nIndia – PPL has purchased a distressed cargo of 18,000t from a trader for Far East smelter acid in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India. \\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nThe second enquiry was issued by energy company Petro- bras. The acid byer wants to establish a year-long contract for 4 x 15,000t for shipment beginning 4Q 2015. Offers are requested to be submitted on 23 June, and no price indi- cations are currently known. Petrobras\\' most recent ten- der was for 15,000t (for 25 June-5 July delivery) and was awarded in the mid-$80s/t cfr Barra dos Coqueiros.\\nThis demand from Brazil is currently keeping the European market balanced, with Paranapanema also expected to be looking for tonnage in the coming months.\\nChile\\nChilean market remains quiet and balanced-to-long. A few participants in the market are understood to be arranging timeswaps. The Chilean market is slightly long, partially due to problems following the flooding in late March. Also con- tinuing are issues at Antofagasta\\'s Antucoya project, which was still in the ramp-up process.\\nCuba\\nMoa sulphur burner operational in 4Q16\\nConstruction of the second sulphuric acid plant at Sher-\\nritt\\'s Moa facility is going smoothly and now expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. Moa\\'s second sul- phur burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulphuric acid produc- tion capacity (around 667 t/d of sulphur consumption).\\nOnce the new sulphur burner is operational, Moa will cut back its smelter acid imports, estimated at around 500,000 t/yr, and raise its sulphur consumption, mainly sourced from the west coast of Canada. All sulphur-based acid production will be for captive use.\\nMexico\\nMining giant Grupo Mexico has confirmed that its Buenavista mine is still undergoing expansion work, and will be com- pleted by August. Once this expansion has been completed, the mine is expected to consume around 6,000-7,000 t/ month, all of which will be sourced from the company\\'s La Caridad smelter.\\nCurrently, Grupo Mexico produces around 1mn t/yr at its various operations in Mexico, 60pc of which is sold to the US market, and the remaining 40pc of which is either used captively in Mexico or sold to the Chilean market.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nPCS will close its sulphur-burned sulphuric acid plant at Geismar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was \"most advantageous to the company.\" PCS is closing the facility because of expenses needed to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.\\nThe plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulphur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid, and will now procure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulphuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market partici- pants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.\\nAfrica and Mediterranean\\nMorocco\\nCurrently, OCP in Morocco is continuing to buy spot acid, though there is speculation that cargoes to Jorf Lasfar would slow because of OCP\\'s new fertilizer plants. It is understood that 6,000t has been fixed to load in Nordenham, Germany in end-June, for shipment to Jorf Lasfar, Morocco.\\nAnother cargo is due to be fixed to ship 7,000t from Kris- tiansand in Norway to Jorf Lasfar. The date of this cargo does not appear to be finalised yet. These two cargoes are both understood to have been sold within the current cfr range for North Africa of $50-60/t cfr.\\nSpain\\nAtlantic Copper, a smelter in Huelva, Spain owned by Freeport-McMoRan, will undergo a planned maintenance in September this year. The turnaround will last around two weeks. The shutdown will likely mean the loss of around 50,000t acid from the market.\\nEurope\\nNW Europe\\nIn Northwest Europe this week, talk has continued on third quarter contract negotiations. With the market understood to be balanced, players on both the buy and sell sides agree that a rollover is the most likely outcome. Only sulphur-\\nburned acid producers have spoken of an increase due to the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar causing sulphur prices to rise while acid prices fall. This happened in 2Q but may not happen again in 3Q. The contracts for the third quarter will likely be finalised in the next week or so.\\nElsewhere, producers of smelter acid are understood to be not as tight as early 2Q. While few spot deals have been completed (other than the two small cargoes to OCP listed under Africa/Mediterranean), smelters in Europe are now suggesting that tonnage is available. These producers have stated that they would be willing to sell in the mid-$30s/t fob NW Europe, which is a decrease on the $40+/t fob asking price being quoted earlier in the quarter.\\nAsia\\nJapan/Korea\\nThe market remains balanced in Asia. While deals have been few in recent weeks, small amounts of movement has been seen, indicating that tonnage is available in the Far East.\\nThe exact extent of availability is not clear, though Pan Pa- cific Copper completed a spot sale at the beginning of June. The cargo is 19,000t, going to Southern China. The buyer is thought to be a previous term contract holder. This is under- stood to be the first cargo to sent from PPC to this buyer for over a year. The price is heard to be under $40/t cfr, netting back to around $15-20/t fob Japan/South Korea.\\nTraders and market participants alike have noted that prices in Japan and Korea have remained fairly stable. With demand in India fairly stable at present, and some tonnage available at smelters in the Far East, our price assessment remains at $25-32/t fob Korea/Japan, though some market participants have suggested that it may be closer to the lower end of the range.\\nPPC his thought to have only 10,000t spot tonnage avail- able until the end of the year, and is unlikely to complete any more spot deals until the turnaround at its Saganoseki smelter is completed. In October or November, the smelter will be put into turnaround, which will last approximately 40 days. The smelter produces around 120,000 t/month. During this time, Sumitomo\\'s Niihama smelter will also undergo a turnaround for 20 days. Niihama\\'s monthly production is also around 120,000t, and these two temporary shutdowns will likely keep the acid market in Asia balanced for the remain- der of 2015.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nFreight rates from South Korea/Japan to east coast India have increased from $30-35/t to $34-38/t.\\nIndia\\nIndian demand is understood to be stable at present. As most major consumers have finished their 2Q turnarounds, the need for acid is not as strong. This year\\'s monsoon is understood to be better than originally forecasted, but still not as strong as many had hoped for.\\nPPL is understood to have completed a deal via a trader for Far East smelter acid. The company has purchased a cargo of 19,000t for first half of August arrival. The deal is under- stood to have been completed in the mid-$50s/t cfr east coast India. This is a distressed cargo and will not be used to assess the current price ranges in Asia.\\nChina\\nIn China, a turnaround is understood to be coming to an end at the Yanggu Xiangguang smelter. The smelter, which serves the domestic market, produces around 1.5mn t/yr sulphuric acid, and was down for around two weeks. This resulted in the loss of 50,000-60,000t acid from the domestic market, and is understood to have increased the domestic price in Shandong province. Currently, the range for the region is believed to be RMB 370-400/t exw.\\nJiangxi Copper will reportedly undergo a maintenance at one of its smelter complexes in late June or July. It is unclear which smelter is being put into turnaround, but it is understood that it serves the Yangtze River area, and that it will affect sulphuric acid supply in the area.\\nImport and Export data - Asia\\n\\x84\\x84In the period January-March 2015, exports of acid from Belgium were 60pc higher than they had been the previous January-March period. The country shipped 171,327t in the first three months of this year, up from the 107,316t posted in the same timeframe last year.\\n\\x84\\x84This is mainly due to a 40pc increase in the amount of acid Belgium sent to the Netherlands in this timeframe. Bel- gium shipped 52,636t to the Netherlands in January-March, up from 37,551t the previous year.\\nSource: Eurostat, copyright GTIS, 2015\\n\\x84\\x84Shipments of German acid from January-March 2015 totalled 68,839t, which is only a 1pc decrease on shipments during the same period last year.\\n\\x84\\x84Shipments to Poland, Netherlands and the Czech Re- public all fell during this timeframe compared to last year, however an increase in tonnage sent to Belgium - Germany\\'s largest offtaker of acid - helped make up for the deficit.\\nSource: Eurostat, copyright GTIS, 2015\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphuric Acid\\n\\x84\\x84Sweden posted a 6pc increase in exports for January- March 2015.

Prices moved in line with domestic markets, which sank lower as producers raced to reduce inventory levels ahead of the anticipated two week lull. Sulphur prices remain in freefall, with scant buying on the horizon to offer support.\\nIndian cfr values were weighed on this week by offers reported in the mid-to-high $20s/t. High fertilizer stocks persist and buyers are eyeing cheaper priced acid. Offers for April deliveries into India were reported in the mid-to- high $20s/t, and possible spot trade added weight to already depressed cfr values.\\n* Indicative price/No recent business\\nSouth Korea/Japan fob prices tracked Indian cfr values lower this week, to be reported at a $0/t midpoint.

Nickel prices declined the most of all base metals over the course of last year, down to below $9,000/t, feeding expectations that producers would announce large output cuts because as estimates that at those price levels more than a half of global producers were unproﬁtable.\\n\\uf06eBut these estimates were based on much higher oil prices and a different picture in terms of currencies. As oil prices dropped to around $30/bbl so did key production costs such as transport and electricity. Similarly, the weakening of commodity currencies like the ruble, rand and the Austra- lian dollar has worked in favour of producers and helped them to cut costs rather than output.\\n\\uf06eAlthough there has been a number of mine and smelter closures over the last 12 months these were mainly smaller and less proﬁtable operations. Recent examples include Panoramic Resources which is in the process of placing its\\nSavanah mine in Western Australia on care and maintenance and Glencore which is considering shutting down its Murrin Murrin mine in Western Australia. But a number of the lat- est production decisions were not based on simple eco- nomic maths but on labour and social issues. For instance, instead of closing down its Manitoba smelting and reﬁning in 2015 as initially planned, Brazilian miner Vale decided to extended the operations there until 2018.\\n\\uf06eSimilarly, the Finnish state decided to resurrect the bankrupt Talvivaara Sotkamo nickel mine and restart pro- duction in order to preserve jobs and have access to nickel.\\nThe most proﬁtable producers are keeping their production levels steady, notably the world’s two largest nickel makers,\\nRussia’s Norilsk Nickel and Brazil’s Vale.\\n\\uf06eAs long as the expected mine and smelter closures are not materialising there is not likely to be a shortage of the metal on the global market – London Metal Exchange ware- house stocks are still at around 450,000t - and there is little incentive for nickel prices to move higher.\\nFollow us on Twitter @ArgusFMB\\nfor market insights from our editors.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\n\\x84\\x84Global demand is not likely to change this picture. All the economic signals from China point to lower usage in the year ahead, particularly from the infrastructure and transport sectors, the two main end users of the metal. De- mand elsewhere like the US and other emerging markets is increasing but at a fairly slow pace while demand in Europe and Japan remains stagnant. While this persists nickel pric- es are likely to remain in a range, capped on the one hand by excess supply and supported on the other by production costs which will not allow for a much larger price decline.\\nSupply - Sulphur\\n\\x84\\x84Reductions in Middle East monthly prices were widely anticipated, yet the decrease of $17/t for the Official Selling Price (OSP) by UAE’s Adnoc and the $30/t cut by Tasweeq in its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) shocked the market for different reasons. While both producers acknowledged the decline in demand resulted from a slowing phosphates mar- ket, some considered the OSP too high, though it is thought to reflect Adnoc’s comfortable position. Tasweeq’s decision baffled some as it is over $10/t lower than the most recent spot sale in the Middle East for 2H February loading, con- cluded at around $100/t fob.\\nSulphuric acid this week\\n\\x84\\x84The price gap between the three monthly lifting prices is now wide at $26/t - a clear reflection of a weakening mar- ket. There is a lack of demand for sulphur, which has led to prices falling day by day in some regions. In the Mediter- ranean, one trader said “you have a price one day, it’s gone the next.”\\n\\x84\\x84The Chinese New Year holiday beginning later this week marks the start of two weeks of negligible demand in the 11.9mn t import market. The latest granular deals took place between the $90s/t and low-$100s/t cfr China as traders begin to liquidate, with spot crushed lump business concluded in the mid-$80s/t cfr. Molten sulphur trades have also moved down to the $80s/t cfr.\\nDemand - Leaching and Industrial\\n\\x84\\x84Copper prices climbed to $4,605.50/t on 2 February, up $98/t on the week, but slipped back down to $4,578.50/t by the close. While prices have ticked up on the whole, market sentiment has been gloomy as Chinese spot prices continue to sit at multi-year lows on oversupply economic slowdown. Three-month futures ticked up in a similar fashion to cash prices, with a high of $4,601/t reached on 2 February, but prices slipped down to $4,580.50 on 3 February.\\nChina– A sale on an ex-Fancheng basis for prompt delivery to Paradeep, India was reported this week.

Latin American prices have contin- ued to fall (although by much less this week) as traders sell remaining lots from January vessels. India is full of product and southeast Asian demand is lacklustre.\\n\\x84\\x84With DAP/MAP prices plummeting in Latin America, it came as little surprise that a supply side response would ensue. Mosaic has taken the lead by announcing it will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. Assuming these cuts are fully realised, they will represent 14pc of Mosaic\\'s quar- terly finished phosphate production capacity. The likely re- sponse will be a reaction in the domestic price, but Mosaic faces a delicate balancing act. On the one hand it wants to shore up the price for phosphates, but on the other it wants to protect domestic market share. Cutting production runs the risk of encouraging more DAP/MAP imports from Russia and Morocco. Mosaic will thus doubtless be hoping other producers follow suit. But the question is who will follow Mosaic\\'s lead? The US is not the global phosphates super- power it once was, its mantle taken by Morocco and China, so this announcement in itself will not be enough to balance the market.\\n\\x84\\x84Fundamentally there is no demand of note anywhere in the world. This situation will continue for at least three weeks, and possibly longer until more Latin American de- mand emerges, the US domestic season gets underway and we have a better idea of how the Chinese domestic market is shaping up. In the meantime, producers will hope that the supply side curtailments do the trick.\\nSouth America\\nBrazil\\nBrazilian cfr prices narrowed this week to be assessed in the $42-48/t cfr range, after finding support from fresh trade and reportedly tighter supply.\\nSome market participants pegged value at the upper end of the range, while recent trade out of Ilo, Peru confirmed the low end.\\nSome market participants attributed a firming in sentiment to increased spot appetite in Argentina, which has absorbed\\nadditional European material.

But the company says its investments in the project are already benefiting residents, farmers and ranchers to the tune of about $28mn.\\nThe project, with an expected mine life of 20 years, will take around two years to build before moving into produc- tion, allowing time for copper prices to recover after the recent sharp declines in copper prices, company executives say. The project would use solvent-extraction electro-win- ning (SX-EW) technology, which will consume around 700,000 t/yr of sulphuric acid.\\nCopper spot prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) have fallen by nearly 20pc to $4,578/t from $5,695/t on 3 February in 2015, as demand for commodities around the world has waned as a result of China\\'s economic slowdown.\\nIn the first nine months of 2015 Southern Copper, part of Mexico-based Grupo Mexico, produced 536,593t of copper and 17,354t of molybdenum from mines in Mexico and Peru.\\nMexico\\nPemex acquires Mexican phosphate producer Fertinal\\nMexican phosphate producer Fertinal confirmed that it has been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes, a subsidiary of the state-owned company.\\n\"Today is time for a change of control, we confirm that Fertinal has officially been acquired by Pemex Fertilizantes,\" Fertinal said in a letter to stakeholders and customers. \"This acquisition will bring new opportunities for Fertinal due to the vertical integration of this Group in the chain production of gas–ammonia–fertilizer; this will allow Grupo Fertinal to become a low cost producer and a stronger competitor.\"\\nThe acquisition has been made official after Pemex reached an agreement to take over Fertinal in December.\\nFertinal, Mexico\\'s lone phosphate producer, had endured cash flow issues over the past two years because of a series of operational setbacks, combined with falling global phos- phate prices. The company\\'s phosphate rock mine in Baja California Sur, Mexico, was impacted by a hurricane and a fire in late 2014, which decreased production.\\nFertinal sale may impact sulphur and sulphuric acid pro- curement\\nMexican fertilizer producer Fertinal is a consumer of sulphur and sulphuric acid for the production of phosphate fertil- izers. The firm intends to build \"business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers\", according to a recent statement, indicating its procurement methods may not change substantially in the near term.\\nThe firm imported around 445,000t of sulphur, and 180,000- 185,000t of sulphuric acid via the port of Lazaro Cardenas last year. Most of its sulphur and sulphuric acid procurement in the past has been conducted via traders, on a spot basis.\\nSulphur is produced locally in Mexico from natural gas processing and oil refining, and all refineries in Mexico are owned by Pemex. At present, the only outlets for Pemex\\'s sulphur production are the domestic market, or the move- ment of molten sulphur by vessel to the US for two key fertilizer producers: Mosaic and PotashCorp.\\nLogistical constraints have prevented Fertinal from receiv- ing significant quantities of sulphur from Pemex in the past. And while it makes sense for Fertinal to be self-sufficient with Pemex\\'s sulphur in the future, investments are needed to improve transportation to and from the Fertinal units and within Mexico.\\nIf this happens, domestic trade flow may change and it may have a knock-on effect on the utilisation of Mexico\\'s first sul- phur forming capacity, which is expected to come on stream in the first half of 2016, with capacity of 360,000t/yr.\\nThe forming unit is located at Coatzacoalcos in south Mexico on the Atlantic coast and is also owned by Pemex. Its start up should allow sulphur production unconsumed by the local market to move offshore. But its utilisation is subject to change, depending on Fertinal\\'s future sulphur procurement strategy.\\nAs for sulphuric acid, Fertinal produces sulphur-based acid and augments its requirements with imports. The cargoes typically come from the Far East, delivered via tankers and combo vessels, which are capable of transporting acid from Japan/South Korea to Latin America and copper concentrate on return voyages.\\nLogistical disadvantages again have so far made it cheaper for Fertinal to import acid, rather than receive domestic product via tanker trucks.\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphuric Acid\\nWith the acquisition, it remains to be seen if a partnership is could be established with local smelter acid producer South- ern Copper/Grupo Mexico. The company operates two mines that both produce smelter acid in Mexico — La Caridad in Nacozari and Buenavista in Cananea, both located in Sonora.\\nAnother potential partnership could be with El Boleo, in Baja California Sur state in southern Mexico, a copper producer that was expected to export an estimated 200,000t of sulphur-based sulphuric acid via the port of Santa Rosalia last year. But given Mexico exported 225,000t and 140,000t of sulphuric acid to Chile and Brazil in January-October 2015, respectively, last year’s export figure appears likely to significantly surpass original estimates\\nMeanwhile, Fertinal is estimated to be covered with sulphur and sulphuric acid until around March.\\nNorth America\\nUS\\nThe North American market remained flat this week, with dampened demand keeping prices relatively static in the $39-45/t cfr range.\\nIn the US, the market remains well supplied by contractual volumes and domestic oversupply. Both factors continue to limit the need for import tonnage.\\nBearish sentiment was augmented this week by news the leading US fertilizer producer Mosaic will cut phosphate production by up to 400,000t, with rotating plant shutdowns in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction is unlikely to impact US vessel import prices, given the producer is mostly self-sufficient for its acid needs.\\nAfrica and Mediterranean\\nMorocco\\nNorth African cfr prices were assessed flat at $15-25/t cfr week-on-week, following the conclusion of a deal in the middle of that range last week.\\nQuestions over Moroccan phosphates producer OCP’s sulph- uric acid consumption levels were again raised, following the inauguration of the firm’s Africa Fertilizer complex earlier this week.\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nIndia: sulphuric acid discharge/arrivals in Jan-Feb 2016\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nIdeas surrounding the producer’s sulphuric acid demand remain in flux, amid the ongoing backdrop of a weakening phosphates market.\\nOCP’s Africa Fertilizer Complex inaugurated\\nAfrica Fertilizer Complex, part of OCP’s Jorf Lasfar phos- phate-production facility in Morocco was inaugurated on 1 February.\\nThe plant will solely supply fertilizers to African markets.

NP sales fell to nil from 120,300t in 2014.\\nAmmonia-based fertilizer sales fell by 82.2pc to 6,100t; phosphoric acid sales fell by 20.3pc to 41,100t, while sulph-\\nuric acid sales dropped by 81.8pc to 19,600t.\\nOnly phosphate-based fertilizer showed growth — DAP/MAP and NPK sales rose by 11.6pc and 11.8pc to 2.6mn t and 1.9mn t, respectively, during the period. Overall fertilizer sales for the year rose by 9pc to 6.6mn t.\\n“2015 was another challenging year in terms of the mac- roeconomic environment. With prices for all commodities declining, it comes as no surprise that fertilizer prices followed the same trend,” PhosAgro chief executive Andrey Guryev said.\\nPhosAgro’s annual sales to Europe grew by 30pc to 1.25mn t, while sales to India rose to 700,000t. Latin American market performance was weaker as a result of low soybean prices and economic challenges in the region, the company said.\\nOn the production side, PhosAgro produced 11.7pc more DAP/MAP at 2.6mn t. NPKs production in 2015 rose by 11.4pc to 1.9mn t. Urea production was up by 1.3pc to 978,100t; and SOP and sulphuric acid production gained 23.6pc and 5.6pc to 36,700t and 4.7mn t, respectively.\\n“Throughout 2015, PhosAgro continued to invest in the mod- ernisation of its production facilities and to implement other cost-cutting initiatives… we managed to increase our produc- tion of fertilizers by 10pc year on year, and by the end of 2015 our annual fertilizer production capacity reached 7mn t,” Guryev said.\\nNyrstar zinc, sulphuric acid output rises in 2015\\nBelgian zinc and minor metals producer Nyrstar\\'s output of sulphuric acid in 2015 increased by 1pc year on year to 1.45mn t across its global portfolio, while zinc production climbed by 2pc to 1.1mn t.\\nNyrstar realised an average global price of $39/t for acid in the second half of 2015, down by 13pc from the first half. Lower prices were driven by “weakening global sulphur prices”, a weaker euro against the US dollar and indications of a weakening in the world economy during the second half of 2015, the company said.\\nGermany-based Aurubis, Europe\\'s largest copper smelter, attributed similar weak fundamentals to an \"unfavourable\" situation for sulphuric acid prices.\\nNyrstar had stable euro prices of sulphuric acid within northwest European markets, but stability was “negatively\\nLicensed to: Fadila El Hillali, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB Sulphuric Acid\\nimpacted by the weakening of the euro against the US dol- lar”, the firm said.\\nArgus assessed smelter acid contract prices within northwest Europe at €53-70/t ($59-78/t) cfr in the second half of 2015, flat compared with the first half of the year.\\nNyrstar\\'s zinc production at Auby, France, was down by 1pc on the year at 169,000t. Output from Balen, Belgium, fell by 1pc to 260,000t. Budel in the Netherlands produced 291,000t, flat compared with 2014. Production at the firm’s Clarksville plant in the US increased by 13pc to 124,000t. Its Hobart, Australia, operations produced 271,000t, up by 8pc. The average achieved zinc price throughout 2015 was $1,928/t, down by 11pc from 2014.\\nNyrstar attributed the increase in production across the year to fewer planned maintenance shutdowns as well as the improved availability and utilisation of roasting, leaching and cell-house processes. But a number of scheduled mainte- nance shutdowns at smelters this year may negatively impact both zinc and sulphuric acid output.\\nNyrstar completed all major engineering work at its Port Pirie smelter redevelopment in Australia, paving the way for a full ramp-up to commence in the second half of the year, the company said.\\nIt remains unclear what level sulphuric acid production will be at following the ramp-up, but a possible surplus of around 200,000t may need to be exported from Adelaide to balance the market, market participants said.\\nIncreased output from Port Pirie could be absorbed in the Australian market if the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter has less supply. But the smelter, which provides sulphuric acid to Australian fertilizer and chemical company Incitec Pivot\\'s Phosphate Hill plant, had its life span extended last Novem- ber to the end of 2022 from the end of this year.\\nNyrstar\\'s metals segment posted 2015 earnings before inter- est, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of €336mn, an increase of €96mn from 2014.\\nAnnouncement\\nThe holiday calendar showing which Argus reports are not published on which days is now available online http://www.argusmedia.com/Methodology-and- Reference/Publishing-Schedule\\nIssue 16-05 | Thursday 4 February 2016\\nImport and Export data - Mediterranean\\nTurkey\\nTurkey imported just under 55,000t of sulphuric acid In November 2015, a drop of 4pc year-on-year.\\nBulgaria supplied 99pc of Turkey’s import requirements for November, with the remaining 500t coming from Italy and Germany.\\nTurkey imported just over 523,000t of acid in the first 11 months of last year, an increase of 13pc on 2014.\\nBulgaria continues to be the country’s biggest supplier, ship- ping around 511,000t to the country, an increase of 19pc on the year.

More specifically, the country’s smelter gas-based sulfuric acid output increased by nearly 20% y/y, accounting for more than 30% of the total output; and the country’s sulfur-based sulfuric acid output increased by only 1.9% y/y.\\nChina’s sulfuric acid production is more concentrated. In 2014, the country’s top ten sulfuric acid makers produced\\n30.32million tons of sulfuric acid, accounting for 32.8% of the country’s total, 1.7 percentage points higher than the previous year.\\nIn the first four months of this year, China produced 29.45 million tons of sulfuric acid, up 6.7% y/y; and imported 3.61 million tons of sulfur, down 2% y/y.\\nAccording to QI Yan, director of China Sulfuric Acid Industry Association, 60.9% of China’s 2014 consumption of sulfuric acid was for fertilizer production; 86.3% of the country’s 2014 sulfuric acid consumption for fertilizer production (or 52.5% of the country’s 2014 total consumption of sulfuric acid) was for phosphate fertilizer production; and 92.8% of China’s 2014 consumption of sulfuric acid for phosphate fertilizer production was for high concentrated phosphate fertilizers.\\nIn 2014, the country’s average price of sulfuric acid increased by RMB 70/t y/y. The prices of sulfuric acid average RMB 300/t in domestic markets.\\nQI Yan said at the conference that China’s sulfuric acid capacity will increase slowly in the coming years. Efforts will be made to control the construction of new plants, extend product chains, develop cyclic economy, and enhance the industry’s capabilities in engineering and design.\\n○Operation of China’s Coal Industry from January to May\\nIn the first five months of this year, China produced 1.46 billion tons of coal, down 93.21 million tons or 6% y/y; and\\n1.32billion tons of coal was sold around the country, down 127 million tons or 8.8% y/y, according to DONG Yueying of China Coal Delivery and Marketing Industry Association.\\nFrom January to May, 859 million tons of coal was rail delivered around the country, down 103 million tons or 10.6% y/y. In May alone, 165 million tons of coal was rail delivered around the country, down 25.09 million tons or 13.2% y/y. The country’s monthly rail delivery volume of coal has kept declining for nine consecutive months.\\nThis year, the prices of coal have been declining in domestic markets. China Coal Price Index was 131.2 points on June 12, down 10.6% y/y. The prices of power coal at Qinhuangdao Port were RMB 410-420/t on June 17, the lowest in nearly ten years. In early June, the average price of coking coal was about 30% lower y/y.\\nAs of the end of May, the country’s total coal inventory has remained at more than 300 million tons for 41 consecutive months. At the end of May, the coal mining enterprises held a combined coal inventory of 106 million, up 7.2% y/y.\\nThe country’s Jan.-May consumption of coal is estimated at around 1.57 billion tons, down 5% y/y. More specifically, 790 million tons was for electric power generation, down 6.3% y/y; 270 million tons was for steel industry, down 2.1% y/y; 190 million tons was for construction materials, down 8.5% y/y; and 1 million tons was for chemical production, up 9.7% y/y.\\nDuring the eight years until end-2014, China’s coal mining capacity grew by 3 billion tpy. For some large coal mining firms it is necessary to keep up a high output of coal.\\nOn the other hand, Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia AR, China Shenhua and China Coal and some other large coal producers have cut their coal output. China’s coal output is projected to decrease this year by 5%.\\n○2015 China Nitrogen and Methanol Conference, July 16-18, Erdos\\nChina Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association (CNFA) will host its “2015 China Nitrogen and Methanol Conference” on July 16-18 in Erdos City of Inner Mongolia AR.\\nSponsors of the conference include China Coal Erdos Energy and Chemical Ltd and Inner Mongolia Boyuan Holding Group Ltd.\\nCNFA has posted a list of speakers, including:\\n1 LI Yongwu, head of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation;\\n2 GU Zongqin, head of China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association;\\n3 BGL gasifiers, by China Coal Erdos Energy and Chemical Ltd;\\n4 Cyclic development based on natural soda and coal resources, by Inner Mongolia Boyuan Holding Group Ltd;\\n5 Advanced technologies leading to high energy efficiency, by Shandong Hualu Hengsheng Chemical Ltd;\\n6 Shanxi Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group’s competitiveness in nitrogen fertilizer production;\\n7 Operation of Shanxi Yangquan Coal affiliate Cangzhou Zhengyuan Chemical’s 0.6 million tpy ammonia plant;\\n8 Operation of JAMG Anhui Haoyuan Chemical’s 0.2 million tpy ammonia (methanol) plant;\\n9 CNPC Ningxia’s energy-saving technical renovation of a\\nPage 2\\nlarge natural gas-based ammonia plant;\\n10 Performance of China’s ammonia and methanol plants employing advanced coal gasification technologies, by China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association;\\n11 HT-L coal gasification process and its application;\\n12 Development of urea products at home and abroad, by the CNFA;\\n13 China Coal Erdos Energy and Chemical Ltd’s urea granulation unit, and the quality of its urea product.\\n○China’s Top Ten Phosphate Fertilizer Makers for 2014\\nChina Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association reported that last year China produced 17.088 million tons of phosphate fertilizer (P2O5), of which 9.422 million tons was produced by the following ten enterprises, accounting for 55.1% of the total: 1) Yuntianhua, 2.677 million tons; 2) Guizhou Kailin, 1.467 million tons; 3) Guizhou Wengfu, 1.14 million tons; 4) Hubei New Yangfeng,\\n0.765 million tons; 5) Hubei Yihua, 0.705 million tons; 6) Tonghua Group, 0.64 million tons; 7) Yunnan Xiangfeng, 0.592 million tons; 8) Hubei Xiangyun, 0.545 million tons; 9) JAMG Hubei Sanning, 0.489 million tons; and 10) Sinochem Fuling, 0.404 million tons.\\n○Rail Freight Rates Lowered for Cotton and Fertilizer\\nDelivered from Xinjiang AR\\nRail freight rates for some key products delivered from Xinjiang AR to other areas had been lowered, starting on June 12.\\nMore specifically, for cotton, the rail freight rate was lowered by 15% from RMB 0.161/t per kilometer to RMB 0.137/t per kilometer. That means, for example, a RMB 96 reduction for delivering one ton of cotton 4,000 kilometers. Delivery of a ton of fertilizer 4,000 kilometers from Xinjiang would be reduced by RMB 50/t.\\nMarket\\nHighlights this week\\n\\uf06eUrea market prices down a bit\\n\\uf06eAmmonium sulfate markets stable\\n\\uf06eMAP markets still steady\\n\\uf06ePhosphate rock markets stable\\n\\uf06eSOP markets still weak\\n\\uf06eExchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2\\nUrea\\nChina’s prill urea output was 808kt during the third week of June, up significantly by 6.18% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.01%, reaching 167.9kt. According to statistics of 24 June, daily urea output was 188.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 73.43%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 80.66%, while gas-based producers’ average is 56.05%.\\nDomestic urea markets weakened a bit; some areas’ urea prices slid since the end of last week. Although India held urea tenders, the closing prices were too low. The representative price was $307/t, FOB China – very disappointing to those involved in export. Meanwhile, the domestic sales situation is also face unfavorable. The frequency of new signed orders has been decreasing quickly.\\nIn North China, Shanxi Province urea prices were reduced a bit; most urea makers have few new orders, and low sales\\nPage 3\\nvolumes have become a worry. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $268-271/t. East China’s urea markets remain stable, but urea prices there also began to drop slightly. The local industrial demand in Shandong Province is slack; and seaport urea prices lack support. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $279-282/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, urea markets continued to weaken on the whole; new orders from local customers are rare. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $274-281/t.\\nAccording to data from China Customs, China exported 0.81 million tons of urea in May, up 50% year to year; and 6.09 million tons in Jan-May, up 59.7% year to year.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets kept steady; sales were still weak. Mining rates are not high; the nation’s collective coal inventory stayed low. The wait-and-see atmosphere is predominant. North China coal markets were still steady overall, but the local coal producers did not feel optimistic about sales. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for\\n$123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week.\\nIn Central China, Henan Province anthracite markets were still steady overall; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices stayed stable: $151/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $152/t in Yongcheng, also like last week. Southwest China’s anthracite markets remained weak; mining rates were not high. The local market lacks support for a quick rebound. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $123/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate markets adjusted slightly this week; the ammonium sulfate prices fluctuated a little in some areas. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 68.8% average operating rate, up 0.4% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 68% on average, down significantly 5% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $90-100/t in Shanxi Province, $102-108/t in Hebei Province, $110-119/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.\\nOn 23 June, Hebei Qianan Jiujiang tendered 1,200 tons of ammonium sulfate, selling at $116/t, up $2/t from last week. On the same day, Hebei Handan Steel auctioned 1,100 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet, selling at $102/t, up $3/t from last week. On 25 June, Hebei Huafeng held an ammonium sulfate tender; the final transaction price was $107/t, the same as last week. On 26 June, Shanxi Coking auctioned 480 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the closing price was $97/t.\\nPhosphate & NPK\\n\\uf075Production\\nTypical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 80% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; its operating rate declined a bit. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets remained stable overall; domestic sales remained slack as is usual for this time of year. Autumn fertilizer application shows no sign of starting. The main DAP producers mainly worked on export orders, and most have existing orders that could last to the middle of July.\\nCentral China DAP markets remained stable overall; export was still the focus for the DAP makers there. Most have orders that can last to the middle of July. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hubei Province stayed at $435/t for DAP with 64% content, and delivered prices for North and East\\nChina destinations are $460-468/t for DAP with 64% content, the same as last week. Southwest China’s DAP makers maintained stable prices. Mainstream ex-factory prices there were around $427/t for DAP with 64% content; FOB prices for Southeast Asia destinations are $465/t for DAP with 64% content.\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 355,000 tons, up 20,000 tons from last week; of that, 130,000 tons\\nPage 4\\nis in Zhanjiang Port, 90,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 15,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 60,000 tons in Beihai Port, 45,000 tons in Nanjing Port and 15,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets remained steady on the whole; demand increased due to NPK companies starting to produce. The main MAP makers have plenty of orders in hand, and some have enough to last one month. Granular MAP products are still sent to seaports to fulfill export orders.\\nIn Central China, Hubei Province’s MAP market remained stable; most MAP producers had plenty of orders in hand, which could last one month. MAP spot supply is tight. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $347/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $379/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nSouthwest China MAP makers mainly produced granular MAP products for export markets; the operating rates of powder MAP units were not high. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $331-339/t for powder MAP with 55% content, $339-347/t for granular MAP with 55% content and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nEast China’s MAP prices stayed stable; demand is normal.

Granular output was down slightly by 1.59%, reaching 165.2kt. According to statistics of 1 July, daily urea output was 185.4kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 72.18%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 79.67%, while gas-based producers’ average is 54.17%.\\n\\uf075Domestic market\\nDomestic urea prices continued to slide in many areas; distributors remained cautious. The main urea inventories\\nare stable, and sales go on normally.\\nIn North China, Hebei Province urea markets were slack overall, and prices were reduced a bit. Some local urea makers sent product to Northeast China. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hebei are $271-274/t. East China’s urea markets started to weaken; the local agricultural demand in Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces is sluggish. Affected by frequent rainfall, the fertilizer application period has been postponed. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $277-282/t.

Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady. Most DAP makers are working on export orders, and those orders can last to the end of July, so they feel no sales pressure.\\nCentral China DAP markets were steady, with producers operating at around 70% and keeping comfortable inventory levels. Export was still the focus. Most producers have orders that can last to the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hubei Province stayed at $435/t for DAP with 64% content, and delivered prices for North and East China destinations are $460-468/t for DAP with 64% content, the same as last week. Southwest China’s DAP makers also attended to export markets. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465/t for Indian destinations, $472-473/t for Southeast Asian destinations, and $480/t for destinations in Pakistan.\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 355,000 tons, the same as last week; of that, 130,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 90,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 15,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 60,000 tons in Beihai Port, 45,000 tons in Nanjing Port and 15,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets were still stable overall; the main MAP makers have plenty of orders in hand, and some have enough to keep them busy till the end of this month. Some demand is evident, and inventory levels are not worrisome.\\nPage 4\\nIn Central China, Hubei Province’s MAP spot markets were in short supply; granular MAP products were mainly sent to export markets. Prices stayed stable on the whole. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $347/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $371-379/t for powder MAP with 60% content, almost the same as last week.\\nSouthwest China MAP makers continued to maintain low operating rates for powder MAP units, and some of them switched over to granular MAP products. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $331-339/t for powder MAP with 55% content, $339-347/t for granular MAP with 55% content and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nEast China’s MAP prices kept steady because of stable demand; there were plenty of orders.

Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphate\\nGlobal phosphate markets have the mixed directions at early July after long period stable. USA export values have slipped down to low $470s/t fob Tampa, but there is the continued shipments of MAP to Latin America, and DAP to India. For US local market, the NOLA DAP price continues firm at last level of $430/short ton barges. Russia exporters begin to quote a bit lower prices, mainly for the bigger MAP volumes to Brazil, at the low $470s/t fob Baltic. For other markets such as Europe, the DAP price also is down a small amount, but still above the level $500/t fob North Africa. Still there is no production of the DAP in Tunisia. For this reason, there is strong business for Morocco in Turkey market. For Asia, India prices are in minor decline for India in high $470s/t cfr. Pakistan is not in market after big purchasing in June.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur markets are on the upswing because international sulfur prices rose a bit. In some regions, refineries overhauled or limited production to maintain low sulfur inventories. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $174-189/t in Northeast China, $195-210/t in North China, $190-202/t in East China, $182-293/t in South China and $195-206/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur products in the ports are concentrated in the hands of a few prominent traders; they are optimistic about the sulfur market and are in no rush to sell their goods. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 940,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 3,000 tons from last week, with 330,000 tons in Nantong Port, 70,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 140,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 70,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 38,000 tons in Beihai Port and 240,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were stable on the whole; sales in the main areas were disappointing, but prices stayed unchanged. Guizhou Province phosphate rock markets adjusted slightly. Some rock mines remained idle due to the previous rainfall. Resuming production will depend on the weather. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock market prices fluctuated little; mainstream rock prices are $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock\\nPage 5\\nmarkets were stable; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content. In Central China, Hubei Province producers maintained low mining rates. Rock prices are unchanged: $65-77/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.\\n(15-15-15). In Central China, Henan Province NPK markets were in a short off season; NPK makers overhauled for 1-2 weeks. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).\\n\\uf075NPK\\nDomestic NPK – Domestic NPK makers have announced their autumn fertilizer policies and prices gradually.

Also Vietnam imports are going on, but prices stay flat at $330/t cfr. In the West markets, the granular MOP trade goes slow. In Brazil now, the price of imported granular MOP re-stabilizes in the area of mid $320s/t cfr. So far the intention for supplier increase is proposed but not achieved after market competition\\ncontinues. In the USA, an important price instance is reached after domestic pre-season program prices are announced at $355pst fob. The NOLA market is flat in range $315-320/short ton fob barge. For Europe, the standard MOP are in range €260-275/t cfr, and granular MOP in range €295-300/t cfr according to the cargo size.

The combined financial result of China’s top 90 coal firms was a net loss for the first five months of this year.\\nMany coal mining firms in 20 provinces around the country have cut employees’ pay, in some cases by as much as 30%. A survey shows that 40 of the 85 coal firms investigated did not pay their employees at the usual time. That is, they postponed the pay.\\nChina’s annual coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.5 billion by 2020 and to reach about 4.8 billion tons by 2030.\\n○China’s Methanol Capacity and Production\\nChina’s methanol capacity is estimated at about 68 million tpy. It is projected to grow by 6.57 million tpy this year.\\nLast year, China’s methanol output increased by 26%, reaching 45 million tpy. In the first five months of this year, China produced 15.77 million tons of methanol, up 10.93% y/y, with Northwest China producing 28%, North China 24%, and East China 22%.\\nChina’s natural gas-based methanol output last year was about 6 million tons.\\n○Methanol Consumption by Olefin Producers to\\nIncrease\\nChina’s methanol-based olefin capacity reached 6.3 million tpy at the end of 2014, when 28% of China’s methanol consumption was for the manufacture of olefin accounted.\\nIn the first four months of this year, China’s methanol-based olefin capacity increased by 1.19 million tpy.\\nEighteen methanol-based olefin plants are now in operation around the country, with a combined 7.49 million tpy capacity, demanding about 22.47 million tpy of methanol,\\n13.42million tpy of which is supplied by the olefin makers’ own methanol plants, and the remaining 9.05 million tpy is purchased in the open market.\\nIn the second half of this year, the following olefin plants will be put into operation, none of which are integrated with methanol plants:\\n1 Shanxi Yangquan Coal Hengtong Chemical, 0.3 million tpy;\\n2 Shaanxi Shenmu, 0.6 million tpy;\\n3 China Coal Mengda, 0.6 million tpy;\\n4 Changzhou Fude, 0.33 million tpy.\\n○China HydroElectric (Laos) Potash Ltd’s Potash\\nProduction\\nChina HydroElectric (Laos) Potash Ltd produced 31,000 tons of MOP (K2O 62.2%) in the last quarter of 2014.

Granular output was down slightly by 1.29%, reaching 163.1kt. According to statistics of 8 July, daily urea output was 179.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 69.92%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 77.19%, while gas-based producers’ average is 52.6%.\\n\\uf075Domestic market\\nDomestic urea markets remain depressed; prices dropped further by $3-8/t. New domestic orders are too few to support business as usual; market demand has decreased to some extent. The downward trend has made producers very anxious about sales, and some have started to consider shifting their efforts toward the export market.\\nIn North China, Shanxi Province’s urea market prices followed the downward trend; the local urea makers mainly sent product to fulfill export orders, as domestic demand was limited. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $261-263/t. Overall, East China’s urea markets were stable; the seasonal agricultural demand in Shandong Province has started slowly, while the industrial demand remained sluggish. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $268-270/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, urea markets stayed stable; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $282-287/t.\\nUrea inventories in the main seaports amount to 614,000 tons, up 19,000 tons from last week; of that, 300,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 150,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 35,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 34,000 tons in Laizhou Port and 20,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets were stable on the whole; the main coal companies kept their coal prices unchanged.\\nPage 3\\nDespite slack sales, price adjustments were discouraged by three factors – high coal inventories, weak demand and depressed coal markets. North China coal markets were normal, with prices unchanged. The main local coal producers will not adjust prices in the short term. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central China, Henan Province anthracite markets kept steady; market demand was still weak. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices stayed stable: $151/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $152/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite market prices remained unchanged; local coal inventories were high. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $123/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate markets kept steady overall; prices rose a bit in some regions. Given the usual seasonal variations, the current level of market demand in East China is sufficient to support the market to keep developing steadily. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 68.5% average operating rate, down 0.2% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 78% on average, up significantly 10% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-102/t in Shanxi Province, $103-113/t in Hebei Province, $113-119/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.\\nOn 3 July, Hebei Qianan Jiujiang held a 600-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the selling price was $121/t, up $5/t from last week. Three days later, Hebei Handan Steel auctioned 1,100 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the closing price was $109/t. On 9 July, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $113/t, the same as last week.\\nThe main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 70,000 tons, down 40,000 tons from last week, with 20,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 10,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 40,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.\\nPhosphate & NPK\\n\\uf075Production\\nTypical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets remained steady trend. Some DAP distributors in China began to enquire about prices; however, high DAP prices dampened purchase enthusiasm. The main DAP makers kept working on their export orders; some even have enough orders to last till the middle of August. Mainstream FOB prices are $465-473/t.\\nCentral China DAP markets kept steady, with producers operating at around 70% and keeping comfortable inventory levels. Export orders were adequate; most producers have orders in hand that can last to the end of this month, or even to the middle of August. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Hubei Province stayed at $435/t for DAP with 64% content, and delivered prices for North and East China destinations are $460-468/t for DAP with 64% content, the same as last week. Southwest China’s DAP makers also focus on export markets. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465-473/t, and $475-483/t for Indian destinations.\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 546,000 tons, up 191,000 tons from last week; of that, 150,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 200,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 70,000 tons in Beihai Port, 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 50,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 10,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets remained stable, like last week; the main MAP makers processed existing orders; some have orders that could last to the beginning of next month.\\nIn Central China, Hubei Province’s MAP spot markets remained tight, and prices stayed high. Some MAP makers declined new orders and waited to see the market develop. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $347/t for powder MAP\\nPage 4\\nwith 55% content, and $371-379/t for powder MAP with 60% content, almost the same as last week.\\nSouthwest China MAP makers continued to maintain low operating rates for powder MAP units, and some of them switched over to granular MAP products. Export markets turned flat; the existing orders can last 15-20 days. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $331-339/t for powder MAP with 55% content, $339-347/t for granular MAP with 55% content and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nThe main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 115,000 tons, down 30,000 tons from last week, including 40,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 10,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port, 15,000 tons Laizhou Port and 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port.\\nSSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets remained stable overall; in Yunnan and Hubei provinces, mainstream ex-factory prices were unchanged at $58-66/t for SSP (12%) and $77-81/t for SSP (16%).\\nDomestic TSP markets were steady this week. Mainstream FOB prices are stable at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 111,000 tons, up 4,000 tons from last week – 60,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 4,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 17,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.\\nDomestic FMP markets were still quiet. Some producers in the main regions overhauled; they plan to resume production at the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphates\\nThe global phosphates market trade is again moving on the slow rate. For now in Asia, the main markets are Pakistan for the spot DAP, Bangladesh for the contract DAP, and for India DAP under the China MoU business. Compared to June, the India price is a bit lower in mid/high low $470s/t cfr. For Saudi Arabia DAP, there is no deal said for July shipment under the Saudi Arabia contracts. The China exports to Vietnam and Southeast Asia are heard in $480s/t cfr. For the Western markets, the trend follows different directions. For Europe, the price of DAP is flat in $520s/t fot ex store at the main ports. For USA domestic, the price of DAP and MAP are firming, now to low $430s/short ton fob barge. In South America, the MAP 11-52 price ideas of importers starts in $480s/t cfr Brazil, but the supplier offers are still holding up in $490s/t cfr. For Brazil TSP, price offers stay close to $390/t cfr.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur market prices stayed high. Due to strong international sulfur prices, domestic traders showed optimism, declining to lower prices to increase sales volume. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $174-189/t in Northeast China, $198-210/t in North China, $194-205/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $195-206/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur prices continued the upswing on the whole. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 936,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 4,000 tons from last week, with 330,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 110,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 100,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 34,000 tons in Beihai Port and 260,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were stable; the rock producers who had previously stopped mining began to resume production gradually. Recently, sales were disappointing. In the international market, phosphate rock prices also stayed unchanged. Guizhou Province phosphate rock markets fluctuated little. Some rock mines remained idle due to previous rainfall. Producers generally are selling down inventory because of operational difficulties that come with the rainy season. Resuming production depends on the weather. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock market prices kept constant; mainstream rock prices are $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock markets remained stable; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content.\\n\\uf075NPK\\nDomestic NPK – Domestic NPK markets looked quiet this week. The market\\'s reaction to autumn fertilizer policies and prices announced by some of the main NPK makers was not obvious. Mainstream prices stayed at $323-339/t for\\nPage 5\\nMOP-NPK (15-15-15), $371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China’s Shandong Province, the main NPK makers began to announce their autumn fertilizer pricing policies. The new mainstream ex-factory prices there are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Shanxi Province’s NPK markets remained weak overall. The local producers lowered their operating rates slightly. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Central China, Hubei Province NPK markets were still steady; new autumn NPK prices were higher than at the same time of last year. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-368/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).\\nPotash\\n\\uf075Domestic potash\\nDomestic demand for MOP did not improve overall. The wait-and-see atmosphere was still predominant. As MOP sales are off season, inventories are sufficient and sales have become a concern. Having received plenty of orders recently, Qinghai Yanhu raised its prices by $11/t at the beginning of this month. Other small factories in Qinghai Province maintained stable prices. Yanhu Group keeps its MOP units running at full load; its MOP capacity is 5.5 million tons. Yanhu produces 15,000 tons per day. Its prices are $323/t for white MOP with 60% content, up $11/t from last week. Golmud Zangge produces 7,000 tons per day; its price for white MOP with 60% content is stable at $323/t.\\nwith 50% content, and $500-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s units have remained idle since June 27 for a two-month overhaul. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.7 million tons. The firm’s SOP prices remained stable: powder SOP with 51% content is $452/t and granular SOP with 51% content is $484/t.\\nIn the seaport markets for imported MOP, the supply was adequate overall. Prices were unchanged: Russian red MOP with 60% content sells for $323-339/t in most seaports; Russian white MOP with 62% content is $339-342/t. In the border trade market, Russia sent almost no new MOP products to Northeast China by railway this month. The local prices stayed at $311/t for Russian white MOP with 62% content.\\nDomestic SOP markets were steady on the whole. The main SOP makers maintained stable operating rates, and their mainstream prices stayed at $452-484/t for powder SOP\\n\\uf075International potash\\nIn Asia, the main focus of the spot market gets back on standard MOP. Canpotex is presenting a new target for sMOP at $335pt cfr to all SE Asia import markets. This is up about $15-18 from last business of bulk cargoes to the large markets of Indonesia and Malaysia. The market activity is slow for the granular grade in the Western markets. Brazil, the price of imported granular MOP continues flat in range mid $320s-mid 330/t cfr. This is in the line of June export prices. In the USA, the domestic fill prices announcements at $355pst fob means inland market is now lined with the\\nPage 6\\nProject\\nWet Process Phosphoric Acid, Ammonium Phosphate and NPK Plants Built in 2014\\n1 Shenzhen Batian’s Guizhou Branch put a new 200,000 tpy water-soluble NPK line in Weng’an of Guizhou into operation in March 2014.\\n2 Anhui Liuguo Chemical put a new industrial MAP plant in Dangyang of Hubei into operation in April 2014.\\n3 Yuntianhua affiliate Three Circles Branch put a 10,000 tpy multi-function water-soluble fertilizer line in Kunming of Yunnan into operation in March 2014.\\n4 Shandong Kingenta put two 150,000 tpy phosphoric acid units, a 400,000 tpy sulfur-based sulfuric acid unit and a 600,000 tpy nitro-NPK line in Weng’an of Guizhou into operation in July 2014.\\n5 Hubei Yidu Xingfa put a 100,000 tpy plant for purifying phosphoric acid in Yichang of Hubei into operation in June\\n2014, employing Wengfu’s technology.\\n6 Yuntianhua affiliate Phosphate Chemical Group put an 800,000 tpy sulfur-based sulfuric acid unit, a 300,000 tpy phosphoric acid unit and a 300,000 tpy MAP unit in Kunming of Yunnan into operation in June 2014.\\n7 Anhui Sier’te closed down an old 430,000 tpy compound fertilizer plant at its old site, and put a new plant in Xuancheng of Anhui into operation in the first half of 2014, including a 250,000 tpy MAP unit, a 300,000 tpy pyrite-based sulfuric acid unit, a 100,000 tpy NPKs unit and three 200,000 tpy chloride-NPK units.\\n8 Sinochem Kailin put a 200,000 tpy TSP unit in Guiyang of Guizhou into operation in August 2014.\\n9 Shandong Luxi Chemical put a 1 million tpy nitro-NPK plant in Liaocheng of Shandong into operation in October 2014.\\nStory & Analysis\\nQuick Glance at China’s Ammonium Chloride Market\\nCapacity and production\\nChina’s ammonium chloride capacity reached about 15.89 million tpy at the end of 2014, according to China Soda Industry Association.\\nRoughly, the geographical distribution of China’s ammonium chloride capacity is: 1) Jiangsu, 25.7%; 2) Sichuan, 15.9%; 3) Hubei, 12.6%; 4) Henan, 10.1%; 5) Hebei, 5.0%; 6) Shanxi, 4.6%; 7) Tianjin, 4.3%; 8) Hunan, 3.7%; 9) Gansu, 3.4%; 10) Fujian, 3.1%; 11) Shaanxi, 2.9%; 12), Yunnan, 2.9%; and 13) Others, 5.9%.\\nChina’s ammonium chloride output increased from 5.1 million tons in 2004 to 6.24 million tons in 2006, 8.6 million tons in 2008, 9.15 million tons in 2010 and 12.5 million tons in 2013.\\nAccording to the CSIA, last year a few domestic producers shut down ammonium chloride plants, including Sichuan Zigong Honghua, 0.5 million tpy; Hebei Shuanglian, 0.5 million tpy; Henan Pingdingshan, 0.3 million tpy; Shanxi Fengxi, 0.3 million tpy; Sichuan Zigong Fuyuan, 0.1 million tpy; and Jiangsu Kunshan Jingang, 0.6 million tpy. In addition, Sichuan Hebang will shut down a 0.3 million tpy ammonium chloride plant.\\nFive factors impacting the ammonium chloride market\\nChina’s ammonium chloride enterprises have been coping\\nwith low prices for their product for years now. In the second half of 2013, the prices of ammonium chloride averaged RMB 640/t, more than RMB 200/t lower than in the first half of that year. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, the average price kept declining, dropping from RMB 640/t to RMB 350/t. Then the price trend flattened until April 2015, when prices started to rebound and climbed to RMB 550/t in mid-June.\\nFive factors are believed to have influenced the domestic ammonium chloride market.\\nFirst, China’s capacity for ammonium chloride is big.\\nSecond, the prices of urea have been low, placing great pressure on the ammonium chloride market.\\nThird, China’s output of both ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate has increased significantly in recent years, and these products have in part replaced the use of ammonium chloride in NPK production.\\nFourth, the shift toward tower granulation NPK and high concentration NPK has reduced the use of ammonium chloride. Urea and liquid ammonia are used as raw materials for making high concentration NPK. Ammonium chloride is mainly used as raw material for making low- and medium-concentration NPK products.\\nFinally, China’s export of ammonium chloride has been\\nPage 7\\nsmall.\\nProposals for a better supply/demand balance\\n1 Increase the export of ammonium chloride. China’s ammonium chloride exports have been low. The country’s annual export of ammonium chloride averages only about 3% of its annual ammonium chloride output.\\n2 Make granulated ammonium chloride that can be used\\ndirectly as a fertilizer in agricultural production. Currently, most domestic ammonium chloride products are used as raw materials in NPK production.\\n3 Some soda enterprises that employ Hou’s process can switch over to other technologies to produce soda, consequently reducing the country’s ammonium chloride output.\\nEnergy Efficient Makers of Advanced Fertilizers & Chemicals\\nThese enterprises are China’s most energy-efficient makers of advanced fertilizers or methanol:\\n1 Ammonia makers that use lump anthracite as raw material\\n1)Henan Xinlianxin Fertilizer Ltd;\\n2)Shanxi Tianze Chemical Group;\\n3)JAMG Shandong Lianmeng Chemical Ltd.\\n2 Ammonia makers that use briquette anthracite as raw material\\n1)ChemChina Henan Junma Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Fujian Zhisheng Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Hubei Yihua Chemical Ltd.\\n3 Ammonia makers that use bitumite or lignite as raw material\\n1)Shandong Hualu Hengsheng Group;\\n2)JAMG Jiangsu Linggu Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Shaanxi Weihe Heavy Chemical Ltd.\\n4 Ammonia makers that use natural gas as raw material\\n1)Chongqing Jianfeng Industrial Group;\\n2)Sichuan Tianhua Corporation;\\n3)China BlueChem.\\n5 Methanol makers that use bitumite as raw material\\n1)JAMG Anhui Zhongneng Chemical Ltd;\\n2)JAMG Anhui Haoyuan Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Shandong Hualu Hengsheng Group.\\n6 Methanol makers that use natural gas as raw material\\n1)Sichuan Lutianhua Lüyuan;\\n2)China BlueChem Jiantao Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Inner Mongolia Boyuan Lianhe Chemical Ltd.\\n7 Methanol makers that use oven gas as raw material\\n1)Shanxi Jiantao Lubao Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Linhuan Coking Corporation;\\n3)Shenhua Wuhai Energy Ltd affiliate Xilaifeng Coal Chemical’s Methanol Plant.\\n8 Soda and ammonium chloride makers that employ Hou’s process\\n1)Henan Jinshan Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Jiangsu Huachang Chemical Ltd;\\n3)CNSG Anhui Red Sifang.\\n9 MAP makers that employ traditional process\\n1)Guiyang Kailin Fertilizer Ltd;\\n2)Yunnan Hongxiang Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Yunnan Three Circles Chemical Ltd.\\n10 MAP makers that employ slurry process\\n1)Guiyang Kailin Fertilizer Ltd;\\n2)Hefei Sifang Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Ltd;\\n3)Sinochem Chongqing Fuling Chemical Ltd.\\n11 DAP makers that employ traditional process\\n1)Yunnan Tian’an Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Hubei Dayukou Chemical Ltd;\\n3)Wengfu (Group) Ltd.\\n12 Sulfuric acid makers that use sulfur as raw material\\n1)Yidu Xingfa Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Yunnan Three Circles Chemical Ltd;\\n3)JAMG Hubei Sanning Chemical Ltd.\\n13 Sulfuric acid makers that use pyrite as raw material\\n1)Tongling Chemical Group affiliate Huaxing Chemical Ltd;\\n2)Zhejiang Juhua Ltd’s Sulfuric Acid Plant;\\n3)Shandong Bofeng Lizhong Chemical Ltd.\\nPage 8\\nFertilizer Price Watch\\n※Pick up at the factory by buyer’s own truck\\n*Delivered price to the eastern and northern regions.\\nBuy, Sell & Stock of Supply and Marketing Cooperative System\\nNote: Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union System (SMCUS) includes Sino-Agri, and the provincial, municipal and county-level agricultural means of production companies.

The country’s key fertilizer makers, including Sinofert, Kingenta, Yuntianhua, Hubei Yihua, JAMG Henan Jinkai, Wengfu Group, Liaoning Huajin and Guizhou Kailin, were invited to send representatives to the conference. Shandong Province’s fertilizer department, Hebei Province’s fertilizer department, CNCIC, CNFA and CPCIA also sent representatives.\\nThe key fertilizer makers reported on their operations, talked about their difficulties and made suggestions.\\nThe country’s fertilizer production and exports have increased this year. According to the NBS, in the first half of this year, China produced 24.321 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer (N 100%), up 3.7% y/y, of which 16.798 million tons was urea, up 6.1% y/y; the country’s 1H phosphate fertilizer output was 9.563 million tons (P2O5), up 12.8% y/y; and the 1H potash fertilizer output was 2.814 million tons (K2O), up 11.1% y/y.\\nChina’s fertilizer industry’s overall operating income for the first five months of this year was RMB 371.83 billion, up 7.5% y/y, with a profit of RMB 10.99 billion, up 31.1% y/y.\\n○Issues in China’s Nitrogen Fertilizer and Methanol Industry Operations\\nAt CNFA’s 2015 China Nitrogen Fertilizer and Methanol Conference held July 16-18 in Erdos city of Inner Mongolia AR, GU Zongqin, head of CNFA, pointed out four issues in the country’s nitrogen fertilizer and methanol industry operations:\\n1 Capacity is in surplus. Overheated construction of new fertilizer and methanol plants around the country has resulted in average annual capacity growth of 5% for nitrogen fertilizer and 14% for methanol from 2011 to 2015. The country’s average nitrogen fertilizer plant operating rate is about 76%, and the average methanol plant operating rate is only about 66%.\\n2 The nitrogen fertilizer product structure needs improvement. Efficiency-enhanced fertilizers and special fertilizers are to be further developed to increase the country’s fertilizer efficiency.\\n3 Some key technologies are to be developed. Efforts are to be made to raise the technological level in the nitrogen and methanol industries, especially for urea production, large compressors and air separation.\\n4 Operating costs are steadily getting higher. From 2011 to 2015, the prices of natural gas for nitrogen fertilizer\\nproduction have increased by 56%; the prices of electricity have increased by 42%; and the prices of rail delivery of nitrogen fertilizers have increased by 65%. In the same period, expenditures for marketing nitrogen fertilizers increased by 104%; expenditures for management increased by 32%; expenditures for financing increased by 103%; and expenditures for banks’ interest increased by 107%. The enterprises face greater challenges.\\n○2015 World Potash Conference on July 9-11 in\\nGolmud of Qinghai Province\\n2015 World Potash Conference was held on July 9-11 in Golmud City of Qinghai Province, with about 800 people from nine countries attending. This event was organized jointly by China Inorganic Salt Industry Association’s Potash Branch, Qinghai Salt Lake Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the government of Golmud City.\\nOn the afternoon of July 9, XIN Guobin, vice governor of Qinghai Province, opened the conference. Key speeches were given by LI Yongwu, head of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation; PAN Aihua, vice director of the department of raw materials at MIIT, and WU Mingjue, head of China Inorganic Salt Industry Association.\\nIn his speech, LI Yongwu said that in the coming five years, China’s potash industry will improve its industrial structure, continue to develop the country’s potash bases in Qinghai Province and Xinjiang AR, and strengthen the development of overseas potash bases. On July 10, nearly twenty experts made very challenging presentations.\\nThe attendees of the conference agreed that a mechanism should be established for stockpiling potash fertilizers in the off seasons, when prices are low in international markets.\\n○CNFA’s July 15 Conference for Renewing Technical\\nCommittee\\nChina Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association held a work conference on July 15 in Erdos City of Inner Mongolia AR to renew its technical committee. The conference was chaired by KONG Xianglin, former director of the CNFA’s technical committee. GU Zongqin, head of the CNFA, was elected as the director of the new technical committee, which has 84 technical members.\\nVice directors of the CNFA’s new technical committee are LIU Jincheng, deputy president of Hebei Yangquan Coal Zhengyuan Chemical Group; LI Xuchu, vice president of Sichuan Jinxiang Sairui Chemical Ltd; MO yuan, vice general engineer of CNPC Ningxia Petrochemical Ltd; LI Zhijian, director of the fertilizer department at the Petroleum and Chemical Planning Institute; CAO Zhangao, general engineer of the CNFA.\\n○Inner Mongolia AR’s 1H Coal Production and Coal\\nPage 2\\nPrices\\nIn the first half of this year, Inner Mongolia AR produced 453 million tons of crude coal, down 7.3% y/y. Coal prices at the region’s mines average RMB 127/t, down RMB 35/t from the beginning of this year, and down RMB 39/t y/y.\\n○JAMG’s 1H Ammonia and Urea Production\\nShanxi Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group announced that the group’s affiliates produced 7.85 million tons of ammonia and 7.28 million tons of urea in the first half of this year.\\nThe group’s coal chemical operations achieved a combined\\nprofit of RMB 96.67 million for the same period.\\n○China BlueChem Dayukou Let 0.49 Million Tons of Fertilizer Delivered in 1H 2015\\nIn the first half of this year, China BlueChem Dayukou Company delivered 491,700 tons of fertilizers, up 24% y/y. More specifically, the company sent 271,300 tons of fertilizer to domestic markets and 220,400 tons to overseas markets.\\nWith regard to transport, 227,600 tons went by rail, and 264,100 tons was trucked.\\nMarket\\nHighlights this week\\n\\uf06eUrea markets down\\n\\uf06eAmmonium sulfate markets fluctuating slightly\\n\\uf06eDAP markets steady\\n\\uf06eSulfur markets stable\\n\\uf06eMOP markets still unchanged\\n\\uf06eExchange Rate: USD 1 = RMB 6.2\\nUrea\\n\\uf075Production\\nChina’s prill urea output was 749.9kt during the third week of July, up 2.13% from the week before. Granular output was down slightly by 1.08%, reaching 159.5kt. According to statistics of 22 July, daily urea output was 182.2kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 70.9%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 78.73%, while gas-based producers’ average is 52.23%.\\n\\uf075Domestic market\\nUnsurprisingly, domestic urea markets started to quieten down because a seasonal agricultural cycle ended. At this stage, urea shipments in the main regions remain weak; prices dropped again. Industrial demand is also slight. Some\\nurea makers expressed concern about excess inventory. Considering the low export prices, they tend to reduce their shipments to seaports and wait to see the market develop in August.\\nIn North China, Hebei Province’s urea markets were stable; some urea makers stopped production and overhauled. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $263-266/t. In East China, Jiangsu Province’s urea market prices were unchanged. Local shipments were normal; but the season’s agricultural demand came to an end. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $285-294/t. In Central China’s Hubei Province, local urea markets remained weak; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $277-282/t. In Southwest China, urea prices in Sichuan Province dropped somewhat; corn fertilizer application has ended. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $279-287/t.\\nPage 3\\nUrea inventories in the main seaports amount to 508,000 tons, up only 1,000 tons from last week; of that, 200,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 40,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 70,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 60,000 tons in Jinzhou Port, 24,000 tons in Yingkou Port and 39,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets still remained weak and prices kept steady. Sales in most of the main regions were discouraging. Demand remained slack. Some coal companies planned to adjust prices, but they tended to keep the prices strong.\\nNorth China coal sales were also sluggish, as buyers remained cautious. Worries about local coal inventory levels increased gradually. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central China, Henan Province\\nanthracite prices dropped a bit, by $1-2/t; agricultural demand was weak. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $149/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $151/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite markets were normal; some producers in Guizhou Province set cautious coal production rates. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $119/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate market prices fluctuated slightly; some high prices dropped a bit. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 66.3% average operating rate, down 0.9% from last week; caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 73% on average, down 3% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-102/t in Shanxi Province, $103-113/t in Hebei Province, $113-119/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.\\nOn 23 July, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $110/t, down $10/t from last week. On the same day, Hebei Qianan Jiujiang held a 960-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the selling price was $110/t, down $13/t from last week. On 24 July, Shanxi Coking auctioned 600 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the starting price was $97/t, but the sale finally failed.\\nThe main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 75,000 tons, up 5,000 tons from last week, with 25,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 5,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 45,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.\\nPhosphate & NPK\\n\\uf075Production\\nTypical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady overall. With the autumn fertilizer application period approaching, more and more traders and distributors enquired about prices, and prices stayed high; distributors hold a strong wait-and-see attitude.\\nCentral China DAP markets still remained stable overall. Most DAP makers processed existing orders, sending output mainly to North China, East China and Xinjiang AR. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content in Hubei Province stayed at $427-435/t, and the same product delivered to North and East China destinations is $460-468/t; delivered prices for Xinjiang AR destination are $484-500/t. Southwest China’s DAP makers continued to\\npay attention to export; they have plenty of export orders to keep them busy till the end of last month. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are $465-470/t.\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 451,000 tons (significantly down by 70,000 tons from last week); of that, 120,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 150,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 70,000 tons in Beihai Port, 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 30,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 15,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nPage 4\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets remained stable on the whole. Some of the main NPK companies downstream have plenty of raw material MAP on hand; they are in no rush to purchase, given the current MAP market conditions. Some small NPK producers have not started to buy raw material MAP. New orders are rare; the workload is limited to some existing orders. Most MAP makers manage smooth sales and have no inventory worries.\\nIn Central China, Hubei Province’s Map market prices were almost unchanged; the main MAP producers were fulfilling existing orders, which could last to the end of August. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $355/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $395/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nSouthwest China MAP markets remained normal; prices stayed steady. Most of the season’s export orders had been finished. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan Province are $339-347/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $355/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nThe main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 100,000 tons, the same as last week, including 30,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 20,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port.\\nSSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets were stable; some of the main SSP makers in Yunnan and Hubei provinces ran at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $58-66/t for SSP (12%) and $77-81/t for SSP (16%).\\nDomestic TSP markets were still steady overall. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 107,000 tons, like last week – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 17,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.\\nDomestic FMP markets were quiet on the whole; some makers in Yunnan Province remained idle. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphates\\nThe international markets for DAP and MAP are trading slowly. For the West, the USA local market is still having some strength to increase price for DAP barges at $435-438/short ton barge. As such in this line, the USA starts to be attractive for the export cargoes moving to US Gulf. The US export value however is lower to $465/t fob bulk, as it follows the general slow activity of Latin America markets. The MAP 11-52 for Brazil is at $480/t cfr. For Europe there is also a decline of prices. Now the DAP level is said in $515/t cfr North Europe. It keeps North Africa price about $500/t fob Morocco. The Asia business starts to have lower volume activity. For Saudi Arabia DAP, there is no August export DAP conclusion so far for India. China exporters try to hold onto bulk cargo level of $460/t fob.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur markets stabilized; some traders still\\nwaited to see how the market goes. The main refineries maintained low sulfur inventories; their domestic orders can keep them busy. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $173-189/t in Northeast China, $203-210/t in North China, $194-208/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $197-206/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur market prices dropped a bit remained high. So the seaport sulfur markets are deadlocked. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 915,000 tons of sulfur on hand, down 43,000 tons from last week, with 320,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 140,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 105,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 40,000 tons in Beihai Port and 220,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets remained steady overall, with no price adjustments. Some of the main rock producers are maintaining a normal pace of production and shipments. In Guizhou Province, the local phosphate rock markets saw a little improvement on the whole. Slightly more new orders are arriving. FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock makers kept their prices unchanged; mainstream rock prices are stable at $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies slowed their mining activities due to frequent rainfall; rock prices there are $42/t for 28% content. In\\nPage 5\\nPage 6\\nafter there are new attempts put before US Congress to re-establish the import sanctions block against Belarus MOP imports. For now, the internal US potash pre-season business is slow, as the NOLA indication stays near to\\n$310/short ton barge. In South America, the price of the Brazil granular MOP imports is still in the mid $320s/t cfr, or up to $340/t cfr for the other nearby Latin import markets.\\nProject\\nChina’s New SOP Plants to Be Completed in 2015 & 2016\\nPlants using MOP & sulfuric acid as raw materials\\nTwenty three domestic firms are constructing SOP plants around the country using MOP and sulfuric acid as a raw materials.

The combined SOP capacity of the country’s 91 SOP makers that produce SOP based on MOP and other raw materials was 3.32 million tpy.\\nIn 2014, the nine natural brine-based SOP firms produced\\n2.01million tons of SOP; and these 91 MOP-based SOP makers produced 1.982 million tons of SOP.\\nAs many new SOP plants are being constructed around the country that will be completed this year or next year, the country’s total SOP capacity is projected to reach about 8 million tpy by the end of 2016.\\nForeign trade\\nChina’s annual SOP imports fluctuated around 150,000 tons during the past decade. The peak annual SOP import volume was seen in 2006, when China imported 246,700 tons. In 2009, China imported only 90,500 tons. After that, the volume rose continually until 2012, when the country imported more than 165,700 tons. With the increase of\\nPage 7\\ndomestic SOP output, the volume imported declined to 113,800 tons in 2013 and to 54,800 tons in 2014.\\nHeilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia AR, Shandong Province, Yunnan Province and Guangdong Province are China’s main SOP importers.\\nChina exported 52,900 tons of SOP in 2006, 59,700 tons in 2007, and 26,100 tons in 2009. In the period from 2009 to 2013, the country’s SOP exports were very small due to high tariffs on SOP export. Last year, China lowered the tariff to RMB 600/t, so the export volume reached 62,700 tons.\\nChina was a net exporter of SOP last year. Before that, the country had been a net importer for many years.\\nConsumption\\nChina’s annual consumption of SOP hovered around 2.5\\nmillion tons for ten years until 2012. Since then, many new NPK plants have been constructed around the country, demanding more SOP. China’s 2014 apparent consumption of SOP reached 4 million tons.\\nNPK production is China’s principal use of SOP, consuming an estimated 1.7-1.8 million tons annually.\\nIt is also estimated that about 600,000 tons or 700,000 tons of SOP is directly applied in the country’s agricultural production annually. Around 200,000 tons of SOP is consumed in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces for tobacco production annually. Another 200,000 tons is consumed for tobacco production in the central and northern areas annually. In South China, about 100,000 tons of SOP is used for fruits and vegetables annually. In the Northeast, about 100,000 tons of SOP is used for potatoes annually.\\nCompany Profile: SDIC Xinjiang Luobupo Potash Ltd\\nSDIC Xinjiang Luobupo Potash completed a 1.2 million tpy SOP plant in November 2008. Before that, the company constructed a 100,000 tpy potash fertilizer unit. Last year, the company launched a 300,000 tpy SOP expansion project. The company is raising its potash fertilizer capacity from the present 1.3 million tpy to 1.6 million tpy by 2017.\\nThe firm produced 1.325 million tons of SOP in 2011, 1.37 million tons in 2012, 1.39 million tons in 2013 and 1.43 million tons in 2014.\\nSince 2005, the company has produced a total of 7.48 million tons of SOP and sold 7.54 million tons.\\nPage 8\\nFertilizer Price Watch\\n※Pick up at the factory by buyer’s own truck\\n*Delivered price to the eastern and northern regions.\\nBuy, Sell & Stock of Supply and Marketing Cooperative System\\nNote: Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union System (SMCUS) includes Sino-Agri, and the provincial, municipal and county-level agricultural means of production companies.

In East China, Shandong Province’s urea markets are unchanged overall. There were some agriculture purchases in some areas; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $256-268/t. In Central China’s Henan Province, local urea prices went\\nPage 3\\ndown again; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $261-266/t. In Southwest China, urea prices in Yunnan Province remained stable; shipments have stopped during the off season. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $298-305/t.\\nUrea inventories in the main seaports amount to 568,000 tons, up 60,000 tons from last week; of that, 220,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 100,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 70,000 tons in Rizhao Port, 70,000 tons in Jinzhou Port and 40,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets kept running steady on the whole. Mainstream sale prices remained stable. Most coal companies in the main regions held comfortable inventories.\\nNorth China coal demand was sluggish as usual. The local distributors kept cautious, watching the market develop. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $123-127/t in Yangquan and Jincheng, the same as last week. In Central\\nChina, Henan Province anthracite markets remained sluggish; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $149/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $151/t in Yongcheng, like last week.\\nSouthwest China’s anthracite markets remained normal. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $119/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate markets remained fatigued and prices dropped a bit. Focused on reducing inventory, some producers tried to slow production down. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 66.1% average operating rate, down slightly 0.2% from last week; however, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers are operating at about 80% on average, up significantly 7% from last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $94-100/t in Shanxi Province, $102-108/t in Hebei Province, $113-118/t in East China, $97-105/t in Northeast China, and $90-100/t in Southwest China.\\nOn 28 July, Hubei Wuhan Steel auctioned 300 tons of ammonium sulfate on the internet; the final transaction price was $121/t. Two days later, Hebei Huafeng tendered ammonium sulfate, selling at $99/t, down $11/t from last week. On the same day, Shanxi Taiyuan Steel held a 750-ton ammonium sulfate tender; the starting price was $93/t, but the sale finally failed.\\nThe main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 110,000 tons, up 35,000 tons from last week, with 30,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 10,000 tons in Qingdao Port and 70,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.\\nPhosphate & NPK\\n\\uf075Production\\nTypical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 70% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province, and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and still maintains an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets kept steady for another week. More and more traders and distributors enquired about prices, but sales were rare. The main DAP makers focus on export markets, negotiating new orders and sending output to seaports were their current key points.\\nCentral China DAP markets were almost unchanged overall. Most DAP makers continued to fulfill existing orders, sending output to North China, East China and Xinjiang AR. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content in Hubei Province stayed at $427-435/t, and the same product\\ndelivered to North and East China destinations is $460-468/t; delivered prices for Xinjiang AR destination are $484-500/t. Southwest China’s DAP makers still paid attention to export this week; they had plenty of export orders to keep them busy till the end of this month, sending product to India and Pakistan. Mainstream FOB prices for DAP with 64% content are around $465/t.\\nPage 4\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 476,000 tons (up by 25,000 tons from last week); of that, 140,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 110,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 16,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 80,000 tons in Beihai Port, 70,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 40,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 20,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets fluctuated little. The main MAP makers had few new orders in hand and worked to fulfill existing orders. Downstream, NPK companies were unwilling to purchase raw material MAP, considering the current market conditions.\\nIn Central China, Hubei Province’s Map markets remained steady, and prices were almost constant. Some of the main MAP producers were fulfilling existing orders, but new orders were rare. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $355/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $387-395/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nSouthwest China MAP output started to exceed shipments; the prices of some MAP makers dropped a bit. Export orders for granular MAP also decreased somewhat. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces are $331/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $347/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nThe main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 147,000 tons, up 47,000 tons from last week, including 47,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 70,000 tons in Nanjing Port.\\nSSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets remained stable; some of the main SSP makers ran at full load, while some others also maintained high operating rates. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $58-66/t for SSP (12%) and $77-81/t for SSP (16%).\\nDomestic TSP markets remained normal overall. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t for another week. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 107,000 tons – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 17,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.\\nDomestic FMP markets remained sluggish on the whole; some makers in Yunnan Province remained idle but planned to resume production this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $71-77/t for FMP (12%) and $87-94/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphates\\nThe international phosphates market remains showing the divided trends for East and West. There are the reports indicating a new, but small round of DAP importing business to India. This is for mainly China DAP in mid/high $470s/t cfr, giving flat trend. Some further Saudi DAP is being discussed for in the area of $480/t cfr. The China price would be unchanged, but the Saudi level would suggest the small decreases from the earlier levels. Pakistan is in the more quiet mode after the large buying of June/July. In the Americas market there is very slow activity.\\nThe USA domestic purchasing has gone back to the slow levels, and NOLA DAP price reference stays at near $435/t short tonne. The Latin America import markets for MAP are inactive, as the seller offers are reduced to $480s/t cfr Brazil/Argentina on the trader volumes from Russia. The price from Morocco however is still targeted in $490s/t cfr from OCP. For Europe, the DAP price also sees some challenge from the buyers, the interest now to low $520s/t cfr.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur markets went flat; orders were rare and the wait-and-see atmosphere was even stronger than last week. The main refineries showed concern about high sulfur inventories; some started to limit their production, while others were forced to cut their prices. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $173-189/t in Northeast China, $203-210/t in North China, $194-208/t in East China, $182-194/t in South China and $197-206/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur markets tended toward stability. Inventories of imported sulfur continued to grow. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 959,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 44,000 tons more than last week, with 390,000 tons in Nantong Port, 60,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 165,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 100,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 5,000 tons in Beihai Port, 15,000 tons in Longkou Port and 210,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPage 5\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets were still stable, and the shipments moved as usual. In Guizhou Province, the local phosphate rock markets fluctuated little overall. Mainstream rock prices remained steady; FOT prices for 30% content are $55/t from Wengan and $65/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock markets were stable on the whole; the main rock producers maintained stable prices. Mainstream rock prices are stable at $42-45/t for 28% content at Mabian, $35/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies kept mining at a slow pace due to frequent rainfall; their rock prices stayed at $42/t for 28% content. In Central China, Hubei Province phosphate rock markets saw little improvement: $65-77/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.\\n\\uf075NPK\\nwhole. Only some cash crops gave rise to fertilizer demand. The NPK supply there is adequate; mainstream ex-factory prices are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $355/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In North China, Shanxi Province’s NPK makers kept cautious to purchase raw material urea and MAP. Presently, mainstream ex-factory prices there are $298-306/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $347-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Central China, Hubei Province NPK makers maintained stable operating rates, but high summer temperatures worked against local NPK production. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $274-290/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-368/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).\\nDomestic NPK – Against the background of the newly announced autumn fertilizer offerings, domestic NPK markets remained depressed. Although the prices of raw materials were still high, most distributors and producers continued to hold a wait-and-see attitude. Mainstream prices are $306-323/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $355-371/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China, Jiangxi Province’s markets remained stable on the\\nPage 6\\nDomestic SOP markets remained stable; the main SOP makers kept prices unchanged, and their operating rates averaged about 70%. Mainstream prices are $452-484/t for powder SOP with 50% content and $500-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s units have remained idle since June 27 for a two-month overhaul. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.7 million tons. The firm’s SOP prices remained stable: powder SOP with 51% content is $452/t and granular SOP with 51% content is $484/t.\\n\\uf075International potash\\nIn the global potash markets, the attention is returning to SE Asia markets. The discussion for strong potential interest\\nin SE Asia is not seen as yet. The main suppliers are starting now to anticipated for some interest in tenders for Indonesia, but the level of local currency against the US dollar is under great pressure. The last Malaysia spot levels at $310-315/t cfr are now below the target for new Canada business in $335/t cfr for standard and $350/t cfr for granular. The South America import granular MOP price is said to see some weakness now to $320/t cfr. Similar sentiment is being noted for the USA internal markets for the US barge price to be also weakening to the level of $305-310/short ton barge. For Europe, the price levels stay near €300/t cfr for the granular MOP grade.\\nProject\\nSix Foreign-based Potash Projects\\n1 Chunhe Group’s MAG 1.2 million tpy potash fertilizer project in the Republic of Congo.\\n2 China-Kazakhstan Futong Potash’s 1.2 million tpy potash project in Kazakhstan.

Granular output was down slightly by 1.52%, reaching 168.8kt. According to statistics of 26 August, daily urea output was 194.1kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 72.02%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 76.51%, while gas-based producers’ average is 61.06%.\\n\\uf075Domestic market\\nDomestic urea markets remained stable; although the VAT has been reinstituted, prices rose by only $5/t and only in some regions. The atmosphere of wait-and-see is predominant. After the Beijing military parade, some urea makers began to resume production; highway transportation conditions improved gradually.\\nIn North China’s Hebei Province, urea makers began to resume production; prices rose slightly, by $3/t. Industrial demand increased, so prices may have space to rise further. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $245-247/t. In East China, urea market demand in Shandong Province was still weak,\\nIn Central China’s Hubei Province, the atmosphere of wait-and-see remained strong; sales were slow. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-263/t. In Southwest China’s Sichuan Province, urea markets showed a slight upward trend; the main urea makers tended to existing orders and sent output to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-266/t.\\nAccording to data from China Customs, in July China exported 1,003,726 tons of urea, down 9.6% y/y; in the first seven months, China exported 7.748 million tons of urea, up significantly by 46.7% y/y.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets declined on the whole; most of the main coal companies’ sales were still uninspiring. Demand remained depressed; even when sales were made, prices were pushed low. Domestic markets will stay weak in the short term.\\nNorth China anthracite markets stayed almost unchanged. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $111-115/t at Yangquan and Jincheng, like last week.\\nPage 3\\nIn Central China’s Henan Province, anthracite prices were also unchanged overall. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $138/t in Henan Jiaozuo and $142/t in Yongcheng. Southwest China’s anthracite markets kept steady; prices there were the same as last week. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $109/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate markets rebounded, especially in Shanxi and Hebei Provinces; where prices rose by $3-5/t. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 63% average operating rate, almost like last week; meanwhile, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers operated at about 80% on average, also the same as last week.

YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm maintained its recent low operating rate. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and maintained an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets remained stable on the whole. Facing the new cost of the resumed VAT, some DAP makers tried to raise their prices by $8-16/t; however, no sales were made at the new prices yet. Most DAP makers still maintained stable prices, due to lots of existing orders, they kept busy. Downstream, traders waited to see the market develop.\\nCentral China DAP markets stayed normal overall. Some of the main DAP makers had enough export orders to keep\\nthem busy for a month; meanwhile, some domestic orders from North China and East China were waiting to be worked. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content stayed at 422/t in Hubei Province, and the same product delivered to North China and East China destinations is $441-445/t, like last week.\\nSouthwest China’s DAP producers continued to maintain the high operating rates; orders now in hand could last to the end of this month. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content are $406-414/t, FOB prices are around $460/t; delivered to North China destinations are $441-453/t.\\nIn July, China exported 752,788 tons of DAP, up sharply by 160% y/y according to data from China Customs; in the first seven months, China exported 3.576 million tons of DAP, also up sharply, by 130% y/y.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP market prices also rose a bit, but almost no new orders were seen. Some MAP makers chose to stop quoting, waiting for further developments. Sales were weak; the wait-and-see atmosphere dominated the whole market.\\nCentral China MAP market prices went up overall; Hubei and Henan provinces’ MAP makers had some orders in hand. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $336-344/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $375-383/t for powder MAP with 60% content.\\nSouthwest China MAP producers waited to see the market develop; some raised prices. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan province are $320-331/t for powder MAP with\\nPage 4\\n55% content, and $336-344/t for powder MAP with 58% content in Yunnan Province.\\nIn July China exported 752,788 tons of MAP, down 21% y/y, according to data from China Customs; in the first seven months, China exported 3.576 million tons of MAP, up 81% y/y.\\nSSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets remained stable; most makers maintained high operating rates, some even running at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices were $56-66/t for SSP (12%) and $75-86/t for SSP (16%) in Yunnan Province.\\nDomestic TSP markets were flat on the whole; mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 110,000 tons, the same as last week – 50,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 10,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 20,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.\\nDomestic FMP makers began to resume production gradually. But everywhere, demand is insufficient to sustain the market. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Hubei Provinces are $69-75/t for FMP (12%) and $84-91/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphates\\nThe global phosphates market trade is continuing in the soft trend. The main activity is in the East as the offers for DAP exports to Pakistan and India decline to $460s/t cfr. The offer origins are mainly Saudi Arabia and China. Also Jordan is expected to supply more DAP at new market level under MoU, but there are some production troubles in Jordan plants. Some Africa demand for NPs & NPK is also coming now, as the annual tender from Ethiopia comes in September for NP19-38+S. For the DAP and MAP in the West, there is some gain in US local market to mid $430s/short ton barge NOLA. In Europe and South America however the DAP and MAP prices decline to low $500s/t cfr on DAP to West Europe and $475-480/cfr for MAP to Brazil.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur markets remained slack; demand was fatigued. Sales did not improve. Most refineries showed\\nconcern about sulfur inventory levels, selling mainly at low prices. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $156-183/t in Northeast China, $183-191/t in North China, $178-208/t in East China, $163-192/t in South China and $175-183/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur markets were slack; seaport sulfur inventories started to be sold down slowly. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 978,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 132,000 tons less than last week, with 390,000 tons in Nantong Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 255,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 80,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 20,000 tons in Beihai Port, 12,000 tons in Longkou Port and 170,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets fluctuated little overall; rock prices were stable in the main production regions. Guizhou Province rock markets saw almost no change; rock prices kept steady. FOT prices for 30% content stayed at $52/t from Wengan and $63/t from Kaiyang. Sichuan Province phosphate rock producers maintained the same operating rates as last week, and the rock prices were also constant: mainstream prices are $41-44/t for 28% content at Mabian, $34/t for 28% content at Leibo. Yunnan Province’s phosphate rock companies kept running normally. The local market saw no price changes: $58/t for 28% content, $66/t for 30% content. In Central China, Hubei Province phosphate rock market prices remained stable at low level, $63-75/t for 28-30% content in Yichang.\\n\\uf075NPK\\nDomestic NPK – After the Beijing military parade, some NPK\\nPage 5\\nmakers in Hebei and Shandong Provinces began to resume production. The main NPK companies planned to raise NPK prices due to the VAT resumption; however, the intended increment was not made public. Mainstream prices for NPK products are stable at $306-313/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In East China, Shandong Province’s NPK market prices rose a bit, by $5-13/t, but the sales volume was almost unchanged. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $297-313/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15), the same as last week. In Central China, Hubei\\nProvince’s NPK markets remained sluggish on the whole; the local market demand was not much. The downstream purchasers kept cautious, watching the market develop. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $289-305/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), $344-359/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15). In Northwest China, Shaanxi Province NPK markets saw no adjustments. Operating rates were not high, and new orders were rare due to the off season. Mainstream ex-factory prices stayed at $297/t for MOP-NPK (15-15-15), and $344/t for SOP-NPK (15-15-15).\\nPotash\\n\\uf075Domestic potash\\nDomestic MOP markets as a whole kept steady. Due to the new policy reinstituting VAT on inventory fertilizer, MOP makers raised prices to some extent. In Qinghai Province, small producers continued to increase their operating rates. Yanhu Group still ran its MOP units at full load; its MOP capacity will reach 5.5 million tpy this year. Yanhu produces 20,000 tons per day. Its prices stayed at $341/t for white MOP with 60% content. Golmud Zangge produces 6,000 tons per day; its price for white MOP with 57% content is stable at $286/t.\\nMOP import markets remained flat overall. Some importers did not announce new prices but waited to see the market trends develop further. Imported MOP inventories in seaports stayed high. Russian red MOP with 60% content sells for $317-331/t in most ports; Russian white MOP with 62% content is $341-347/t. The border trade MOP markets were still quiet; no new MOP will arrive in this month. Most traders there have suspended sales and are preparing to adjust prices.\\nDomestic SOP market prices rebounded slightly. The main SOP producers kept shipping smoothly and reduced their SOP inventories gradually; most of them showed no special concern for inventory or sales. Mainstream prices are $438-484/t for powder SOP with 50% content and\\n$484-516/t for granular SOP with 50% content. Xinjiang Luobupo Company’s SOP units resumed production 25 August, producing 4,000 tons per day. Its annual SOP capacity is 1.6 million tons. The firm’s new, higher price for granular SOP with 51% content is $508/t.\\n\\uf075International potash\\nThe market is seeing bearish atmosphere. The troubles of US dollar strength against the Malaysia and Indonesia currency is the cause of difficulty on the new imports of the standard MOP, and no notification of new tenders. The last price levels said for these markets is about $310/t cfr Malaysia bulk or low $320s/t cfr Vietnam. For the granular MOP, there is competition in Brazil market at low $300s/cfr levels, down from mid $310s/t cfr last month. Also in USA domestic there is stronger competition as the local barge price for the imported granular MOP is now going to $290s/short ton fob.\\nPage 6\\nProject\\nLuxi Chemical’s Nitro-NPK Lines in Full Operation\\nLuxi Chemical Group’s 100% subsidiary, Shandong Liaocheng Luxi Nitro-NPK Ltd, constructed three nitro-NPK lines, with a combined capacity of 600,000 tpy, and put them into operation recently.

Granular output was down significantly by 15.86%, reaching 151.5kt. According to statistics of 9 September, daily urea output was 193.6kt. Considering China’s total urea capacity to be 253kt per day, the utilization rate is 71.83%. Coal-based urea producers’ average operating rate is 75.33%, while gas-based producers’ average is 63.29%.\\n\\uf075Domestic market\\nDomestic urea market prices dropped a bit because of weak demand. More than a week had past since the Beijing military parade; urea makers had resumed production. However, seeing that current market trends are unclear, distributors were cautious in purchasing, and unwilling to keep much inventory on hand.\\nIn North China, Hebei Province urea markets remained sluggish; prices went down $3-5/t. Market demand was weak, and prices dropped almost to the bottom. Presently, mainstream ex-factory prices are $236-239/t. Also, East China urea markets were not strong in Shandong Province; the main urea makers there reduced prices further. Due to the off season, agricultural demand had stopped, while industrial buyers purchased only as needed. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $231-241/t.\\nIn Central China, Henan Province markets did not improve; prices stayed low. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $238-244/t. In Southwest China’s Sichuan Province, urea markets remained stable; mainstream ex-factory prices there are $258-266/t.\\nUrea inventories in the main seaports amount to 607,000 tons, down 102,000 tons from last week; of that, 200,000 tons is in Yantai Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 80,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port, 40,000 tons in Rizhao Port,\\nPage 3\\n20,000 tons in Yingkou Port, 180,000 tons in Jinzhou Port, 8,000 tons in Laizhou Port and 19,000 tons in Lianyungang Port.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nDomestic anthracite markets as a whole remained stable; most big coal companies’ sales remained depressed. Markets were off season. The oversupply of coal kept increasing and prices kept declining.\\nNorth China anthracite market prices fluctuated little overall. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) is offered for $111-113/t at Yangquan and Jincheng, almost unchanged from last week. In Central China’s Henan Province, anthracite prices stayed stable as usual. Middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices were $138/t in Henan Jiaozuo\\nand $142/t in Yongcheng, the same as last week. Southwest China’s anthracite markets remained unchanged; middle-size anthracite (7000 cal) prices of Guizhou Anshun are around $109/t.\\n\\uf075Ammonium Sulfate\\nDomestic ammonium sulfate markets were still on the upswing. Market demand is healthy; producers are confident in the market. Steel coking ammonium sulfate producers maintained a 64.8% average operating rate, almost up 2% from last week; meanwhile, caprolactam ammonium sulfate producers operated at about 80% on average, the same as last week. Mainstream ex-factory prices are $78-86/t in Shanxi Province, $91-97/t in Hebei Province, $94-109/t in East China, $88-100/t in Northeast China, and $94-100/t in Southwest China.\\nOn 31 August, Hebei Huafeng held an ammonium sulfate tender; the final transaction price was $95/t, up $8/t from the last tender. On 1 September, Guangdong Shaogang auctioned 3,000 tons of ammonium sulfate; the closing price was $114/t.\\nThe main seaports’ combined ammonium sulfate inventory is 150,000 tons, up 23,000 tons from last week, with 50,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 35,000 tons in Beihai Port, 5,000 tons in Yingkou Port and 60,000 tons in Qinhuangdao Port.\\nPhosphate & NPK\\n\\uf075Production\\nTypical phosphate fertilizer operating rates are 80% in Hubei Province, 70% in Yunnan Province and 80% in Guizhou Province. YUC has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity; the firm still did not raise operating rates. Wengfu has 2.6m tpy of DAP capacity and maintained an 80% operating rate. Kailin has 2.5m tpy of DAP capacity and produces about 5,000 tons per day.\\n\\uf075Domestic phosphate\\nDAP – Domestic DAP markets kept running steadily overall. Most DAP makers tended to existing orders; they made few new sales. Sales for the autumn fertilizer application period started gradually, the downstream markets in North China and East China had plenty of DAP products. Mainstream prices remained stable.\\nCentral China DAP markets were almost unchanged. The main DAP makers maintained high operating rates; some output went to domestic markets, and the rest was sent for export. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content stayed at 422/t in Hubei Province, and the same product delivered to North China destinations is $445/t; delivered to Xinjiang AR destinations is $469/t.\\nSouthwest China’s DAP producers mainly sent their products to seaports, and only some companies had\\ndomestic market orders. Mainstream ex-factory prices for DAP with 64% content are $406/t – $460-465/t FOB – and the same product delivered to North China destinations is $441-453/t.\\nDAP inventories in the main seaports amount to 453,000 tons (down by 6,000 tons from last week); of that, 120,000 tons is in Zhanjiang Port, 100,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 30,000 tons in Qinzhou Port, 80,000 tons in Beihai Port, 40,000 tons in Nanjing Port, 70,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port and 13,000 tons in Nantong Port.\\nMAP – Domestic MAP markets remained flat on the whole; after raising the prices last week, most MAP makers had no actual transaction on the new prices. The downstream NPK\\nPage 4\\npurchasers were unwilling to buy, they purchased only as needed.\\nCentral China MAP markets kept steady; Hubei and Henan provinces’ MAP makers maintained stable operating rates, with most of them focused on orders already in hand. Mainstream ex-factory prices there are $336-344/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $375-383/t for powder MAP with 60% content, the same as last week.\\nSouthwest China MAP producers lowered their operating rates ; some even chose to stop production and overhauled. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Sichuan province are $320-331/t for powder MAP with 55% content, and $336-344/t for powder MAP with 58% content in Yunnan Province, also like last week.\\nThe main seaports’ combined MAP inventory is 92,000 tons, down 53,000 tons from last week, including 30,000 tons in Yingkou Port, 27,000 tons in Fangcheng Port and 35,000 tons in Nanjing Port.\\nSSP/TSP/FMP – Domestic SSP markets showed good momentum; most makers maintained high operating rates, some even running at full load. Mainstream ex-factory prices stayed at $56-66/t for SSP (12%) and $75-86/t for SSP (16%) in Yunnan Province.\\nDomestic TSP markets kept running normally, mainly fulfilling export markets. Mainstream FOB prices stayed at $305-330/t. TSP inventories in the main seaports amount to 95,000 tons, down 15,000 from last week – 40,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 30,000 tons in Beihai Port and 25,000 tons in Qinzhou Port.\\nDomestic FMP markets were still quiet on the whole. Demand in the main markets was too low to sustain the market for long. Mainstream ex-factory prices in Yunnan and Hubei Provinces are $69-75/t for FMP (12%) and $84-91/t for FMP (15%).\\n\\uf075International phosphates\\nThe global phosphates market trade remains slow and giving the indication of down trend in Asia markets, but stable in West. For Brazil MAP 63 units, the market is having a stabilised price situation in the range $465-470/t cfr. This is for the spot offers coming from Russia in September. Russia and East Europe domestic market continues for Russian producers for the MAP and the NPKs. For the Morocco MAP to Brazil, the last reference is said at the $480/t cfr level. In NOLA market, the domestic DAP is giving the level in mid $430s/short ton fob. The main activity in Asia markets is from Pakistan, as the India demand starts to slow down to contact business only at the level in low $460s/t cfr India. The new business to Pakistan is understood in low/mid $460s/t cfr on two cargoes from China. The new tender for over 300,000t NPs to Ethiopia is coming this week. As in the last year, Morocco and Russia are main supply options.\\n\\uf075Raw materials\\nSulfur: Domestic sulfur markets did not improve, and prices\\ncontinued to fall. Sales were weak; most refineries continued to sell down their sulfur inventories. Mainstream sulfur prices around the country are as follows: $156-183/t in Northeast China, $183-191/t in North China, $175-203/t in East China, $167-188/t in South China and $177-183/t in Southwest China.\\nImported sulfur markets were still weak on the whole; seaport sulfur inventories picked up slightly. Altogether, the principal domestic ports have about 1,050,000 tons of sulfur on hand, 72,000 tons more than last week, with 362,000 tons in Nantong Port, 50,000 tons in Qingdao Port, 350,000 tons in Fangcheng Port, 80,000 tons in Zhanjiang Port, 35,000 tons in Beihai Port, 12,000 tons in Longkou Port and 160,000 tons in Zhenjiang Port.\\nSulfur Price and Inventory\\nNote: Ex-warehouse prices in the table include 17%VAT, 1% import tax and incidental expenses.\\nPhosphate rock: Domestic phosphate rock markets remained steady; rock prices saw no change. Some rock producers wanted to raise prices, but considering the current market, that would be hard to do.\\nGuizhou Province rock market prices were stable. FOT prices for 30% content stayed at $52/t from Wengan and $63/t from Kaiyang, the same as last week. Sichuan Province phosphate rock producers maintained their rock prices constant, mainstream prices stayed at $41-44/t for 28% content at Mabian, $34/t for 28% content at Leibo.\\nYunnan Province’s phosphate rock makers’ mining rates were low. Their rock prices kept unchanged: $58/t for 28% content, $66/t for 30% content. In Central China, Hubei\\nPage 5\\nPage 6\\n\\uf075International potash\\nThere is still weak tendency in the world potash markets. For the latest business, the reports are of the decline in price of granular MOP for Europe, USA and South America. For such markets the import pricing is reported to be €290s/t cfr West Europe, the $290s/short ton for New\\nOrleans and the range of $305-310/t cfr Brazil. The other South America markets are more less stable at the level $330/t cfr for granular MOP in the small volumes. In the Asia markets, the challenge of strong USD$ against the forex of all markets is still great. In Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam the forex weakness is delaying the new business, and preventing new tender activity.\\nProject\\nJAMG Hubei Jinhuarun’s Plan for Melamine, Ammonium Chloride and Soda\\nJAMG Hubei Qianjiang Jinhuarun Fertilizer Ltd, located in Qianjiang of Hubei Province, plans to construct a 150,000 tpy melamine plant, a 1 million tpy salt plant, a 1 million tpy ammonium chloride plant and a 1 million tpy soda plant.

Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.\\nYara’s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR surprised some regional traders who felt the drop in values too sharp. Others argued that it accurately represented a market awash with supply as Sabic and Petronas are still reported to have spot cargo available. It has also been suggested that Indonesia’s Pupuk Kaltim may switch from urea to greater ammonia output potentially compounding the ample supply situation, but this was not confirmed at the time of writing.\\nBASF China and FACT will certainly be hoping for lower offers in import tenders for 8,000 mt and 15,000 mt respectively which close February 5, after CJ Indonesia secured 6,000 mt spot cargo from Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR. A number of Indian buyers claim recent offers to FACT at $410/mt CFR under scrapped tenders have kept suppliers’ price ideas unrealistically high with no new offers below the $340-360/mt CFR range for spot enquiries. CIL said it will hold out for ammonia values around $320/mt CFR before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.\\nBlack Sea suppliers contend that although the market remains tough in February/March, prices are stable at $260-270/mt FOB with no urgency to sell product. OPZ remains shut on one ammonia line as Ameropa busies itself with contract commitments. Sorfert continues to run just one ammonia line while Fertial is also reported to be running just one ammonia line in Arzew due to export licence issues.\\nDespite this, buyers appear reluctant to conclude spot business west of Suez should prices fall further, citing limited demand and low prices for other fertilizers. The market will watch with interest at what price Turkey’s Gemlik must offer at to spur buying interest for possible exports after restarting ammonia production this week.\\nMosaic\\'s announcement this week of a Q1 production cut of up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphates in the US was expected, and it naturally means the phosphate giant will need less ammonia through March. The timing means it is unlikely that international suppliers will be in a position to extract a price increase at Tampa for March deliveries. Somewhat surprisingly, while speculation of a possible production cut by Mosaic was rumoured for months, similar rumours have not emerged with regard to ammonia output in Trinidad and Tobago, the main supplier of ammonia to the US Gulf.\\nAmmonia producers have cut prices by $10-22/st in all key US enduser markets, although new quotes from suppliers vary somewhat even within regions. The move is likely aimed at making up for some of the lost demand seen last fall, when wet weather substantially reduced the application window for ammonia, especially in the Midwest.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙CJ Indonesia tender awarded to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR\\n∙BASF China closing 8,000 mt import tender February 5\\n∙Namhae buys 15,000 mt from Yara at $347/mt CFR\\n∙Pupuk Kaltim may reduce urea output in favour of ammonia\\n∙FACT issues 15,000mt retender closing February 5\\n∙Mitsui buys 3,000 mt KAFCO cargo under formula price\\n∙Sabic and Petronas may have spot cargo available\\n∙Turkey\\'s Gemlik restarts ammonia output\\n∙Fertial running one ammonia line at Arzew due to export licence issues\\n∙Black Sea quiet; prices stable at $260-270/mt FOB\\nShort term outlook\\nStability west of Suez although downwards price pressure remains. There is room for further falls east of Suez as buyers push for lower values on ample supply.\\nDAP versus ammonia\\nMosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks. The company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns, which could ease the demand for ammonia.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand\\nA rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.\\nUS Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower\\nThere no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.\\nUS S. Plains: More aggressive offers\\nProducers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.\\nOrders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.\\nUS NOLA: Barge indications narrow\\nInland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week\\'s range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.\\nThe decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week\\'s range of $301-350/st FOB.\\nUS Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia\\nNot all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.\\nThere are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: November 2015 exports recover to 2013 levels\\nRussian ammonia exports for November 2015 were 300,009 mt, up on the 111,823 mt exported in the same period in 2014, and more or less in line with exports for 2013.\\nTotal exports for the January-November 2015 period were\\n3.2million mt, up 3% year-on-year boosted by increased shipments to Belgium and Finland.\\nThe largest recipient of Russian ammonia during the first 11 months of 2015 was Ukraine at 2.1 million mt, including product transported by pipeline to Odessa for export.\\nAnother 540,694 mt was destined to Belgium during the period, up 104%.\\nRussia exported 215,392 to Finland, up 9% on the prior year.\\nBlack Sea: No new trade; Ameropa charters Solaro\\nAnother quiet week in the Black Sea with values assessed stable at $260-270/mt FOB.\\nAmeropa has chartered the Solaro for 2-3 months to cover freight requirements.\\nThe vessel is slated to arrive in Yuzhnyy February 18 to load 25,000 mt, possibly for GCT Tunisia.\\nKoch’s Clipper Orion sailed February 3 with 30,000 mt OPZ product and 10,000 mt from Ameropa for SFC and Namhae in South Korea.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Gemlik restarts output\\nLocal reports suggest Gemlik restarted ammonia production this week after suspending output mid- December due to low AN values. It possible that Gemlik is now receiving cheaper gas compared with the end of 2015 due to gas contracts linked to lower oil values, making ammonia production more viable despite current prices pegged no higher than $300/mt CFR Turkey.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Fertial runs just one ammonia line\\nFertial is reported running just one ammonia line at Arzew following issues securing exports licences.\\nSorfert still has one ammonia down at its Arzew plant.\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic may have additional cargo\\nReports suggesting Sabic has an additional cargo outside contract commitments for March lifting have not been confirmed by the producer.\\nMeanwhile, it is suggested that Qafco is experiencing technical issues at Qafco IV.\\nMiddle East spot values have been assessed indicatively at $275-280/mt FOB on netbacks on Yara\\'s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR, taking into account freight costs of around $70/mt.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBangladesh: Mitsui purchases 3,000 mt from KAFCO\\nMitsui purchased 3,000 mt spot cargo from KAFCO under a formula pricing arrangement for lifting on the Gashcem Dollart February 5-6. The cargo will be taken to Singapore where Mitsui has a contract supply agreement.\\nIndia: Iran ammonia imports down, but Qatar up\\nIndian ammonia imports in November 2015 were registered by customs at 197,542 mt, a 13% increase on the same period in the prior year on greater volumes sourced from Qatar and Russia via Ukraine.\\nTotal imports for the January-November 2015 period reached 1.9 million mt, an increase of 8% year-on year.\\nIndia sourced the majority of its ammonia during the first 11 months of this year from Iran at 575,334 mt, a 5% decrease on 2014.\\nImports from Qatar were 411,929 mt, up 22%, while off- take from Russia shipped via Ukraine leapt 73% to 376,807 mt.\\nIndia: FACT retender closes February 5\\nIndian importer FACT retenders February 5 for 15,000 mt ammonia to be delivered to Cochin in two lots late February and first half March. This follows the scrapping of its February 1 session which attracted no offers.\\nIts January 21 tender for the same volume was also scrapped as offers for the two lots by Trammo and Muntajat at an identical $410/mt CFR basis sight payment were considered substantially in excess of actual spot values.\\nCIL said it will wait for ammonia values to fall to $320/mt CFR or below before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.\\nZuari said it shut down its ammonia and urea plants for maintenance from January 26, 2016.

Abu Qir\\'s tender next week will provide and indication on the extent of discounts required for buyers to re-enter with the intent of shipping to Europe.\\nSome producers are all still contemplating UAN production cuts to rather than selling at break-even at best, or at a loss.\\nAbu Qir is looking to improve on the $140/mt FOB price achieved in its January 26 tender, but this appears unlikely at present. Dependent on the outcome in its February 8 tender the producer will limit or altogether stop production of UAN.\\nBunge bought 25,000 mt of UAN from Nitron for Argentina, likely to be loaded from CF production out of the US.\\nAchema\\'s 1.36 million mt/year UAN plants are still at limited output due to a technical issue in one of its ammonia lines since January 2016. The units are expected to start production in February, with availablity ample in March.\\nGrodnoAzot remains quiet on UAN, and is reported to be continuing to place output in the domestic market, claiming returns well above those currently available in the export market.\\nUS activity is seasonaly modest, but barge offers have not declined in the last couple of weeks, while inland resale values also are relatively steady. Next week\\'s TFI annual business meeting and the March US planting forecast likely will provide key guidance for UAN prices going forward.\\nTerminals at Rouen and Germany are well covered with very little capacity to take on more UAN in the short term. Prices have declined to €150-155/mt FCA in France with Germany reporting no recent business.\\nChina will be quiet during the lunar New Year holiday period, but producers are continuing to limit production on poor netbacks. Even so there will be some quantities available to load at the end of February. The Chinese price is assessed at $145-150/mt FOB.\\nAmmonium Sulphate\\nAny hope for an big increase in demand for AS has now dissipated due to upcoming holidays in China and an end to buying for the Safrinha crop in Brazil.\\nChinese producers are in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations with caprolactam grade product now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.\\nOffers for caprolactam grade AS from China into Brazil meanwhile are widely available at $130/mt CFR, although there is little business done as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down.\\nTurkish buyers have shown some interest in securing product with KemerovoAzot linked to the sale of 6- 8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent, although other market sources contend this level is too high.\\nFinland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.\\nAmmonium Nitrate/CAN\\nAN prices remain soft for yet another week, despite the increases in urea values registered in main markets such as Brazil and Turkey. The undertone in urea is also relatively firm for forward positions, but AN will remain overpriced in the short term as FSU producers try to maintain netbacks close to $190/mt FOB for AN while quoting urea a mere $10/mt higher.\\nDemand is subdued with the exception of some small quantities for North Africa. Turkish and Brazilian buyers appear content to stay sidelined until and unless prices match urea values more closely, with premiums for the nitrates within historical levels.\\nBuyers also point to the depressed market for UAN where sales from Egypt were made last week at $140/mt FOB. That number reflected urea values around $200/mt FOB on a pure nutrient basis, while Egyptian urea traded at the time at $224/mt FOB.\\nPrices for CAN in NW Europe remain under pressure on limited demand while supply is set to increase substantially in about two weeks when OCI is due to restart its Geleen plant.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes\\nUS UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.\\nUS NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm\\nMore and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.\\nMuch of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.\\nUS Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower\\nUAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.\\nThe driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.\\nAs a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: Bunge will be supplied by Nitron\\nReports from other participants in the session suggest that Nitron booked the recent Bunge requirement for 25,000 mt of UAN-32 for Argentina at $171/mt CFR.\\nThe origin of the cargo was not revealed, but indications from the freight-market are that the parcel may load from the US.\\nBunge\\'s prior purchase for Argentina was booked October 22 with EuroChem around the $220/mt CFR marker.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: November exports continue to head for the US\\nRussia exported 103,216 mt UAN-32 in November 2015, up 12% on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.\\nRussian exports to the US in November fell 4% to 87,894 mt, but still comprise 85% of Russian exports to the US. Ukraine was the second largest receiver of UAN from Russia in November 2015 at 15,024 mt, up from zero the previous year.\\nRussia was the largest global exporter of UAN in the January-November 2015 period, followed by Lithuania. Total Russian exports for the first 11 months of this year were 1.56 million mt, a 6% decline year-on-year. Again most of its UAN volumes were directed to the US (88% market share).\\nEUROPE\\nGermany: No deals reported, pipeline and tanks are full\\nThere has been no reported activity in the German UAN market in recent weeks as storage tanks and the pipeline are full. As such an assessement of no recent business has been applied to the €173-176/mt FCA range.\\nRouen: Prices plunge to €150-155/mt FCA\\nFrench UAN-30 prices fell sharply this week to €150-155/mt FCA for March/April positions.\\nThe French UAN market remains 90% covered for the season ending April as participants hold off from buying the remainder with a belief that prices have not yet reached their floor.\\nPrice ideas for May/June fell €10/mt to around €145/mt FCA.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir issues another UAN tender\\nAbu Qir issued a new export tender for 25,000 mt UAN closing February 8 for loading from Damietta February 11-15 dates.\\nThe producer is targeting a price of $140/mt FOB in this session following its 5,000 mt sale to Trammo at this level in its January 26 tender. Should the producer fail to sell its 25,000 mt, it may elect to cut UAN production.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Markets to remain quiet for the next fortnight\\nUpcoming Chinese New Year holidays are expected to create a lull in the UAN market until the end of February.\\nAccording to reports, Chinese UAN producers Jinkai and Huaihua will recommence limited production after the holidays to build up inventories until 40-50,000 mt of UAN is available for spot sale.\\nProducers suggest they will target $150/mt FOB in future sales but buyers contest they are looking for product priced nearer $145/mt FOB.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge\\nAfter the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.\\nMexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium\\nMexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.\\nTotal imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year.\\nMexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.\\nOff-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%.\\nDue to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January-November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Little interest in AS now\\nBrazilian demand for AS is slow as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down. Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China are now reported available at the $130/mt CFR level although there is little business done.\\nSafrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20, due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This is expected to help boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: KemorovoAzot AS sale into Turkey\\nKemerovoAzot is linked to the sale of 6-8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent although other market sources contend this level is too high.\\nRussia: Reduced availability prompts fall in exports\\nRussia AS exports for November 2015 were 32,189 mt, a 49% decrease on the prior year period.\\nTotal shipments for the January-November 2015 period reached 510,841 mt, a fall of 26% on reduced availability.\\nRussia exports to Ukraine during the first 11 months of this year were 178,083 mt, up 17% year-on-year.\\nShipments to Turkey for the period were 140,977 mt, down 40%.\\nExports to Brazil more than halved at 42,422 mt as\\nChina shipped more to the south American country.\\nEUROPE\\nFinland: Norilsk Nickel offering 6-8,000 mt AS\\nFinland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Interest in AS dries up\\nInterest in Chinese AS has dried up with producers in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations. Last known sales for caprolactam grade AS were concluded in the $103-108/mt FOB range in recent weeks but product is now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nSheenal Khimasia, Writer – Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2132\\nEmail: sheenal.khimasia@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

With phosphates prices and sentiment collapsing in markets around the world, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best moment for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system. However, many sources think the cut does not go far enough and that it will remain a difficult task for producers to stabilise and possibly raise some DAP/MAP prices by the end of the first quarter.\\nMosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market. Without any new sales, the company\\'s DAP/MAP Tampa price is assessed at $350- 360/mt FOB. The US domestic benchmark at New Orleans remained essentially flat week over week.\\nIn the last two weeks more than 100,000 mt of spot MAP/DAP has been committed to the US between EuroChem and PhosAgro. These cargos are in addition to two 50,000 mt MAP/DAP cargos previously booked by Koch with OCP. Another international trader is shopping for Russian phosphates to load in February for the US if enough US buyers will commit to purchases.\\nThe Brazilian MAP market again saw declines this week as Indagro sold off further Saudi Arabian tonnage as low as $325/mt CFR. In the last two weeks, Brazil\\'s MAP import price has reduced by as much as $35/mt. Demand remains slow to build. Brazil\\'s consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to\\n4.4million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014 and imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, according to new ANDA data. Most sources suspect that there could be further declines to go in Brazil but that such low levels are likely to encourage buying later in the quarter.\\nEuropean DAP prices also saw slight reductions this week. Demand for DAP is still slow across the continent and prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. EuroChem has sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets at around $410/mt FOB while GCT has sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB. JPMC and GCT likely each have around 100,000 mt DAP being stockpiled due to weak sales and their prices have reduced again to spur on activity.\\nIn early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe. Despite this, the Moroccan DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB due to market levels.\\nVast stocks of DAP continue to impact the market in India. There is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced. A 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this\\nweek for Blue Deebaj from Chinese producers, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR and Ma\\'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380- 395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.\\nExport levels from China further reduced this week as the lunar New Year approaches. The Malaysian National Farmer\\'s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR. While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales at $390/mt FOB as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales as low as $368/mt FOB in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.\\nDespite the weaker price environment, Saudi Arabia\\'s Ma\\'aden confirmed over 210,000 mt of sales for the coming two months. The shipments include DAP sales to India, Southeast Asia and East Africa, an MAP sale to Australia and mixed DAP/MAP shipments under formula pricing to Brazil and Argentina/Uruguay. Prices for the DAP sales are quoted in the $380-400/mt FOB range. Sabic is currently indicating prices in the $370s/mt FOB and has postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March due to slow demand.\\nMosaic\\'s Q1 cutback seems unlikely to change much in the near term. Global stocks remain high and demand has yet to jump in major markets. Sentiment has reduced significantly in recent weeks leading PhosAgro\\'s chief executive Andrey Guryev to say this week that DAP prices are likely to fall a further 10% in the next few weeks. Suppliers hope that the Mosaic cut, coupled with a return in demand for a range of markets at the end of Q1 can offset the recent price pressure.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Mosaic to cut DAP/MAP production by up to 400,000 mt in Q1\\n∙US Gulf Tampa DAP/MAP spot declines to $350-360/mt FOB\\n∙Brazil MAP spot price declines to $325-340/mt CFR on new sales\\n∙Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot declines to $340-410/mt FOB\\n∙Ma\\'aden makes over 210,000 mt DAP/MAP sales for Feb/March\\n∙Sabic postpones DAP/MAP availability to March\\n∙North Africa DAP spot declines to $400-430/mt FOB\\n∙China DAP spot declines to $368-378/mt FOB on SE Asia sales\\n∙GCT and JPMC expected to have around 100,000 mt DAP stocks\\n∙Fertinal confirms new Australia MAP sale, DAP/MAP price declines to $370/mt FOB\\n∙PhosAgro expects further 10% decline in DAP prices\\n∙JPMC confirms new phosphate rock contracts at reduced prices\\n∙New tenders: BCIC for 10k Phosacid and Kenya for 68k NPK\\nSulphur\\nThere were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq\\'s $30/mt reduction of its Qatar sulphur price to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its official selling price to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.\\nAmmonia\\nFurther falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the Tampa February number of $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.\\nAgricultural Developments\\nWheat prices moved lower this week, on reduced export demand, but offset by small gains in corn, soybean and rice prices.\\nSoybean harvest in Brazil has progressed beyond 4% completion, according to Ag Rural. Combine Harvesting in Mato Grosso was seen at 8% complete (11% same time last year). Reported yields have so far been mixed, and the USDA attaché in Brazil this week lowered their soybean production forecast to 98 million mt. This remains a record volume, but below the 100 million mt originally forecast.\\nSafrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20. This is due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This will help to boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.\\nCrop conditions in Argentina have turned dryer over the past two weeks. If this dry period is extended, yields of both soybeans and corn may be impacted, as both crops are in critical development stages.\\nRice prices in Thailand increased to a six month high this week. Low water availabilities added some worries to the upcoming cropping season and may be detrimental to fertilizer demand.\\nWheat planting in India inched higher through the week, with planted area now 29.3 million hectares, 5% below the same time last year.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest\\nDAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week\\'s postings.\\nUS Tampa: No new exports again\\nMosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil\\'s market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.\\nThis week\\'s drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.\\nUS NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut\\nAt the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.\\nOn average, this week\\'s DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.\\nMeanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.\\nUSA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts\\nMosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.\\nMosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.\\nSome traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.\\nNevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.\\nUS Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices\\nModest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.\\nOver the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal\\nFertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.\\nThe company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.\\nFertinal\\'s current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015\\nMexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.\\nMAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.\\nTSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.\\nIn December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: DAP/MAP imports up 7% Jan-Nov\\nColombia imported 303,832 mt DAP/MAP between January and November 2015, a 7% increase on the same period 2014, according to GTIS.\\nBetween January and November, Colombia imported 160,120 mt DAP, 12% more than the same period a year earlier. During the 11 months, Colombia imported 134,827 mt from the US, 7% higher than the 125,900 mt in 2014, while Chinese producers increased import volumes to 19,075 mt from 9,281 mt.\\nColombia\\'s MAP imports reached 143,172 mt, a slight increase from 140,541 mt in the same period a year ago. US shipments fell to 123,571 mt from 127,983 mt, while imports from China rose to 16,938 mt from just 8,073 mt in 2014.\\nBrazil: Indagro sells MAP at $325/mt CFR\\nIndagro is rumoured to have sold a further 5,000 mt Saudi MAP to Fertipar at the reduced price of $325/mt CFR.\\nThe news follows sales late last week from Indagro with Saudi MAP in the $330s/mt CFR. As a result, the Brazilian market is now quoted in the $325-340/mt CFR range.\\nSome sources believe the sale clears all tonnage on Indagro\\'s recent formula vessel with Saudi Arabian product.\\nThis week, Ma\\'aden has confirmed a further DAP/MAP cargo to Brazil under formula pricing with February or March shipment.\\nRecent sales for Latin America to traders or distribution channels by OCP, Saudi producers and PhosAgro have hit the market in another demand glut and Brazilian MAP prices plummeted.\\nMany suspect that the reduced prices, along with recent news that new credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, should boost demand by the end of the month or into March, which should at least stabilise the current price fall\\nBrazil: Full year P2O5 consumption down 7.4%\\nBrazil\\'s consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to 4.4 million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014, according to ANDA data.\\nImports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, DAP imports fell to 395,000 mt from 739,000 mt, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt from 938,000 mt and SSP imports fell to 564,000 mt from 608,000 mt.\\nDespite the reduced consumption and imports, domestic production of some granular phosphate products increased. MAP production rose 4% to 654,000 mt while SSP production rose 3% to 910,000 mt. However, TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.\\nArgentina: DAP prices reduce on market prices\\nSources from Argentina indicate that the recent collapse in Brazilian MAP prices has in turn reduced the expectations for DAP prices to Latin America.\\nAs a result, the Argentina DAP spot price has been indicatively reduced to $360-370/mt CFR pending new deals.\\nMa\\'aden has confirmed a further 50,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo to Argentina/Uruguay under formula pricing with February or March shipment.\\nFollowing the recent change of leadership in Argentina, many sources at FLA Colombia were buoyant that Argentine fertilizer buying will recover over the coming years after declines under the previous leadership.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Prices decline further on new sales\\nEuroChem sold its 10,000 mt DAP remaining for February shipment from Lifosa to northern European markets.\\nLast DAP sales to Northern Europe are believed to have been around $410/mt FOB.\\nThere are expectations from some sources that northern European bids may have fallen to as low as $410- 415/mt FCA, but EuroChem is still holding its Lifosa DAP prices at around $410/mt FOB.\\nThe company is planning a turnaround at the Lifosa plant for around three weeks starting in March, which is likely to reduce normal DAP tonnage by 40-50,000 mt.\\nEuroChem is also believed to have sold a 40,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo from Kingisepp to the US or Latin America but prices are currently unconfirmed.\\nThe sale would leave EuroChem with around 20,000 mt DAP and 60,000 mt MAP remaining from Kingisepp for February shipment.\\nEuroChem had said it may seek to reduce DAP/MAP production if prices remain depressed in Brazil but the company has yet to make any extra production cuts.\\nLast week, PhosAgro sold a 24,000 mt DAP cargo to Turkey\\'s Igsas at $390/mt CFR with duty unpaid and likely 270 days credit.\\nBased on current market prices and the new sales the Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot price has declined to $340-410/mt FOB and the Baltic/Black Sea MAP price has fallen to $330-340/mt FOB.\\nRussia: PhosAgro CEO sees more falls in fert prices\\nThe current decline in fertilizer prices is likely to continue, likely driving some high-cost Chinese producers out of business, PhosAgro\\'s chief executive officer told REUTERS on February 4.\\nPrices for phosphate, potash and nitrogen fertilizers are likely to weaken by at least another 10% in the next few weeks, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Guryev said.\\nHigh stocks, weaker currencies, lower commodity prices and limited demand in a range of markets have dragged down fertilizer prices, but Guryev said a further fall may push out some Chinese producers, helping to ease those stocks and lift prices later in 2016.\\n\"Sometimes, it is quite positive for the market to drop one level down because that is the only way to find a lift which will take you up,\" Guryev said.\\nPrices for DAP may decline by 10% to $320/mt on an FOB basis but would likely recover to around $400/mt FOB later in the year, he added.\\nPhosAgro increased output by 1 million mt in the last two years to 6.8 million mt and plans to continue growing production.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: DAP market prices reduce slightly\\nDemand for DAP is still slow in Europe but prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. Sources indicate that European buying may build later in Q1.\\nEuroChem have sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets.\\nIn early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe.\\nDespite this, based on current global market DAP prices, the Moroccan spot DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB pending new sales.\\nGCT and JPMC are offering around $400-420/mt FOB to Europe in February, with GCT confirmed to have sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB.\\nSome sources note that new bids from European buyers have reduced to the $390-410/mt CFR range.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic postpones sales as prices fall\\nSabic postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March as demand remains weak across key markets.\\nSabic says its price ideas are now $370-380/mt FOB.\\nMa\\'aden have confirmed a range of shipments for the next two months totalling around 210,000 mt DAP/MAP.\\nThe company has confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with a likely netback of around $385/mt FOB RAK and a 15-20,000 mt DAP sale to East Africa at around $400/mt FOB RAK.\\nIn addition, Ma\\'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK.\\nThe company has two mixed DAP/MAP cargoes to Latin America (one shipment to Brazil and one to Argentina/Uruguay) at formula pricing totalling around 100,000 mt. Ma\\'aden also has signed a 40,000 mt shipment, likely MAP, to Australia also at formula pricing.\\nMa\\'aden has also signed government-to-government agreements with Bangladesh for granular phosphate shipments in 2016 and plans to start executing sales in the next 1-2 months.\\nDAP prices are currently assessed at $370-395/mt FOB from Saudi Arabian producers.\\nSaudi Arabian MAP has recently been sold in Brazil by Indagro in the $325-340/mt CFR range.\\nJordan: Sales still slow, indicative prices decline\\nThere are no confirmed new DAP sales from Jordan this week and with market prices falling dramatically, the Jordan export price has also dropped on an indicative basis.\\nThe country exported just 25,000 mt DAP of its 80,000 mt allocation for the combined months of December and January and is likely to now have around 100,000 mt DAP in stock.\\nJPMC plans to carry out a month-long turnaround at its operations in March.\\nWith indications that new European levels may have slipped below $420/mt CFR and following the news of a Russian cargo to Turkey at $390/mt CFR, the Jordan DAP export price has declined on an indicative basis to $400/mt FOB.\\nTunisia: Prices reduce on low demand, high stocks\\nGCT sold 3-4,000 mt DAP of its February allocation to Italy at around $420/mt FOB, but new offers to these markets are believed to now be around the $400/mt FOB level.\\nFollowing recent DAP sales from Russia to Turkey at $390-395/mt CFR, GCT may be offering as low at $380/mt FOB to the Turkish market, although this is not confirmed.\\nCurrently Tunisian prices are assessed in an indicative range of $400-420/mt FOB pending further deals.\\nGCT sold around 40,000 mt of its 60,000 mt DAP allocation in both December and January. The company is still believed to still be operating at around 60% of its 110,000 mt/month capacity and GCT\\'s DAP stocks are currently quoted at around 100,000 mt.\\nMorocco: DAP prices hit more pressure\\nOCP continues to hold DAP prices at $440-450/mt FOB to Europe without any new sales, but the current market has dropped significantly and Moroccan export prices have been decreased to an indicative $420- 430/mt FOB.\\nMorocco cut its allocation for Europe in January to 50,000 mt from an expectation of 80-100,000 mt after further price declines across the continent. The company is planning for another 80-100,000 mt DAP/MAP sales to Europe in February, but says it will reduce this level again if necessary.\\nThe company\\'s DAP FOB values have likely been boosted by sales to African markets. OCP is aiming for 200-250,000 mt DAP/NPK/NPS shipments to African markets in February, including at least one shipment to Ethiopia, and is looking to sell 25-30,000 mt DAP/NPK into its domestic market.\\nHowever, there are indications that European DAP prices have fallen to as low as $390-430/mt CFR and OCP may soon be forced to make sales at further-reduced levels. On the other hand, OCP\\'s strategy may help limit the current price declines before a possible demand return in some markets later in Q1.\\nOCP also plans to send a further DAP/MAP panamax to the US during February, but there are no February shipments planned to its distribution channel in Brazil without some improvement in consumption.\\nThe Moroccan MAP price has been lowered to $400/mt FOB, but with no recent sales in Europe and Latin American levels indicating a netback around $70/mt below this, the level is likely to decline further.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: No activity as Fauji begins production\\nFauji has now finished the two-week turnaround at its Port Qasim plant and returned to granular phosphate production.\\nThere are no new reported DAP imports to Pakistan. With higher than normal stocks and the possibility of reduced consumption in Q1, there are unlikely to be significant imports of DAP during the period.\\nBased on indications from India and recent prices from Pakistan, the DAP price has reduced to an indicative level of $395/mt CFR with further downward pressure.\\nIndia: Glut in demand reduces indicated prices\\nIndian DAP importers are struggling to sell on vast stocks and there is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced.\\nOne 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this week from a Chinese producer to Blue Deebaj, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR, although the price was not confirmed.\\nMa\\'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment.\\nTraders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380-395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.\\nMost companies are expecting the DAP subsidy to be cut in a range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt ($29-44). The government may also force producers/importers to reduce the maximum retail price along with the subsidy reduction.\\nMany companies have revised DAP MRP\\'s to INR 23,700-23,800/mt since January from INR 23,700- 24,000/mt in order to match with IFFCO\\'s recent price reduction to INR 23,700/mt.\\nAt current MRP levels and exchange rates, DAP importers are believed to have a breakeven level of around $365-375/mt CFR if the subsidy is cut in the range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt. If there is a significant reduction in the MRP as well, this level may reduce by as much as $15-25/mt.\\nDAP stocks remain at the very high level of 2-2.5 million mt and domestic DAP production levels are returning to normal levels after the recent reduction in phosacid prices. As a result, there are unlikely to be significant DAP imports until at least the end of Q1.\\nAlthough unconfirmed, a major domestic tender for 80,000 mt DAP in the Punjab region is believed to have received offers as much as $50/mt below the current import price assessment as suppliers and importers\\nattempt to clear stocks. As a result, current sentiment is that DAP import prices for India have to reduce further but that even massive price reductions are unlikely to spur on import activity for quite some time.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: FOB levels reduce as Golden Week approaches\\nNew sales from Hubei producers and falls in market DAP prices have reduced the current Chinese FOB levels ahead of next week\\'s New Year holidays.\\nChinese producers are believed to have secured sales to Southeast Asia this week. The Malaysian National Farmer\\'s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR.\\nMarket DAP prices in India are now indicatively assessed as low as the $380/mt CFR level with downward pressure and little buying activity expected during the first quarter.\\nAs a result, Chinese export DAP prices are assessed in the $368-$378/mt FOB range although many of the larger producers continue to hold levels at around $390/mt FOB and are focusing on the domestic market.\\nWhile larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales in a time of little demand in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.\\nThe domestic market for DAP remains slow and has now effectively stopped with all of the transport systems in use for mass migration during the Chinese New Year holidays.\\nDespite this, domestic prices remain stable on a price guarantee basis this week and most sources expect that the domestic market will see at least a month\\'s worth of strong buying activity after the New Year, keeping much of the Chinese DAP out of export markets until around April.\\nRegarding MAP, Chinese producers have managed to keep up some export sales to the ongoing seasonal buying in Australia but there are no new exports to Brazil. Chinese producers have no current plans to send to Brazil as current market prices are too low compared to their domestic market or the Australian sales.\\nThe domestic MAP market also remains largely inactive with many NPK plants already announcing that they have completed their sourcing of raw materials for upcoming production after the Chinese holidays. Activity should increase following the New Year.\\nAustralia: MAP prices quoted relatively high\\nIndications from the Australian MAP market imply that prices in the on-going buying season are currently at significantly better netbacks to suppliers than the weak levels seen in Brazil.\\nChina\\'s Wengfu and YTH are believed to still be sending MAP to their distribution channels in Australia and sources quote prices for MAP at around $390/mt CFR.\\nMexico\\'s Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The cargo is priced on a formula.\\nHigh competition is reportedly taking place for sales in Australia, with more Chinese producers recently achieving Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) recognition, adding to the number of companies accepted to export granular phosphates to Australia.\\nAs a result, other countries which export to Australia, such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia, are expected to have lost market share to Chinese producers during the season.\\nRegarding exports, there are no new sales reported from Australia\\'s Incitec Pivot but with new price ideas reducing across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, export DAP prices have reduced on an indicative basis to $370-380/mt FOB.\\nSoutheast Asia: Nafas gets DAP in $380s/mt CFR\\nThe Malaysian National Farmer’s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR.\\nThe DAP is believed to be of Chinese origin and is likely to be for prompt shipment, although this is not confirmed.\\nIt is unclear whether the 15,000 mt DAP asked for by a Thai buyer last week has been purchased. The buyer asked for $380/mt CFR. A Thai buyer recently purchased 10,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer at $388/mt CFR.\\nIn addition, Ma\\'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK or around $400/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Further details were not available at press time.\\nPhilippines: DAP/NPK imports rise on Philphos closure\\nThe Philippines imported 90,000 mt DAP between January and October 2015, an increase from 54,000 mt on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. The vast majority of the DAP came from Chinese producers.\\nThe country also imported 145,168 mt NPKs during the ten months of 2015, a decline of 8% from 159,124 mt previously. Of this volume, 47,404 mt NPKs were shipped from Vietnamese producers, 30,000 mt from Yara, 26,738 from Namhae.\\nImports of NP products also rose to 107,776 mt from 70,310 mt previously, including 104,838 mt from Chinese producers.\\nThe Philippines did not export any DAP/NPK/NPs in 2015.\\nPhilippines producer Philphos remains out of action after damage caused by Cyclone Haiyan in November 2013. According to Filipino news agency InterAksyon the plant\\'s machinery remains intact and its granulation plant is back in working condition, but Philphos is not believed to have purchased raw material for production at this point.\\nRecent news reports have suggested that Philphos has struggled to collect insurance for the damage and may have defaulted on some of its interest and principal payments since the supertyphoon.\\nNew Zealand: DAP and Rock imports decline\\nNew Zealand\\'s DAP imports during 2015 reached 238,000 mt, a 20% decline on 297,000 mt previously, according to GTIS.\\nChinese DAP shipments increased to 183,000 mt from 151,000 mt, increasing its market share to 77% from 51% in 2014.

According to ANDA, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt in full year 2015 from 938,000 mt previously while TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes\\nEgypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.\\nBoth projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.\\nThe El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.\\nAbout 3.1 million mt of rock is required and \"secured at preferential prices,\" according to the prospectus. The project \"will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government\".\\nProduction of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.\\nThe investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project\\'s sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.\\nIn November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals\\' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.\\nIt will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid (see FERTILIZER WEEK on January 16, 2015), with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export.

It is expected to complete negotiations by the end of February.\\nOther rock suppliers, including OCP and some Egyptian companies, have reduced their rock prices by around $10/mt depending on grade and Vale is widely expected to accept a similar reduction.\\nVale\\'s current price for its 66.5% BPL rock is around $90/mt FOB depending on the market.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Misr Phosphate expands mining with three sites\\nMisr Phosphate is now operating three phosphate rock mines in Egypt, and recently began work at a new site.\\nAlongside production estimated at about 2 million mt/year for Abu-Tartour, the government-owned entity began operations at El Sibiya site close to the Red Sea two months ago, with its first shipment due to load out of Safaga.\\nEl Sibiya produces 27-30% P2O5 rock, as well as 24-25% P2O5, Misr Phosphate said in Cairo.\\nThe company also resumed operations at the Red Sea Mine, which produces higher-grade 30-32% P2O5 ore. There are said to be 500 workers on site and production estimates vary from 15,000 mt a month currently to about 40,000 mt.\\nMisr Phosphate receives only a small percentage of revenue for managing operations at the Red Sea mine but hopes to be awarded outright control in the near future.\\nCombined production from the three mines is estimated by the company to reach about 3 million mt/year.\\nMisr Phosphate and El Nasr Mining are still considering price-coordination to establish a single FOB price for each grade of rock exported from Egypt. The idea is understood to be encountering resistance from traders.\\nJordan: Q1 rock contracts settle $10-13/mt lower\\nJordan\\'s JPMC has now settled most of its phosphate rock contracts with customers for the first quarter at a $10-13/mt decrease from prices in the second half of 2015, the producer said.\\nIn India, buyers of Jordan\\'s higher-grade rock (73-75% BPL) will pay about $120/mt FOB in Q1 with consumers in Indonesia and Japan paying as much as $125/mt FOB.\\nLower-grade rock for the Indian market (68-72% BPL) was settled at around $110/mt FOB, with buyers outside India paying around $115/mt FOB. JPMC is still believed to be negotiating some final deals with Indian customers.\\nAs a result of the new contracts and after recent news that OCP concluded its 72% BPL contract price at $130-140/mt FOB, the India (71-75% BPL) Spot/Contract price is now assessed at $126-152/mt CFR pending any further contracts.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Rock shipments pass 500,000 mt in January\\nPhosphate rock shipments to India reached 526,000 mt in January according to port data, bringing full fertilizer-year rock shipments to 6.9 million mt.\\nFor February, the country already has 238,000 mt rock set for delivery, port data show. The February tonnage includes two shipments from OCP totalling 107,000 mt, two shipments from JPMC totalling 88,000 mt and one shipment of 44,000 mt from Algeria.\\nNP/NPKS\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: UralChem\\'s NPK production increases\\nUralchem produced 617,000 mt of complex fertilizers in 2015, exceeding its 2014 levels by 18%.\\nTotal fertilizer production increased by 4% during the year, to 5.9 million mt, 84% of its production was nitrogen products, the company said in a press statement.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nKenya: KTDA seeks 67,587 mt NPKs for 2016\\nThe Kenya Tea Development Agency is seeking 67,587 mt NPK 26-5-5 for 2016 and is pre-qualifying suppliers as part of a two-phase tender process, according to the agency\\'s website.\\nCompanies seeking prequalification must submit technical proposals by February 23, 2016.\\nKTDA last April bought 70,000 mt Uralchem product from Mekatrade at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.\\nNEWS\\nENERGY/GAS\\nOCP aims for energy independence by 2020\\nMoroccan phosphates giant OCP plans to boost investments in renewable energy as it looks to achieve energy independence by 2020, according to news agency SEENEWS.\\nThe company is targeting a generation capacity of 600 megawatts by 2020 by investments in wind, solar and hydro energy along with cogeneration, the Moroccan Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said at a mining conference last week.\\nSince 2010, OCP has raised co-generation capacity to 350 megawatts, which covered 60% of their electricity needs in 2015.\\nThe news comes as King Mohammed VI inaugurated the company\\'s JPH-1 fertilizer production hub, which is dedicated to African markets. Production at the site started at the end of 2015.\\nThe plant is part of OCP\\'s ambitious strategy to increase fertilizer production to 12 million mt by 2017 with a second hub set to come online by the end of Q2 2016.\\nLEGISLATION\\nBrazil receives early farm credit boost\\nThe Brazilian government, in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil), have announced that BRL 10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, according to consultancy \\'The Soybean and Corn Advisor\\'.\\nThis early announcement of credit follows complaints in 2015, when credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand.\\nSmall to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Programme to Help Medium-Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). Loans for BRL 710,000 ($180,000) have an interest rate of 7.75% and loans of BRL 1,200,000 ($304,350) see a rate of 8.75%. These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nPemex finalises Fertinal takeover\\nPemex has completed its acquisition of Fertinal in Mexico, with longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Fabio Covarrubias of the phosphate producer confirming he has handed over control this week.\\nIn a letter to Fertinal employees, Covarrubias said government controlled petrochemical giant Pemex was in a position to make the phosphate operation on Mexico’s west coast more vertically integrated thanks to Pemex’s ammonia capacity. This in turn should move Fertinal back into the list of low-cost phosphate\\nproducers, he said.\\nThe takeover will cost Pemex around $680-690 million, according to Mexican media reports.\\nThe sale of Fertinal has been a subject of industry speculation for much of the last two decades. Ultimately this deal may prove to be more of a signal about Pemex\\'s intentions for its nitrogen assets than anything else.\\nPemex controls Petroquimica Cosoleacaque, with nearly 900,000 mt ammonia capacity on Mexico\\'s east coast, although the units do not run at capacity. The lack of competitive ammonia freight to Mexico\\'s west coast versus competing supplies from Trinidad and Venezuela mean the Pemex subsidiaries are not in a position to routinely supply Fertinal.\\nHowever, now that Pemex owns Fertinal it should be be easier to arbitrage deliveries to the west coast, as a way to reduce costs of delivering ammonia to the DAP, MAP and TSP producer.\\nPRODUCTION\\nPhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%\\nRussian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.\\nDespite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.\\nPhosAgro\\'s DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.\\nSeparately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.\\nRegarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.\\nOverall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.\\nDespite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.\\nRegarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro\\'s new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.\\nHowever, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Although the price falls within the low end of last week\\'s range, other indications suggest that some pressure still remains as the tender season winds down.\\nVietnamese MOP prices continue to hold at the upper end of the range at $295/mt CFR although this could change in the coming weeks with Vietnam’s application season nearing. If demand in the country increases, some suppliers may attempt to push for higher prices, increasing the width of the region’s assessed range.\\nSome major global suppliers were hoping to talk business with Brazilian importers at last week’s FLA conference in Cartagena, Colombia but those meetings did not take place. Indications are that the price in Brazil is stable this week but confirmed deals in the $230s/mt CFR could be seen within the month if demand does not accelerate, as some traders expect it to do between now and March.\\nIndian importers are now expecting potash subsidy rate cuts of $22-29/mt, which would further add to their arguments for a significantly decreased 2016 contract price. According to sources, many traders are anticipating it to be agreed at between $240-270/mt CFR. Given the country’s 1.6-1.8 million mt inventory level, this would not be surprising and negotiations could be noticeably delayed, following as similar trend to those in China.\\nIn China, the port wholesale price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200/mt FCA in the lead up to New Year festivities. Once contract talks begin, likely at the end of February, negotiations will be slow because the country does not need to bring in any foreign tonnes over the next couple months.\\nUS potash values held relatively steady with only a modest decline reported at New Orleans for imported barges. In the Midwest, modest movement from distributors to retailers and to the fields continued this week thanks to hard ground. These pre-spring applications of potash (and phosphates) are typical this time of year. This suggests Q1 demand in the key US corn and soybean growing region of the Midwest will be in line with prior years.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Japan December MOP imports down 51% y-o-y\\n∙Malaysia MOP price sees $5/mt decrease\\n∙Brazil January through September imports down 8% y-o-y\\n∙US NOLA barge prices assessed lower\\n∙Indian importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts\\n∙Colombia November MOP imports up 44% y-o-y\\n∙Mexico November MOP imports down 72% y-o-y\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the\\nspread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barge offers drift lower\\nImported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week\\'s range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.\\nMexico: November MOP imports down 72%\\nMexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.\\nOf this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.\\nThe month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more than in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.\\nSQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.\\nUS Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings\\nNew granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: November MOP imports up 44%\\nColombia imported 50,657 mt of MOP in November, a 44% increase from the same month in 2014, according to the latest GTIS data.\\nK+S shipped 28,829 mt to the Latin American country in November, up from 4,885 mt in November 2014. The remainder of the tonnes were shipped by Uralkali (12,760 mt) and Canpotex (7,061 mt).\\nJanuary through November, Colombia imported 516,087 mt MOP, a 13% increase from the same period in 2014. Uralkali, the country’s largest supplier, shipped 234,584 mt during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 169,617 mt in 2014.\\nColombia also imported 175,464 mt from Canpotex and 76,107 mt from K+S, with the former decreasing shipments by 5% and the latter increasing shipments by 69% from the same period of the previous year.\\nBrazil: Jan-Dec MOP imports down 8% y-o-y\\nBrazil imported 292,489 mt of MOP in December, down from the 657,396 mt it received in the same month of 2014, according to Anda data.\\nCanpotex was the country’s largest supplier with a market share of 35% for the month. BPC supplied 25% of the imported product, while 14% came from Uralkali and 13% from K+S, according to GTIS data.\\nIn the full year of 2015, Brazil imported 8.3 million mt MOP, a decrease of 8% compared to the 12 months of 2014. Of this, 34% of the tonnes were imported via Canpotex.\\nOther January through December shipment shares were held by BPC (20%), Uralkali (17%) and K+S (15%). Brazil imported the remainder of the full-year volumes from ICL and SQM, a total market share of around 12%.\\nPotash consumption in Brazil was up slightly in December compared to the same month of 2014. It totalled 327,501 mt, a year-on-year increase of 4%, according to Anda. However, consumption in the full year of 2015 was 5.2 million mt, down 4% from the 12 months of 2014.\\nBrazil’s MOP production in December was 28,113 mt, a minor decrease on the December 2014 level of 29,147 mt. The country therefore produced 279,138 mt in the full year of 2015, down just over 2% from 2014.\\nSome major potash suppliers were hoping to conduct business with Brazilian importers at last week’s conference in Cartagena but this did not happen. There are now expectations that demand, and subsequently trading, will increase in March.\\nThe business price range in Brazil remains $240- 250/mt CFR and demand is still weak, sources say. There has been a lack of indications to suggest that prices in the $230s/mt CFR deserve to form part of the range, despite previous suggestions of deals at $235/mt CFR.\\nOn a positive note, some sources have said that farmers are starting to make more money off of their trading, which could contribute towards increased demand later on in Q1. Producers are also reportedly attempting to work with partners in the country who are not bankrupt in an attempt to make more regular agreements.\\nThe Brazil granular bulk MOP spot price is assessed stable at $240-250/mt CFR.\\nEUROPE\\nSoutheast Asia: Slight price drop following pressure\\nThe assessed range for the Southeast Asia MOP spot price has been lowered to $255-295/mt CFR following reports of continued market pressure last week.\\nPrices across the region were said to be stable with the exception of Malaysia, where indications ranged from $250-260/mt CFR. According to one seller, business can be seen at as low as $250/mt CFR although there are no confirmed deals below this low end.\\nOne major supplier confirmed a February vessel bound for Malaysia with 30,000 mt standard MOP at a price of around $260/mt CFR. There are no confirmed tenders to report in the region as the season nears its end but there could be two more that have yet to be announced, sources say.\\nIndonesian prices are still higher than in Malaysia at around $270-280/mt CFR based on most indications but there are no new deals to report.\\nIn Vietnam, the high end of the current range has reportedly been maintained by suppliers despite previous suggestions that it would slip. Shipments are expected to start arriving in February, in line with the application season. Standard MOP is still seen at around $295/mt CFR, with granular priced at around $315/mt CFR, according to sources.\\nEurope: Demand remains weak as buying season looms\\nThe granular MOP buying season in northwest Europe is expected to start in the next few weeks although farmers in the region remain relatively inactive for now, according to sources.\\nRecent rainfall in the Benelux countries has not helped the current lack of business as farmers have not been using fertilizers. Potash demand remains low, partially because farmers are in no rush to consider application.\\nThere could be a slight rise in granular MOP prices once demand increases but this is not likely to happen until the buying season begins, sources say.\\nAt the beginning of January, some product was flowing freely because it was ready to be transported. However, warehouses then filled, resulting in pressure on prices as producers described the need to try to move tonnes. It now appears as though previous discounted offers have failed to spur demand.\\nThe northwest Europe granular MOP market is assessed unchanged again this week at €280-290/mt CIF with no new confirmed business to report.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSouth Africa: December MOP imports down 41%\\nSouth Africa imported 40,263 mt of MOP in December, 41% less than it did in the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nChile’s SQM supplied 31,401 mt of this, 23% more than in November 2014. The lower monthly import volume can be attributed to decreased K+S shipments, which totalled 8,796 mt in November compared to 20,500 mt in November 2014.\\nIn the full year of 2015, South Africa imported 377,367 mt of MOP, a meagre 1% drop from 2014 volumes. Of this, SQM shipped 135,362 mt, an increase of just 1,000 mt compared to 2014.\\nOther shipments throughout the 12 months were received from APC (90,800 mt), K+S (86,622 mt), Uralkali (41,950 mt) and ICL (17,566 mt).\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts\\nPotash importers in India are now expecting 2016-17 subsidy rate cuts of INR 1,500-2,000 ($22-29)/mt, according to sources.\\nThis, combined with potential discounts on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) in the country, may result in low breakeven prices for importers, given current ideas that the 2016 contract will be agreed at somewhere between $240-270/mt CFR.\\nIf subsidy rates are cut by $22-29/mt, importers’ breakeven would be around $225-230/mt CFR, taking MRP decreases and a US dollar to INR ratio of 1:68 into account.\\nAlternatively, if the subsidy rates were cut by the same range and there was a further INR 1,000 ($15)/mt decrease on the MRP of INR 16,000 ($237)/mt CFR, then importers would have a breakeven of as low as $215-225/mt CFR after considering capital requirements for four to six months due to the high inventory level.\\nGiven how low these potential breakeven prices are next to the expected range of the new contract, importers would likely try to maintain margins through reducing MOP discounts.\\nPotash inventories were estimated to be 1.6-1.8 million mt as of the end of January. As a result, most suppliers are continuing to offer heavy discounts in the range of INR 2,500-3,000 ($37-45)/mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Lunar New Year approach slows activity\\nThe Chinese MOP port wholesale spot price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200 ($301-335)/mt FCA as the country’s residents prepare for New Year festivities.\\nIt has become increasingly evident that negotiations over the new contract price will be difficult this year. They are expected to start at the end of February.\\nLarge suppliers across the global markets are waiting for the benchmark that the new contract will establish, but there will be little news to report on this front over the couple weeks.\\nIn the full year 2015, China imported more than 9 million mt of MOP for the first time since 2007. Much of this tonnage will need to be sold on before a formal agreement to bring in regular shipments over the next year is agreed.\\nJapan: Dec MOP imports down 51% y-o-y\\nJapan imported 19,150 mt of MOP in December, a decrease of 51% from the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nOf this amount, 8,239 mt were received from BPC, which increased its monthly market share to 43% from just 6% in 2014. Uralkali shipped 5,509 mt, up from 2,805 mt, while Canpotex decreased its shipments to just 1,536 mt from 16,174 mt in December 2014.\\nThe December tonnes bring Japan’s full year 2015 import volume to 494,113 mt, down from 534,365 mt in the full year of 2014. Canpotex remained the country’s largest supplier despite decreasing its shipments by 11% year on year to 346,959 mt.\\nOther full year 2015 imported volumes were from Uralkali (43,065 mt), BPC (40,761 mt) and K+S (27,546 mt).\\nPhilippines: October MOP imports more than triple\\nThe Philippines imported 16,081 mt of MOP in October 2015, according to the latest customs data via GTIS. The amount is up from 5,853 mt in October 2014.\\nCanpotex, the largest Phillippines\\' largest supplier, shipped 12,027 mt in October, a 75% increase from the same month of the previous year.\\nBetween January and October, the Philippines imported 129,095 mt of MOP, up from 106,739 mt from the same period in 2014. Of this, 61,724 mt arrived via Canpotex.\\nNEWS\\nENVIRONMENT\\nK+S cuts saline waste production by 50%\\nK+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.\\nThe potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to reduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.\\n“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer Gerling said.\\nFurther measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.\\nIn December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though\\nthe authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.\\nLogan Collins, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2020\\nEmail: logan.collins@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Many traders had already left on holiday, and the outlook for prices following the Spring Festival holidays will depend largely on how much product sellers push onto the market, as buyers in China are likely to need some tonnes for the domestic fertilizer season.\\nSome in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR. Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels. India’s November 2015 imports increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.\\nMeanwhile, the announcement of production cuts at Mosaic’s US phosphate operations provided another bearish demand signal.\\nIn contract news, Russian suppliers and Morocco’s OCP failed to reach a consensus and will therefore not settle Q1 contracts. Morocco’s other contracts settled so far have been reported ranging from the low $90s/mt to the mid-$110s/mt CFR, while Russia’s other contracts with North Africa were reportedly in the upper $110s/mt CFR.\\nRussia’s November 2015 exports plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.\\nFurther European Q1 contracts were reported settled at decreases of $5/mt, though in some cases buyers continued to push for greater declines.\\nIn other trade news, Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Chinese prices drop further\\n∙China\\'s imports climb 17% in 2015\\n∙Indian buyers steering clear of spot\\n∙Reliance closes latest tender\\n∙Some Brazil Q1 settlements at $110-115/mt CFR\\n∙Med prices also down\\n∙Some European Q1 settlements down $5/mt from Q4\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply\\nMosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced phosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.\\nCorrection: Last week\\'s edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nKazakhstan: Exports down 21% for 2015\\nKazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.\\nChina was the main outlet for Kazakh tonnes in 2015, taking 1.34 million mt of exports, 13% less than in 2014.\\nChina remained a key outlet in December, taking 77,384 mt of the December exports.\\nIn December, Kazakhstan also sent 30,794 mt to Brazil, 18,000 mt to Benin, 16,000 mt to Lebanon, 11,991 mt to Lithuania, and 9,612 to Ukraine.\\nKazakhstan had been increasing export volumes in recent years as the sulphur stockpile at Tengiz was drawn down. TengizChevroil’s stockpile was fully depleted in H1 2015, with export volumes decreasing in H2 2015.\\nRussia: November exports down 42% on year\\nRussia’s November 2015 exports of sulphur plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.\\nThe largest taker of November volumes was\\nMorocco, with 46,271 mt. Other key outlets were\\nChina (25,746 mt), Israel (20,186 mt), and\\nArgentina (14,038 mt).\\nRussia’s volumes to most of its key destinations declined in 2015 to November, although exports to Lithuania more than tripled to 198,189 mt and exports to Israel increased 40% to 115,068 mt.\\nExports to the US reached 59,689 mt compared with only 10,998 mt over the same period in 2014 as the country increased its intake of solid sulphur.\\nRussia: Q1 contracts settled but no Morocco\\nSuppliers of Russian sulphur said they had settled Q1 contracts with North African buyers aside from OCP.\\nSettlements were reportedly in the high $110s/mt CFR.\\nRussian suppliers will skip Q1 contracts with Morocco.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Further Q1 contracts settled at minus $5/mt\\nEuropean Q1 contracts for sulphur appeared to be near full settlement, with further settlements confirmed at $5/mt decreases from Q4.\\nSome buyers are pushing for greater decreases in the wake of the recent decline in the US contract price as well as falling prices elsewhere around the world.\\nEuropean sellers had originally offered a rollover in December, but had since decreased this to minus $5/mt.\\nAs downstream markets struggle, European sulphur buyers argue that they need to have similar raw material price decreases to their international counterparts in order to remain competitive. The US settlement at a decrease of $15/lt therefore provided extra impetus for a decrease.\\nBut sellers have argued that the European liquid market itself is relatively balanced, with little basis for large price decreases.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSouth Africa: Imports drop by a third in 2015\\nSouth Africa’s 2015 imports of sulphur were 33% lower than 2014 at 421,992 mt.\\nTonnes mainly came from Saudi Arabia (35%), Kuwait (25%), Qatar (19%), and Canada (17%).\\nDecember imports were a mere 243 mt.\\nFoskor\\'s phosphate plant has suffered a series of technical issues and labour disputes, and continues to have issues with power shortages, all contributing towards a lower operating rate and reduced sulphur imports.\\nIt is worth noting, however, that some of the imports would likely have been for re-export to neighbouring Zambia, where South Africa sent 171,234 mt in 2015, 25% less than in 2014.\\nNorth Africa: Q1 sulphur contracts mostly concluded\\nNorth African Q1 contracts for sulphur supply are mostly settled, though some negotiations continued.\\nContract settlements have been reported in a wide range from the low $90s/mt CFR to the upper $110s/mt CFR.\\nMeanwhile, Morocco’s OCP is not expected to settle Q1 contracts with Russian suppliers, as the two sides were unable to reach a consensus.\\nOn the spot market, one source suggested that producer was being offered below $90/mt CFR, but this was not confirmed by sellers or traders.\\nMiddle East: Spot assessed lower but business limited\\nMiddle East spot prices were assessed lower based on sellers’ official postings as well as falling bids and prices around the world.\\nHowever, spot availability from Middle East sellers is reportedly lacking until the end of February, with sellers focusing on contractual business.\\nThe lower end of the range is in line with Tasweeq’s February QSP of $89/mt FOB, while the upper end is in line with Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB. However, the upper end of this range is unlikely to be achievable on sales to any region in the current market, although most deem the lower end lower than is necessary to achieve sales.\\nUAE: Adnoc posts $105/mt FOB OSP for February\\nAdnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $105/mt FOB Ruwais for February, down $17/mt from its January level, according to market sources.\\nThis represents a delivered price to India in the low-to-mid $110s/mt CFR.\\nIt follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its December level. Aramco posted its February price mid-January at $115/mt FOB Jubail, down $13/mt from its January price.\\nQatar: Tasweeq cuts QSP to $89/mt FOB for February\\nTasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its January number.\\nThis marks the biggest drop in the QSP since April 2014. It is well below Aramco Trading\\'s official February price of $115/mt FOB, which the producer posted in mid-January.\\nPrices have been under considerable pressure as a result of weak downstream fertilizer markets as well as increased global supply.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Assessment down but business lacking\\nIndian spot prices were assessed down at $110-120/mt CFR following global price falls, but firm indications and business were lacking.\\nSome in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR.\\nDemand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels.\\nMeanwhile, most sources were under the impression that Reliance’s 25,000 mt sulphur sales tender, which closed January 28, was in fact scrapped, though this was not confirmed.\\nIndia: Imports up in November but down for 11 months\\nIndia’s November 2015 imports of sulphur increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.\\nQatar supplied the majority of the November tonnes as the source of 45,374 mt.\\nOther sources of tonnes in November included\\nKuwait (27,483 mt) and Bahrain (12,607 mt).\\nQatar and Saudi Arabia were the main sources of Indian sulphur imports over the first 11 months of the year, with market shares of 34% and 28% respectively.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Price falls across the board but spot dead\\nPrice decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur.\\nFor international business, sources suggested conclusions around $100/mt CFR for granular product, but nothing was confirmed at this level. Some buyers were reportedly bidding around $90-95/mt CFR, and there were unconfirmed reports of offers at $100/mt CFR. Some argued that the lack of spot business meant that the real price level was $110-115/mt CFR, the upper end of which was in line with Adnoc\\'s OSP of $105/mt FOB, though well below Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB.\\nSources mostly reported crushed and molten sulphur in the $90s/mt CFR. There was a third-party report of a granular deal at $85/mt CFR as well as a molten deal at $88/mt CFR for March shipment.\\nSome importers questioned whether they would be able to obtain product at Tasweeq’s QSP of $89/mt FOB, with many believing that the low level was offered as an opportunity for the producer’s offtakers to make up for negative margins in previous months.\\nThere was limited activity at all major ports, as many traders had already started taking holidays. At Nantong and Zhenjiang, granular product was offered around RMB 850-860/mt FCA, with prices at similar levels even at Qingdao, where quotes tend to be higher.\\nPort inventories climbed to around 1.44 million mt with traders on holiday while many consumers stopped moving product to plants from late January. Inventories may rise as high as 1.6-1.7 million mt by the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.\\nDomestic prices also fell further. Sinopec’s Puguang reduced its prices twice within three days, with its price at Wenzhou port down to RMB 880/mt FCA from RMB 930/mt last week and plant prices down to RMB 870/mt EXW from RMB 900/mt. The producer needs to clear as much stock as possible because of the Chinese holidays. Its inventories were around 25,000 mt at port and 60-70,000 mt at plant including granular and molten volumes.\\nOther refineries also lowered prices by up to RMB 70/mt.\\nPhosphate companies argue that sulphur prices should fall further because of downstream weakness. As these buyers will be producing at relatively high rates following the holidays for the domestic Spring season, they will need some sulphur. Price movement will therefore be highly influenced by how many tonnes sellers attempt to push into the market.\\nJapan: December exports down a third\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nThe Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.\\nExports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.\\nVolumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.\\nMost of the remaining volumes went to\\nSoutheast Asia, Taiwan and Australia.\\nThe Philippines was the key destination for Japanese exports in the month of December, taking 109,994 mt.\\nOther export destinations included India (18,098\\nmt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

This is being helped by the lack of spot sales, for now at least, from Mexico to the likes of Brazil and Morocco.\\nMexico’s exports for the first 11 months 2015 were 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014 as the Boleo mine was running producing acid with minimal internal use. For 2016 it is believed that most if not all of Boleo’s volumes have been committed to Chile.\\nAlthough Morocco’s OCP remains out of the spot market, this is at least partially because of the large volume of pre-booked tonnes the buyer has arriving in Q1, which may have also left European producers more comfortable in the immediate term.\\nSpot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were therefore assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.\\nMarket participants were more negative about Asian regions, with many pegging prices lower than the current assessment of $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and/or expecting price falls in the near future, as spot availability in the region is expected to increase.\\nSpot prices to India were assessed unchanged, but the country offered no spot demand as buyers were comfortable. The country has been a key outlet for Asian exports, and its November imports increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.\\nPressure will increase on prices in Asia if the PASAR smelter in the Philippines successfully ramps up following technical issues in the wake of its restart. Exports from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Further sources peg Brazil in $40s/mt CFR\\n∙Mexico exports to November up 75%\\n∙OCP out of spot as large volume pre-booked\\n∙Asian and European FOB steady for now\\n∙Indian demand weak\\n∙India imports to November up 66%\\n∙Japan 2015 exports down 4%\\nBase Metals\\nBase metal prices finally showed signs of stabilisation and recovery, with increases across the board driven by a weaker dollar as expectations of a further base rate hike by the Federal Reserve diminished. Indeed, copper and aluminium reached one-month highs while lead and zinc achieved their highest levels in four months. LME copper was up to $4,578/mt.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nSome questions remain regarding Mosaic\\'s liquid sulphur needs and sulphuric acid production during Q1. The producer\\'s Q1 sulphur agreement is assumed to have included an adjustment to its contracted volumes to account for its reduced need to make acid. However, since Mosaic has committed only to cutting \"up to\" 400,000 mt of finished phosphates the possibility remains of the producer either carrying over acid into Q2 or potentially selling spot acid in Q1.\\nThere were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq\\'s $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Spot market quiet on limited demand\\nThe US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving.\\nSome argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand.\\nMeanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.\\nMexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt\\nMexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.\\nThe US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.\\nMexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.\\nFor January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.\\nThe increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.\\nCRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.\\nIn recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.\\nConversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: FOB steady as sellers comfortable\\nSpot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.\\nAlthough some sources have suggested lower prices, particularly based on volumes previously agreed for sale to North Africa, most believe that negative FOB spot business is unlikely for now.\\nSources suggest that contractual offtake remains relatively firm, while the large volumes scheduled for Q1 arrival to Morocco also leave sellers more comfortable.\\nWith recent Brazilian business reportedly in the $40s/mt CFR, the current European FOB range seems reflective.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP out of spot as large volumes pre-booked\\nOCP is understood to still be out of the sulphuric acid spot market, and is likely to remain so for the remainder of February.\\nMorocco has a large volume scheduled to arrive in Q1, and given the weakness in downstream fertilizer markets and falling sulphur prices, there will be little incentive for OCP to seek additional tonnes on a spot basis. The buyer reportedly has several vessels waiting at ports.\\nSources are now waiting to see what OCP’s likely requirement will be for Q2.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand lacking as buyers comfortable\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid imports into India were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt CFR, though spot business is scarce.\\nOne source said they have heard business in the $30s/mt CFR, but such levels would likely be difficult to achieve at this stage.\\nBuyers were pushing for numbers as low as the upper $10s/mt CFR, but were comfortable on stock levels with no strong demand.\\nMeanwhile, traders said that CIL has actively started discussing contract prices for 2016 for balance quantities, but there was no confirmation.\\nIndia: November imports jump 72%\\nIndia’s November 2015 imports of sulphuric acid increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.\\nThe vast majority of the November tonnes came from South Korea, while 18,643 mt came from Spain. This marked the first time India has imported sulphuric acid from Spain.\\nJapan and South Korea were the main sources of Indian acid imports over the year to November, supplying 503,750 mt and 479,667 mt respectively.\\nImports from China increased to 119,652 mt from nothing in previous years, while those from the Philippines climbed 15% to 66,791 mt. Imports from North Korea also increased from nothing to 45,590 mt.\\nBrazil: Prices in $40s/mt CFR limit negativity\\nSources suggested that the recent tenders from Yara and Mosaic were awarded in the $40s/mt CFR, though details were not confirmed.\\nPrices were pegged as high as the mid-to-high $40s/mt CFR, but the upper $40s/mt CFR would suggest increasing prices, which seems unlikely given price movements in broader markets.\\nThe Yara requirement is reportedly being met by tonnes from Peru.\\nYara’s tender for 18,000 mt for delivery early March closed January 15, while Mosaic was heard to be seeking 12,000 mt a week later.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Domestic prices stabilise as stocks cleared\\nAcid prices in China were relatively stable over the course of the week, as destocking was mostly completed.\\nRecent production cuts by sulphur burners and pyrite plants have also been supportive.\\nMany smelters prices are now less than RMB 100/mt EXW and may be negative after March. This is down from RMB 150-300/mt in H1 2015, and it is likely that smelters may be at negative prices within Q1.\\nImport prices were pegged from the high $10s/mt to the low $20s/mt CFR.\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot unchanged; falls expected\\nSpot prices for East Asian exports of sulphuric acid remained assessed at $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea given a lack of new business and indications.\\nSources have suggested levels at either end of this price range, though more believed that lower prices were likely, most prevalently minus $5/mt to $5/mt FOB. Indeed, some sources believe that Asian prices will decline further over coming weeks as availability eases. For now though, firm spot indications were scarce.\\nJapan: Exports inch down 4% for 2015\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nThe Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.\\nExports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.\\nVolumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.\\nMost of the remaining volumes went to Southeast\\nAsia, Taiwan and Australia.\\nThe Philippines was as usual the outlet for largest share of Japanese exports in December, taking 109,994 mt.\\nOther export destinations included India (18,098 mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.\\nPhilippines: No acid exports in October\\nExports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.\\nIndonesia was the main destination, receiving 64,900 mt from January through October.\\nThe remainder has gone to Malaysia, Australia and\\nIndia also received product.\\nThe country resumed exports in August and\\nSeptember, having not exported any acid over the\\nMay-July period.\\nIn recent years, exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as the PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan.\\nThe smelter shut April 16, 2015 for maintenance and work to increase capacity. The sulphuric acid capacity was 500,000 mt/year and work at the site\\nwas intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until at least mid-2016.\\nAlthough the plant has sold some tonnes since its restart, it has also reportedly had some delays ramping up, and the current and future production of the smelter remains one of the key uncertainties in global acid markets.\\nThe Philippines’ October 2015 imports increased to 95,878 mt, up from only 2,114 mt in October 2014. However, total imports for the first 10 months were still down 13% at 375,205 mt.\\nAlmost all of the imports have come from Japan, although Taiwan was the source of 8,444 mt, the majority of which (6,037 mt) was imported in June 2015.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

VAT at 13% is incorporated from September for both\\nANALYSIS\\nUndertone firmer on prospects of pent-up demand\\nA firmer undertone was evident in global urea markets as the first week of February progressed, albeit after some downward adjustments from select sources. The January slide in prices from all origins has halted, and some improvements were registered in delivered values, which in turn prompted more buyers to reappear for coverage.\\nPriced substantially above other sources, Egyptian producers did concede a discount of around\\n$9/mt on deals concluded at $224/mt FOB last week, but producers are since claiming to have recaptured the lost ground. Outages in Egypt on a ruptured pipeline were initially expected to fuel substantial price- increases, but a rapid return to normality will likely limit prospects for significant improvement in the short term.\\nEuropean values also lost some ground based on sales concluded last week from the Middle East and poorer returns on US sales to regional producers at that time, but the reversal in the US pricing has since provided better netbacks and boosted expectations for further gains.\\nThe US has been and remains the key market in supporting a change in direction so far. Prompt granular urea barge values at New Orleans gained $17/st from the start of the week to the end, although the average week over week rose only $1/st. However, forward physical sales for late February and March reached\\n$208/st FOB. Overall US traders were marginally bullish on granular urea heading into next week\\'s annual TFI Business Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\\nMore optimism has also spilled over to FSU supply of granular urea. After failing to achive interest much above $190/mt FOB in prior sessions, GrodnoAzot opted to reject bids more than $10/mt higher in its February 1 tender, and is aiming for more when retendering February 5 for the sale of 20,000 mt.\\nBrazilian prices for granular urea have improved on the back of firmer US sentiment, and suppliers are optimimistic that relatively inexpensive credit available to small and mid-sized farms will combine with significantly higher corn prices in the domestic market to stimulate forward offtake and imports of urea.\\nOther importers in the Americas also appear to have sensed that urea values may be closer to a floor, and have emerged with requirements for prompt and forward positions of prilled and granular urea. Prices are being tested this week for both grades in Mexico, while buying interest also reappeared for granular imports from Canada.\\nMarkets and supply-sources in Asia have been relatively quiet leading up to celebrations and holidays for lunar New Year, but buyers needing to cover short positions for prompt loading did have to concede higher costs to secure cover.\\nWhile too early to predict a major surge in prices, traders that shorted prills and granular urea at netbacks some $20/mt below current values appear unlikely to secure cover at a margin on positions that need to load by March, and some positions could well result in substantial losses.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙US NOLA prompt and forward prices gained all week, and\\n∙Inland distributors can support $5-10/st higher barge costs even without raising inland prices\\n∙Brazilian buyers face higher offers, accordingly, and are left with few options but to accept\\n∙Middle East netbacks up on US and Brazilian improvements and spot sales\\n∙Egyptian prices adjust lower via sale of 20,000 mt for prompt loading\\n∙Baltic prices surge as traders cover in, and prior short sales look scary\\n∙Black Sea values stable to firm and traders unwilling to add aggressive shorts\\n∙Chinese domestic market quiet ahead of lunar New Year, but demand is up\\n∙Chinese sellers reject bid to cover prior low-priced trader shorts\\n∙Turkish prices set to move up as traders are unwilling to provide additional aggressive quotes\\nShort term outlook\\nImproving. Oversupply remains, but the return of buyers needing to cover pent-up demand is set to influnce prices positively in the short term. A price-rally is not in the cards yet, but cannot be excluded if demand from the US remains strong and Brazilan developments trigger added purchasing in the region.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Prices hold for remaining urea\\nGranular urea bins at the distributor and retail level across the Midwest are exhausted in many\\ncases. Increasingly quotes to retailers are not based on prompt pick up, but on when warehouses can be restocked by barge when the upper Mississippi River system reopens for the spring.\\nThis situation is why prompt offers for the remaining granular urea as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota are holding at $260/st FOB, while river-open prices for the same point are closer to $250/st FOB. The lowest prompt price tag in the Midwest region remains $235/st FOB around St. Louis, Missouri, which still is accessible by barge.\\nCanada: Coop Federee purchase suggested\\nCanadian importer Coop Federee is reported to have booked a cargo of 20-25,000 mt granular urea with a trader supplying from the Baltic in February or early March at $212/mt CFR basis one-port discharge.\\nEvidently convinced that the market for granular urea may have reached a floor, the importer is suggested to be seeking an additional cargo for March loading.\\nUS NOLA: Thin trading, wide price spread\\nBy the end of the week\\'s trading, prompt granular urea barges had changed hands at $187-204/st FOB New Orleans, but with the market trending higher on amost each transaction.\\nNew Orleans values jumped starting February 2 after CF went shopping for prompt barges. The producer paid $198/st FOB New Orleans or more for two-four barges, but stepped away from the market when offers rose to $200/st FOB.\\nMultiple sales were confirmed as low as $187/st FOB February 1, but most prompt business appears to have occurred around $195-200/st FOB.\\nBids for 2H February started the week at $194/st FOB, but forward business has been booked up to $208/st FOB.\\nImport lineup\\nMeanwhile, a 40-45,000 mt cargo of granular urea and a 30-35,000 mt cargo of granular urea have been booked for March arrival in the US. The urea was bought at $195-200/mt FOB Middle East. The smaller of the two cargos is believed to belong to Keytrade, and will arrive in early March, thanks to taking the short route through the Suez canal. The larger cargo has been linked to just about every importer to the US market, but confirmation of ownership could not be secured at press time.\\nPreviously Koch was confirmed as owning a spot Chinese panamax due into New Orleans at the end of March, while Dreymoor will bring a PIC 40,000 mt contract cargo to the US Gulf next month.\\nMexico: Group testing prices February 4\\nThe Mexican Group of Importers is evaluating offers for 25,000 mt prilled or granular urea February 4. The enquiry called for offers to be submitted for the quantity to load in February/early March for discharge at three East Coast Mexico ports.\\nOther importers are also contemplating purchases, and will be following the Group tender closely for price guidance.\\nMexican imports of urea from January through\\nNovember were meanwhile assessed by customs at\\n1.43million mt, down by 0.5% on the same period in 2014.\\nImports from China were down by 5.9% to 756,000 mt and Russia was off by 1.2% to 484,000 mt. Arrivals from the UAE were up from zero to 52,000 mt while Ukraine was down by 52% to 43,400 mt.\\nNovember imports were off sharply from 149,000 in 2014 to 19,000 mt in 2015. Russia accounted for 18,200 mt of the November 2015 volume while arrivals from China were down from 127,000 mt in 2014 to 140 mt in 2015.\\nUS S. Plains: Sales may support higher prices\\nSome distributors along the Arkansas River who have sold most of their granular urea at $240/st FOB in recent days, believe demand is sufficient to move back up to $245/st FOB.\\nMany sellers in the region report a steady stream of retail demand, almost all of which appears to have been sold to meet prior sales to farmers. This means a great deal of retailer space remains to be filled before the top-dress run on winter wheat gets underway in force.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Credit and domestic corn values to aid imports\\nAs was highlighted in the February 2 Short Term Urea Forecast, optimism for additional demand for fertilizers in Brazil, particularly of urea, is fuelled following an announcement made by the Brazilian government in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil) regarding available credit.\\nUp to Brazilian Real (BRL)10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit were to be made available to farmers from February 1, according to Brazilian media channel Canal Rural.\\nSmall to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Program to Help Medium Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). With credit issues now resolved at rates of 7.75% p.a. for loans up to BRL 710,000 ($178,000) and at 8.75% for loans up to BRL 1.2 million ($300,000), farmers will have a highly significant advantage compared to rates charged by commercial banks in excess of 20% p.a.\\nThe early credit announcement follows complaints in 2015 that credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand. Brazilian calendar 2015 urea imports of 2.85 million mt were down by about 32.5% on 2014, according to GTIS customs data. The decline was mainly attributed to these credit issues and the sinking value of the real against the US dollar.\\nOn a further positive note for Brazilian farmers, domestic corn prices have surged substantially despite the sideways move in international corn values. Corn prices for domestic buyers in Rio Grande do Sul where farmers have harvested about 20% of the full-season crop are up by 45%. This is primarily due to a surge in corn exports, triggered via the significant depreciation of the Brazilian currency. Domestic livestock producers have faced shortages of corn due to the increase in exports, forcing values higher.\\nFavourable prices are expected to increase forward corn-planting. Farmers in southern Brazil have been reducing full-season corn acreage over the past decade in favour of more first-crop\\nsoybeans. Consequently, more than 65% of Brazil’s corn crop is now produced as a second crop planted after soybeans.\\nBrazil: Prompt values move higher\\nDelivered values for granular urea to arrive in February/early March are up this week following confirmed purchases ranging from a repeat of last week\\'s $195/mt CFR up to $205/mt CFR.\\nThe earlier Fertipar deal for 40,000 mt at numbers suggested in the upper $180s/mt CFR is based on open origin and furthermore with an option to load as late as May/June. Trammo is still suggested as the supplier.\\nOffers for additional cargoes for forward delivery are pegged no lower than $210/mt CFR, but these are yet to elicit firm buying interest.\\nColombia: Imports through November off slightly\\nJanuary-November imports of urea into Colombia of 489,000 mt were down by about 1.4% on the same period in 2014.\\nArrivals from China in 2015 were down by 8% and Venezuela was off by 14% to 169,000 mt and 142,000 mt, respectively. Russia was up 22% to 93,000 mt, UAE was up from zero to 45,000 mt while Venezuela suffered 56% setback to 18,600 mt.\\nNovember imports were down by 54% on the prior year, to reach 46,300 mt in 2015. China accounted for 27,000 mt (down 48%) and Venezuela was at 18,600 mt (down 56%).\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Grodno to retender as prices move up\\nGrodnoAzot opted not to accept bids at a $200-202/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent in its February 1 tender to sell 15,000 mt granular urea for prompt loading from the plant, and has issued a revised tender to close February 5 for 20,000 mt.\\nThe producer is seeking netbacks above $210/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, which contrasts netbacks available from recent business in Canada, reported at $212/mt CFR to Coop Federee for a $190/mt FOB return to the seller, at best.\\nGrodno has meanwhile withdrawn from the export market for prills, preferring to concentrate on sales to the domestic market at returns well in excess of a $200/mt FOB equivalent, according to the producer.\\nPrilled values are also up via sales to traders short on prior sales. Producers claim netbacks ranging from $188/mt FOB to $193/mt FOB. The high end reflects deals done for prills to load in combination with other products such as DAP and NPKs.\\nThe low end of the range is up sharply on returns in recent sales to Turkey, reported in prior Fertilizer Week issues, that would generate netbacks in the low $160s/mt FOB.\\nRussia: November exports up, but Jan-Nov declines\\nRussian producers exported 513,000 mt urea in November 2015, up 20.2% on November 2014. Shipments to Brazil of 121,000 mt were nevertheless down by 45%, but Turkey was up from 3,300 mt to 67,000 mt. Peru and Guatemala accounted for about 40,000 mt each, up from zero in November 2014.\\nJanuary-November exports of 4.3 million mt were however off by 8.9% on the same months in 2014. Brazil retained the lead with 1 million mt, but this was down by 12.7% on the prior year. Shipments to the US were up 28% to 591,000 mt while Turkey did not yet fully recover with 272,000 mt, a 3.1% decline.\\nPeru accounted for 206,000 mt, a 21% decline, and Germany was off by 21.4% to 198,000 mt. Ukraine was ahead 24.3% to 190,000 mt while shipments to Mexico declined 58% to 160,000 mt.\\nBlack Sea: Trade still lacks substantial drive\\nTrade in prilled urea from Yuzhnyy/TIS remains slow following sales as reported last week. Neither sellers nor buyers are prepared to make the necessary adjustments in price ideas needed to trigger additional deals in the short term, but sellers have the definite upper hand as requests for cover from traders increase.\\nOffers for February from producers and marketers were firmly above $195/mt FOB at the beginning of the week, with trades confirmed at $200/mt FOB. March is quoted no lower than $205/mt FOB, and firm bids bids are suggested at that number. The weekly range has been set accordingly.\\nVarious estimates circulate on the pricing in the deal between Salavat and EuroChem pursuant to the Salavat tender last week. While unconfirmed, consensus is building for a number around an even $180/mt FOB Tuapse or possibly marginally higher.\\nSalavat prills regularly sell at a significant discount to regular Black Sea prills due to quality issues, and the sales-price is therefore not included in the week\\'s Black Sea assessment. The level accepted by the producer is nevertheless widely used in negotiations for regular quality material, but efforts to that effect are being rejected by sellers.\\nJanuary shipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS did meanwhile marginally exceed 100,000 mt, and shipments plus fully firm nominations for February are close to 23,500 mt:\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Buyers largely retreat after recent purchases\\nSeemingly covered via purchases of more than 230,000 mt as highlighted in prior issues, Turkish buyers are not out in force again this week.\\nGubretas is evaluating offers received in its February 4 tender for 10,000 mt for prompt loading for Yarimca, but a decision is not expected to emerge before February 5. Details on offers submitted were not released, but repeat deals below $200/mt CFR with credit are highly unlikely given current quotes from the Black Sea around that number on FOB basis with payment at sight.\\nFrance: French Bay values down by about €5/mt\\nTrades in granular urea in the French Bay this week were concluded in a relatively wide spread at €217- 225/mt FCA, with the most recent deals done at the low end of the range.\\nThe low end reflects about $230/mt CIF, duty paid, which in turn suggests values from Egypt some $10/mt below the most recent sale at $215/mt FOB.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Outlook improving via sales formula deals\\nMiddle East producers are enjoying improvements in returns on spot sales and on quantities priced via formulae, with the netbacks from markets assessed at $195-204/mt FOB.\\nContract cargoes destined for Thailand are about $10/mt lower based on spot sales into that market below $200/mt CFR, but that number appears very unlikely to be repeated in the short term.\\nTwo traders are reported to have booked cargoes from Oman for February/early March loading at $195/mt FOB and $200/mt FOB, respectively, and SIUCI has adjusted offers for additional March availability to $205/mt, according to traders in discussions with the producer.\\nUS prices that surged to a peak of $204/st FOB barge at New Orleans over the week would provide sellers with returns around $218/mt CIF Mississippi River. Forward deals were also concluded some $5-7/mt lower, for netbacks at $197-204/mt FOB Middle East after deduction of freight, charges and a small margin to intermediaries on cargoes with freight fixed in the spot market.\\nSouth Africa: December imports up, calendar year lower\\nSouth African urea importers took delivery of 63,900 mt in December 2015, an increase of 28.5% on December 2014. UAE arrivals of 27,000 mt were up by 47% while China and Saudi Arabia were up from zero to 24,500 mt and 12,500 mt, respectively. Qatar was down from 26,000 mt in November 2014 to zero in 2015.\\nCalendar 2015 imports were nevertheless down by almost 27% on 2014, to 663,000 mt. Qatar retained the lead with 231,000 mt, a 1.6% decline, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia were down 11% to 184,000 mt. The UAE accounted for 141,000 mt, up from 45,000 mt in the prior year.\\nRussian arrivals were down 15% to 28,000 mt while China nosedived from 236,000 mt in 2014 to 25,000 mt in 2015, and Oman was off by 73% to 22,000 mt.\\nEgypt: New sale at lower number\\nMainstream bids for granular urea from traders are in the low $210s/mt FOB, but these are rejected by producers. Suppliers are stating firm intent not to concede numbers below the $215/mt FOB low concluded for a spot prompt 20,000 mt this week, and also cite significant demand at substantially higher returns in the domestic free-trade market.\\nA subsequent sale at $220/mt FOB has been reported, but this could not be verified and has not been included in the week\\'s assessment.\\nHFC is planning to tender next week for the sale of as much as 30,000 mt granular urea to load by the end of February, and other producers are likely to follow with tenders.\\nMOPCO reported this week that the rupture/explosion that occurred January 25 on the PetroGas pipeline between Port Said and Damietta feeding the MOPCO I, II and III ammonia and urea units interrupted all output of urea. The producer expects pipeline repairs to be completed within about 10 days, and regular flow of urea to recommence around February 15.\\nMOPCO is confident that gas supply to its plants at Damietta will be not interrupted this summer in favour of power generation.\\nNew LNG import facilities and the need for Egypt to draw in foreign currency from export sales will keep summer operating rates around 70-75%, the company said in Cairo.\\nThe government plans as many as three new LNG regasification terminals over the next two years, taking the total to five. The three new terminals are all planned for the Red Sea coast.\\nThe Damietta pipeline incident had limited impact on other producers. Egyfert (EFC) is reporting output at about 80% of rated capacity and Alexfert (AFC) is at 85%. Helwan (HFC) reported February 3 that output was restored after a 72 hour outage, and the plant is now running at 90% of rated capacity.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: November imports down, but Jan-Nov up\\nImports of urea by India ascertained by customs in November 2015 were 620,000 mt, a 51% drop on November 2014, but Iranian arrivals were up from 33,000 mt to 311,000 mt.\\nChinese arrivals were down from 1.16 million mt in\\nNovember 2014 to 169,000 mt in 2015 while\\nOman was up 71% to 134,000 mt.\\nThe January-November volume was nevertheless up by 59% to 8.66 million mt with China in the lead at 4.6 million mt, an increase of 27%. Omani arrivals were up by 58% to 2.07 million mt and Iran was up from 407,000 mt to 1.62 million mt.\\nImports from Ukraine were 118,000 mt and Qatar accounted for 71,000 mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nIndonesia: Kaltim formula tender yet to be floated\\nThe expected Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of up to 500,000 mt granular urea to load via formula contracts through June is yet to be floated by the new management of the producer.\\nLocal reports suggest that Kaltim low regional prices in recent weeeks may result in a switch from urea exports to ammonia exports, but this is yet to be confirmed.\\nWith regional urea values improving slightly while prices for ammonia continue to decline, urea may again become the favoured product. That will however be contingent on further increases to match Kaltim\\'s costs assessed above $230/mt FOB which form part of the formula agreements with urea offtakers.\\nChina: Market defies short traders\\nActivity in China is at low ebb due to the regional lunar New Year festivities, but prices for prilled and granular urea have been moving up in recent days, triggered not only by domestic demand for blending and\\ndirect application, but also by traders short on prior sales seeking cover for relatively prompt shipment for export.\\nSales of prills are reported back up to $195/mt FOB, and standard quality granular has traded a fraction below $200/mt FOB. Offers for additional February tonnage are suggested closer to $205/mt FOB for both grades from main ports.\\nSmaller lots from river ports can still be secured in the low $190s/mt FOB, according to regional traders, but bids from buyers attempting to cover prior shorts requiring values into the $170s/mt to become profitable are being ignored/rejected.\\nThailand: Liven books granular\\nLiven booked a cargo of about 20,000 mt Middle East granular urea with a Thai importer for February loading. The trader did not disclose the price agreed, but local reports suggests a delivered value in the mid to upper $190s/mt CFR.\\nThis implies a producer-return in the low $180s/mt FOB from the Middle East for Liven to generate a margin.\\nOffers are since up significantly for Middle East material, reflecting recent sales to other markets in the $190s/mt FOB and forward quotes above $200/mt FOB.\\nMalaysia: NAFAS books prills from China\\nMalaysian importer/farmers\\' union NAFAS secured cover for 6,000 mt prilled urea for February loading for western Malaysia discharge around an even $200/mt CFR, according to regional traders. Netbacks to Chinese suppliers from river-ports are assessed below $185/mt FOB.\\nSouth Korea: Sales of Chinese granular at low prices\\nPricing slightly south of $200/mt CFR is reported in the two tenders for granular urea in South Korea in the end-January tenders by Pungnong (6,000 mt) and KG Chemical (3,000 mt). Shipment was requested by 20- 29 February in the sessions.\\nFreight and transaction charges are assessed marginally above $15/mt. This is indicative of netbacks to sellers loading from small Chinese river-ports in the low $180s/mt FOB, more than $12/mt below current mainstream quotes for large parcels to load from main ports.\\nPhilippines: Imports through October decline\\nOctober imports of urea by Philippine buyers of 56,800 mt were down by 49.4% on the 112,000 mt imported in October 2014. Arrivals from Malaysia were nevertheless ahead by 33% to 30,800 mt while China was off 63% to 22,700 mt.\\nThe October arrivals lifted the January-October volume close to 590,000 mt, down by 3.8% on the prior year. China was ahead 2% to 275,000 mt, and arrivals from Qatar were up by 247% to 93,500 mt. Shipments originating in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia were down by 63% and 87% to 25,300 mt and 6,000 mt, respectively.\\nNew Zealand: Calendar 2015 imports up close to 10%\\nCalendar 2015 imports of urea into New Zealand of 598,000 mt were up by about 9.7% on calendar 2014, with Saudi Arabia in the lead with 346,000 mt, an increase of 3.1%.\\nThis was followed by China with 115,000 mt, up by 1.5%. Arrivals from Malaysia were 61% ahead at 71,000 mt, and Indonesia was up 26% to 58,000 mt.\\nImports in December 2015 of 75,800 mt were down 16.1% on December 2014, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia in December 2015 of 31,900 mt were off by 48%. China accounted for 28,800 mt, up from 204 mt in December 2014, but Malaysia was down by 48.4% to 14,200 mt.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Production at the site started at the end of 2015.\\nThe plant is part of OCP\\'s ambitious strategy to increase fertilizer production to 12 million mt by 2017 with a second hub set to come online by the end of Q2 2016.\\nENVIRONMENT\\nK+S cuts saline waste production by 50%\\nK+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.\\nThe potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to reduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.\\n“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer Gerling said.\\nFurther measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.\\nIn December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though\\nthe authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.\\nFREIGHT/SHIPPING\\nFreight markets tumble on abundance of vessels\\nThe Baltic Exchange Dry Index has now sunk below 300 points for the first time on record, having begun 2016 at 473 points.\\nIn the geared vessel sector, Supramax average earnings sunk to $2,837/day and the Handysize average to $2,909/day, both standing at their lowest levels since the Baltic Exchange assessments began (in 2005 and 2006 respectively). More significantly many are failing to cover their operating costs, much of this is a result of the oversupply of vessels.\\nCombined Brazilian exports of corn and soya (bean+meal) in January, at 6 million mt, were the lowest since February 2015 and down by 2 million mt from December 2015, according to Trade Ministry statistics.\\nThe Latin American grain export season has been boosted by export initiatives by the new government in Argentina which has contributed to a contango in FFA prices. At close of business on February 3, Q2, 2016 futures contracts for Supramax and Handysize vessels were trading at premiums of approximately $1,700/day and $1,000/day to their prevailing spot earnings.\\nThe sharpness of the contango in freight pricing has been offset by continued growth in fleet supply. January saw a dramatic jump in dry bulk newbuild deliveries, with preliminary figures from SSY, 58 geared vessels of\\n2.85Mdwt have entered service since the beginning of 2016, the highest since January 2015. The heaviest newbuild deliveries (26 ships of 1.62 Mdwt) in January have continued to be seen for Ultramax (60,000- 64,999 dwt) design.\\nLEGISLATION\\nBrazil receives early farm credit boost\\nThe Brazilian government, in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil), have announced that BRL 10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, according to consultancy \\'The Soybean and Corn Advisor\\'.\\nThis early announcement of credit follows complaints in 2015, when credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand.\\nSmall to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Programme to Help Medium-Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). Loans for BRL 710,000 ($180,000) have an interest rate of 7.75% and loans of BRL 1,200,000 ($304,350) see a rate of 8.75%. These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nCF/CHS supply deal getting under way\\nCF Industries and CHS Inc. commenced their previously announced nitrogen fertilizer strategic venture February 1.\\nCHS completed its $2.8 billion equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen LLC, a CF Industries subsidiary, and will begin receiving delivery of urea and UAN from CF Industries under a long-term supply agreement.\\nCHS’ investment entitles it to purchase up to 1.1 million st granular urea and 580,000 st UAN annually from CF Nitrogen. The 1.7 million st of product available under the supply agreement represents approximately 8.9% of CF’s total production capacity once its expansion projects are completed at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa in 2016.\\nCHS also will be entitled to semi-annual profit distributions from CF Nitrogen based generally on the volume of granular urea and UAN purchased by CHS pursuant to the supply agreement.\\nPRODUCTION\\nPhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%\\nRussian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.\\nDespite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.\\nPhosAgro\\'s DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.\\nSeparately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.\\nRegarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.\\nOverall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.\\nDespite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.\\nRegarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro\\'s new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.\\nHowever, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.\\nEgypt: Misr Phosphate expands mining with three sites\\nMisr Phosphate is now operating three phosphate rock mines in Egypt, and recently began work at a new site.\\nAlongside production estimated at about 2 million mt/year for Abu-Tartour, the government-owned entity began operations at El Sibiya site close to the Red Sea two months ago, with its first shipment due to load out of Safaga.\\nEl Sibiya produces 27-30% P2O5 rock, as well as 24-25% P2O5, Misr Phosphate said in Cairo.\\nThe company also resumed operations at the Red Sea Mine, which produces higher-grade 30-32% P2O5 ore. There are said to be 500 workers on site and production estimates vary from 15,000 mt a month currently to about 40,000 mt.\\nMisr Phosphate receives only a small percentage of revenue for managing operations at the Red Sea mine but hopes to be awarded outright control in the near future.\\nCombined production from the three mines is estimated by the company to reach about 3 million mt/year.\\nMisr Phosphate and El Nasr Mining are still considering price-coordination to establish a single FOB price for each grade of rock exported from Egypt. The idea is understood to be encountering resistance from traders.\\nUralchem boosts fertilizer output in 2015\\nUralchem maintained steady production of ammonium nitrate (AN) in 2015 at 2.92 million mt while boosting output of merchant ammonia by 6% to 825,000 mt.\\nUrea production reached 1.18 million mt last year, up 7% on 2014.\\nUralchem also produced 617,000 mt complex fertilizers, exceeding the 2014 figure by 18%.\\nProduction increases were attributed to higher daily output across all plants and a “significant reduction in unscheduled downtime hours”.\\nUralchem’s average daily ammonia output increased 1.5% while unscheduled downtime hours were reduced by 40.3%.\\n“In spite of the complex situation in both the industry and the economy in general, we closed the year with a good performance,” said Dmitry Konyaev, Uralchem CEO.\\n“Last year we adopted the updated development strategy for 2016-2020. It envisages not only development of current capacities and improvement of production energy efficiency, but also a serious investment programme of new construction,” Konyaev said.\\nCRU reported late last year that Uralchem had completed a 550 million rouble investment project at its Kirovo-Chepetsk ammonia facility. Capacity improvement work was undertaken during a maintenance shutdown in October-November this year. Ammonia production capacity was increased 3% to 1,750 mt/day.\\nAmmonia leak reported at Yara\\'s Pilbara facility\\nAn ammonia leak that prompted eight contractors to be taken to hospital is currently being investigated at Yara’s Pilbara, Australia facility.\\nThe leak happened February 2.\\nIn a written statement to ABC Australia, Yara Pilbara defended its response to the leak and said emergency crews responded quickly to contain the leak and help affected workers.\\nThe company said it will work with authorities to ensure a thorough investigation.\\nAt the time of writing ammonia production at the 850,000 mt/year capacity plant was at normal rates following the leak.\\nThe plant restarted full ammonia production January 9-10 this year following a rupture in the plant’s sea water cooling system October 11, 2015 and subsequent technical issues.\\nPROJECTS\\nEgypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes\\nEgypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.\\nBoth projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.\\nThe El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.\\nAbout 3.1 million mt of rock is required and \"secured at preferential prices,\" according to the prospectus. The project \"will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government\".\\nProduction of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.\\nThe investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project\\'s sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.\\nIn November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals\\' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.\\nIt will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid, with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export. Construction will be compressed into 30 months, El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals said in Cairo this week.\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

VAT at 13% is incorporated from September for both\\nANALYSIS\\nUndertone firmer on prospects of pent-up demand\\nA firmer undertone was evident in global urea markets as the first week of February progressed, albeit after some downward adjustments from select sources. The January slide in prices from all origins has halted, and some improvements were registered in delivered values, which in turn prompted more buyers to reappear for coverage.\\nPriced substantially above other sources, Egyptian producers did concede a discount of around\\n$9/mt on deals concluded at $224/mt FOB last week, but producers are since claiming to have recaptured the lost ground. Outages in Egypt on a ruptured pipeline were initially expected to fuel substantial price- increases, but a rapid return to normality will likely limit prospects for significant improvement in the short term.\\nEuropean values also lost some ground based on sales concluded last week from the Middle East and poorer returns on US sales to regional producers at that time, but the reversal in the US pricing has since provided better netbacks and boosted expectations for further gains.\\nThe US has been and remains the key market in supporting a change in direction so far. Prompt granular urea barge values at New Orleans gained $17/st from the start of the week to the end, although the average week over week rose only $1/st. However, forward physical sales for late February and March reached\\n$208/st FOB. Overall US traders were marginally bullish on granular urea heading into next week\\'s annual TFI Business Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\\nMore optimism has also spilled over to FSU supply of granular urea. After failing to achive interest much above $190/mt FOB in prior sessions, GrodnoAzot opted to reject bids more than $10/mt higher in its February 1 tender, and is aiming for more when retendering February 5 for the sale of 20,000 mt.\\nBrazilian prices for granular urea have improved on the back of firmer US sentiment, and suppliers are optimimistic that relatively inexpensive credit available to small and mid-sized farms will combine with significantly higher corn prices in the domestic market to stimulate forward offtake and imports of urea.\\nOther importers in the Americas also appear to have sensed that urea values may be closer to a floor, and have emerged with requirements for prompt and forward positions of prilled and granular urea. Prices are being tested this week for both grades in Mexico, while buying interest also reappeared for granular imports from Canada.\\nMarkets and supply-sources in Asia have been relatively quiet leading up to celebrations and holidays for lunar New Year, but buyers needing to cover short positions for prompt loading did have to concede higher costs to secure cover.\\nWhile too early to predict a major surge in prices, traders that shorted prills and granular urea at netbacks some $20/mt below current values appear unlikely to secure cover at a margin on positions that need to load by March, and some positions could well result in substantial losses.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙US NOLA prompt and forward prices gained all week, and\\n∙Inland distributors can support $5-10/st higher barge costs even without raising inland prices\\n∙Brazilian buyers face higher offers, accordingly, and are left with few options but to accept\\n∙Middle East netbacks up on US and Brazilian improvements and spot sales\\n∙Egyptian prices adjust lower via sale of 20,000 mt for prompt loading\\n∙Baltic prices surge as traders cover in, and prior short sales look scary\\n∙Black Sea values stable to firm and traders unwilling to add aggressive shorts\\n∙Chinese domestic market quiet ahead of lunar New Year, but demand is up\\n∙Chinese sellers reject bid to cover prior low-priced trader shorts\\n∙Turkish prices set to move up as traders are unwilling to provide additional aggressive quotes\\nShort term outlook\\nImproving. Oversupply remains, but the return of buyers needing to cover pent-up demand is set to influnce prices positively in the short term. A price-rally is not in the cards yet, but cannot be excluded if demand from the US remains strong and Brazilan developments trigger added purchasing in the region.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Prices hold for remaining urea\\nGranular urea bins at the distributor and retail level across the Midwest are exhausted in many\\ncases. Increasingly quotes to retailers are not based on prompt pick up, but on when warehouses can be restocked by barge when the upper Mississippi River system reopens for the spring.\\nThis situation is why prompt offers for the remaining granular urea as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota are holding at $260/st FOB, while river-open prices for the same point are closer to $250/st FOB. The lowest prompt price tag in the Midwest region remains $235/st FOB around St. Louis, Missouri, which still is accessible by barge.\\nCanada: Coop Federee purchase suggested\\nCanadian importer Coop Federee is reported to have booked a cargo of 20-25,000 mt granular urea with a trader supplying from the Baltic in February or early March at $212/mt CFR basis one-port discharge.\\nEvidently convinced that the market for granular urea may have reached a floor, the importer is suggested to be seeking an additional cargo for March loading.\\nUS NOLA: Thin trading, wide price spread\\nBy the end of the week\\'s trading, prompt granular urea barges had changed hands at $187-204/st FOB New Orleans, but with the market trending higher on amost each transaction.\\nNew Orleans values jumped starting February 2 after CF went shopping for prompt barges. The producer paid $198/st FOB New Orleans or more for two-four barges, but stepped away from the market when offers rose to $200/st FOB.\\nMultiple sales were confirmed as low as $187/st FOB February 1, but most prompt business appears to have occurred around $195-200/st FOB.\\nBids for 2H February started the week at $194/st FOB, but forward business has been booked up to $208/st FOB.\\nImport lineup\\nMeanwhile, a 40-45,000 mt cargo of granular urea and a 30-35,000 mt cargo of granular urea have been booked for March arrival in the US. The urea was bought at $195-200/mt FOB Middle East. The smaller of the two cargos is believed to belong to Keytrade, and will arrive in early March, thanks to taking the short route through the Suez canal. The larger cargo has been linked to just about every importer to the US market, but confirmation of ownership could not be secured at press time.\\nPreviously Koch was confirmed as owning a spot Chinese panamax due into New Orleans at the end of March, while Dreymoor will bring a PIC 40,000 mt contract cargo to the US Gulf next month.\\nMexico: Group testing prices February 4\\nThe Mexican Group of Importers is evaluating offers for 25,000 mt prilled or granular urea February 4. The enquiry called for offers to be submitted for the quantity to load in February/early March for discharge at three East Coast Mexico ports.\\nOther importers are also contemplating purchases, and will be following the Group tender closely for price guidance.\\nMexican imports of urea from January through\\nNovember were meanwhile assessed by customs at\\n1.43million mt, down by 0.5% on the same period in 2014.\\nImports from China were down by 5.9% to 756,000 mt and Russia was off by 1.2% to 484,000 mt. Arrivals from the UAE were up from zero to 52,000 mt while Ukraine was down by 52% to 43,400 mt.\\nNovember imports were off sharply from 149,000 in 2014 to 19,000 mt in 2015. Russia accounted for 18,200 mt of the November 2015 volume while arrivals from China were down from 127,000 mt in 2014 to 140 mt in 2015.\\nUS S. Plains: Sales may support higher prices\\nSome distributors along the Arkansas River who have sold most of their granular urea at $240/st FOB in recent days, believe demand is sufficient to move back up to $245/st FOB.\\nMany sellers in the region report a steady stream of retail demand, almost all of which appears to have been sold to meet prior sales to farmers. This means a great deal of retailer space remains to be filled before the top-dress run on winter wheat gets underway in force.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Credit and domestic corn values to aid imports\\nAs was highlighted in the February 2 Short Term Urea Forecast, optimism for additional demand for fertilizers in Brazil, particularly of urea, is fuelled following an announcement made by the Brazilian government in conjunction with Banco do Brasil (Bank of Brazil) regarding available credit.\\nUp to Brazilian Real (BRL)10 billion ($2.51 billion) in credit were to be made available to farmers from February 1, according to Brazilian media channel Canal Rural.\\nSmall to medium sized farmers can receive loans for input purchasing through the National Program to Help Medium Sized Rural Producers (PRONAMP). With credit issues now resolved at rates of 7.75% p.a. for loans up to BRL 710,000 ($178,000) and at 8.75% for loans up to BRL 1.2 million ($300,000), farmers will have a highly significant advantage compared to rates charged by commercial banks in excess of 20% p.a.\\nThe early credit announcement follows complaints in 2015 that credit was not available until May/June, significantly cutting farm budgets and fertilizer demand. Brazilian calendar 2015 urea imports of 2.85 million mt were down by about 32.5% on 2014, according to GTIS customs data. The decline was mainly attributed to these credit issues and the sinking value of the real against the US dollar.\\nOn a further positive note for Brazilian farmers, domestic corn prices have surged substantially despite the sideways move in international corn values. Corn prices for domestic buyers in Rio Grande do Sul where farmers have harvested about 20% of the full-season crop are up by 45%. This is primarily due to a surge in corn exports, triggered via the significant depreciation of the Brazilian currency. Domestic livestock producers have faced shortages of corn due to the increase in exports, forcing values higher.\\nFavourable prices are expected to increase forward corn-planting. Farmers in southern Brazil have been reducing full-season corn acreage over the past decade in favour of more first-crop\\nsoybeans. Consequently, more than 65% of Brazil’s corn crop is now produced as a second crop planted after soybeans.\\nBrazil: Prompt values move higher\\nDelivered values for granular urea to arrive in February/early March are up this week following confirmed purchases ranging from a repeat of last week\\'s $195/mt CFR up to $205/mt CFR.\\nThe earlier Fertipar deal for 40,000 mt at numbers suggested in the upper $180s/mt CFR is based on open origin and furthermore with an option to load as late as May/June. Trammo is still suggested as the supplier.\\nOffers for additional cargoes for forward delivery are pegged no lower than $210/mt CFR, but these are yet to elicit firm buying interest.\\nColombia: Imports through November off slightly\\nJanuary-November imports of urea into Colombia of 489,000 mt were down by about 1.4% on the same period in 2014.\\nArrivals from China in 2015 were down by 8% and Venezuela was off by 14% to 169,000 mt and 142,000 mt, respectively. Russia was up 22% to 93,000 mt, UAE was up from zero to 45,000 mt while Venezuela suffered 56% setback to 18,600 mt.\\nNovember imports were down by 54% on the prior year, to reach 46,300 mt in 2015. China accounted for 27,000 mt (down 48%) and Venezuela was at 18,600 mt (down 56%).\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Grodno to retender as prices move up\\nGrodnoAzot opted not to accept bids at a $200-202/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent in its February 1 tender to sell 15,000 mt granular urea for prompt loading from the plant, and has issued a revised tender to close February 5 for 20,000 mt.\\nThe producer is seeking netbacks above $210/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, which contrasts netbacks available from recent business in Canada, reported at $212/mt CFR to Coop Federee for a $190/mt FOB return to the seller, at best.\\nGrodno has meanwhile withdrawn from the export market for prills, preferring to concentrate on sales to the domestic market at returns well in excess of a $200/mt FOB equivalent, according to the producer.\\nPrilled values are also up via sales to traders short on prior sales. Producers claim netbacks ranging from $188/mt FOB to $193/mt FOB. The high end reflects deals done for prills to load in combination with other products such as DAP and NPKs.\\nThe low end of the range is up sharply on returns in recent sales to Turkey, reported in prior Fertilizer Week issues, that would generate netbacks in the low $160s/mt FOB.\\nRussia: November exports up, but Jan-Nov declines\\nRussian producers exported 513,000 mt urea in November 2015, up 20.2% on November 2014. Shipments to Brazil of 121,000 mt were nevertheless down by 45%, but Turkey was up from 3,300 mt to 67,000 mt. Peru and Guatemala accounted for about 40,000 mt each, up from zero in November 2014.\\nJanuary-November exports of 4.3 million mt were however off by 8.9% on the same months in 2014. Brazil retained the lead with 1 million mt, but this was down by 12.7% on the prior year. Shipments to the US were up 28% to 591,000 mt while Turkey did not yet fully recover with 272,000 mt, a 3.1% decline.\\nPeru accounted for 206,000 mt, a 21% decline, and Germany was off by 21.4% to 198,000 mt. Ukraine was ahead 24.3% to 190,000 mt while shipments to Mexico declined 58% to 160,000 mt.\\nBlack Sea: Trade still lacks substantial drive\\nTrade in prilled urea from Yuzhnyy/TIS remains slow following sales as reported last week. Neither sellers nor buyers are prepared to make the necessary adjustments in price ideas needed to trigger additional deals in the short term, but sellers have the definite upper hand as requests for cover from traders increase.\\nOffers for February from producers and marketers were firmly above $195/mt FOB at the beginning of the week, with trades confirmed at $200/mt FOB. March is quoted no lower than $205/mt FOB, and firm bids bids are suggested at that number. The weekly range has been set accordingly.\\nVarious estimates circulate on the pricing in the deal between Salavat and EuroChem pursuant to the Salavat tender last week. While unconfirmed, consensus is building for a number around an even $180/mt FOB Tuapse or possibly marginally higher.\\nSalavat prills regularly sell at a significant discount to regular Black Sea prills due to quality issues, and the sales-price is therefore not included in the week\\'s Black Sea assessment. The level accepted by the producer is nevertheless widely used in negotiations for regular quality material, but efforts to that effect are being rejected by sellers.\\nJanuary shipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS did meanwhile marginally exceed 100,000 mt, and shipments plus fully firm nominations for February are close to 23,500 mt:\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Buyers largely retreat after recent purchases\\nSeemingly covered via purchases of more than 230,000 mt as highlighted in prior issues, Turkish buyers are not out in force again this week.\\nGubretas is evaluating offers received in its February 4 tender for 10,000 mt for prompt loading for Yarimca, but a decision is not expected to emerge before February 5. Details on offers submitted were not released, but repeat deals below $200/mt CFR with credit are highly unlikely given current quotes from the Black Sea around that number on FOB basis with payment at sight.\\nFrance: French Bay values down by about €5/mt\\nTrades in granular urea in the French Bay this week were concluded in a relatively wide spread at €217- 225/mt FCA, with the most recent deals done at the low end of the range.\\nThe low end reflects about $230/mt CIF, duty paid, which in turn suggests values from Egypt some $10/mt below the most recent sale at $215/mt FOB.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Outlook improving via sales formula deals\\nMiddle East producers are enjoying improvements in returns on spot sales and on quantities priced via formulae, with the netbacks from markets assessed at $195-204/mt FOB.\\nContract cargoes destined for Thailand are about $10/mt lower based on spot sales into that market below $200/mt CFR, but that number appears very unlikely to be repeated in the short term.\\nTwo traders are reported to have booked cargoes from Oman for February/early March loading at $195/mt FOB and $200/mt FOB, respectively, and SIUCI has adjusted offers for additional March availability to $205/mt, according to traders in discussions with the producer.\\nUS prices that surged to a peak of $204/st FOB barge at New Orleans over the week would provide sellers with returns around $218/mt CIF Mississippi River. Forward deals were also concluded some $5-7/mt lower, for netbacks at $197-204/mt FOB Middle East after deduction of freight, charges and a small margin to intermediaries on cargoes with freight fixed in the spot market.\\nSouth Africa: December imports up, calendar year lower\\nSouth African urea importers took delivery of 63,900 mt in December 2015, an increase of 28.5% on December 2014. UAE arrivals of 27,000 mt were up by 47% while China and Saudi Arabia were up from zero to 24,500 mt and 12,500 mt, respectively. Qatar was down from 26,000 mt in November 2014 to zero in 2015.\\nCalendar 2015 imports were nevertheless down by almost 27% on 2014, to 663,000 mt. Qatar retained the lead with 231,000 mt, a 1.6% decline, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia were down 11% to 184,000 mt. The UAE accounted for 141,000 mt, up from 45,000 mt in the prior year.\\nRussian arrivals were down 15% to 28,000 mt while China nosedived from 236,000 mt in 2014 to 25,000 mt in 2015, and Oman was off by 73% to 22,000 mt.\\nEgypt: New sale at lower number\\nMainstream bids for granular urea from traders are in the low $210s/mt FOB, but these are rejected by producers. Suppliers are stating firm intent not to concede numbers below the $215/mt FOB low concluded for a spot prompt 20,000 mt this week, and also cite significant demand at substantially higher returns in the domestic free-trade market.\\nA subsequent sale at $220/mt FOB has been reported, but this could not be verified and has not been included in the week\\'s assessment.\\nHFC is planning to tender next week for the sale of as much as 30,000 mt granular urea to load by the end of February, and other producers are likely to follow with tenders.\\nMOPCO reported this week that the rupture/explosion that occurred January 25 on the PetroGas pipeline between Port Said and Damietta feeding the MOPCO I, II and III ammonia and urea units interrupted all output of urea. The producer expects pipeline repairs to be completed within about 10 days, and regular flow of urea to recommence around February 15.\\nMOPCO is confident that gas supply to its plants at Damietta will be not interrupted this summer in favour of power generation.\\nNew LNG import facilities and the need for Egypt to draw in foreign currency from export sales will keep summer operating rates around 70-75%, the company said in Cairo.\\nThe government plans as many as three new LNG regasification terminals over the next two years, taking the total to five. The three new terminals are all planned for the Red Sea coast.\\nThe Damietta pipeline incident had limited impact on other producers. Egyfert (EFC) is reporting output at about 80% of rated capacity and Alexfert (AFC) is at 85%. Helwan (HFC) reported February 3 that output was restored after a 72 hour outage, and the plant is now running at 90% of rated capacity.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: November imports down, but Jan-Nov up\\nImports of urea by India ascertained by customs in November 2015 were 620,000 mt, a 51% drop on November 2014, but Iranian arrivals were up from 33,000 mt to 311,000 mt.\\nChinese arrivals were down from 1.16 million mt in\\nNovember 2014 to 169,000 mt in 2015 while\\nOman was up 71% to 134,000 mt.\\nThe January-November volume was nevertheless up by 59% to 8.66 million mt with China in the lead at 4.6 million mt, an increase of 27%. Omani arrivals were up by 58% to 2.07 million mt and Iran was up from 407,000 mt to 1.62 million mt.\\nImports from Ukraine were 118,000 mt and Qatar accounted for 71,000 mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nIndonesia: Kaltim formula tender yet to be floated\\nThe expected Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of up to 500,000 mt granular urea to load via formula contracts through June is yet to be floated by the new management of the producer.\\nLocal reports suggest that Kaltim low regional prices in recent weeeks may result in a switch from urea exports to ammonia exports, but this is yet to be confirmed.\\nWith regional urea values improving slightly while prices for ammonia continue to decline, urea may again become the favoured product. That will however be contingent on further increases to match Kaltim\\'s costs assessed above $230/mt FOB which form part of the formula agreements with urea offtakers.\\nChina: Market defies short traders\\nActivity in China is at low ebb due to the regional lunar New Year festivities, but prices for prilled and granular urea have been moving up in recent days, triggered not only by domestic demand for blending and\\ndirect application, but also by traders short on prior sales seeking cover for relatively prompt shipment for export.\\nSales of prills are reported back up to $195/mt FOB, and standard quality granular has traded a fraction below $200/mt FOB. Offers for additional February tonnage are suggested closer to $205/mt FOB for both grades from main ports.\\nSmaller lots from river ports can still be secured in the low $190s/mt FOB, according to regional traders, but bids from buyers attempting to cover prior shorts requiring values into the $170s/mt to become profitable are being ignored/rejected.\\nThailand: Liven books granular\\nLiven booked a cargo of about 20,000 mt Middle East granular urea with a Thai importer for February loading. The trader did not disclose the price agreed, but local reports suggests a delivered value in the mid to upper $190s/mt CFR.\\nThis implies a producer-return in the low $180s/mt FOB from the Middle East for Liven to generate a margin.\\nOffers are since up significantly for Middle East material, reflecting recent sales to other markets in the $190s/mt FOB and forward quotes above $200/mt FOB.\\nMalaysia: NAFAS books prills from China\\nMalaysian importer/farmers\\' union NAFAS secured cover for 6,000 mt prilled urea for February loading for western Malaysia discharge around an even $200/mt CFR, according to regional traders. Netbacks to Chinese suppliers from river-ports are assessed below $185/mt FOB.\\nSouth Korea: Sales of Chinese granular at low prices\\nPricing slightly south of $200/mt CFR is reported in the two tenders for granular urea in South Korea in the end-January tenders by Pungnong (6,000 mt) and KG Chemical (3,000 mt). Shipment was requested by 20- 29 February in the sessions.\\nFreight and transaction charges are assessed marginally above $15/mt. This is indicative of netbacks to sellers loading from small Chinese river-ports in the low $180s/mt FOB, more than $12/mt below current mainstream quotes for large parcels to load from main ports.\\nPhilippines: Imports through October decline\\nOctober imports of urea by Philippine buyers of 56,800 mt were down by 49.4% on the 112,000 mt imported in October 2014. Arrivals from Malaysia were nevertheless ahead by 33% to 30,800 mt while China was off 63% to 22,700 mt.\\nThe October arrivals lifted the January-October volume close to 590,000 mt, down by 3.8% on the prior year. China was ahead 2% to 275,000 mt, and arrivals from Qatar were up by 247% to 93,500 mt. Shipments originating in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia were down by 63% and 87% to 25,300 mt and 6,000 mt, respectively.\\nNew Zealand: Calendar 2015 imports up close to 10%\\nCalendar 2015 imports of urea into New Zealand of 598,000 mt were up by about 9.7% on calendar 2014, with Saudi Arabia in the lead with 346,000 mt, an increase of 3.1%.\\nThis was followed by China with 115,000 mt, up by 1.5%. Arrivals from Malaysia were 61% ahead at 71,000 mt, and Indonesia was up 26% to 58,000 mt.\\nImports in December 2015 of 75,800 mt were down 16.1% on December 2014, while arrivals from Saudi Arabia in December 2015 of 31,900 mt were off by 48%. China accounted for 28,800 mt, up from 204 mt in December 2014, but Malaysia was down by 48.4% to 14,200 mt.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Abu Qir\\'s tender next week will provide and indication on the extent of discounts required for buyers to re-enter with the intent of shipping to Europe.\\nSome producers are all still contemplating UAN production cuts to rather than selling at break-even at best, or at a loss.\\nAbu Qir is looking to improve on the $140/mt FOB price achieved in its January 26 tender, but this appears unlikely at present. Dependent on the outcome in its February 8 tender the producer will limit or altogether stop production of UAN.\\nBunge bought 25,000 mt of UAN from Nitron for Argentina, likely to be loaded from CF production out of the US.\\nAchema\\'s 1.36 million mt/year UAN plants are still at limited output due to a technical issue in one of its ammonia lines since January 2016. The units are expected to start production in February, with availablity ample in March.\\nGrodnoAzot remains quiet on UAN, and is reported to be continuing to place output in the domestic market, claiming returns well above those currently available in the export market.\\nUS activity is seasonaly modest, but barge offers have not declined in the last couple of weeks, while inland resale values also are relatively steady. Next week\\'s TFI annual business meeting and the March US planting forecast likely will provide key guidance for UAN prices going forward.\\nTerminals at Rouen and Germany are well covered with very little capacity to take on more UAN in the short term. Prices have declined to €150-155/mt FCA in France with Germany reporting no recent business.\\nChina will be quiet during the lunar New Year holiday period, but producers are continuing to limit production on poor netbacks. Even so there will be some quantities available to load at the end of February. The Chinese price is assessed at $145-150/mt FOB.\\nAmmonium Sulphate\\nAny hope for an big increase in demand for AS has now dissipated due to upcoming holidays in China and an end to buying for the Safrinha crop in Brazil.\\nChinese producers are in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations with caprolactam grade product now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.\\nOffers for caprolactam grade AS from China into Brazil meanwhile are widely available at $130/mt CFR, although there is little business done as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down.\\nTurkish buyers have shown some interest in securing product with KemerovoAzot linked to the sale of 6- 8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent, although other market sources contend this level is too high.\\nFinland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.\\nAmmonium Nitrate/CAN\\nAN prices remain soft for yet another week, despite the increases in urea values registered in main markets such as Brazil and Turkey. The undertone in urea is also relatively firm for forward positions, but AN will remain overpriced in the short term as FSU producers try to maintain netbacks close to $190/mt FOB for AN while quoting urea a mere $10/mt higher.\\nDemand is subdued with the exception of some small quantities for North Africa. Turkish and Brazilian buyers appear content to stay sidelined until and unless prices match urea values more closely, with premiums for the nitrates within historical levels.\\nBuyers also point to the depressed market for UAN where sales from Egypt were made last week at $140/mt FOB. That number reflected urea values around $200/mt FOB on a pure nutrient basis, while Egyptian urea traded at the time at $224/mt FOB.\\nPrices for CAN in NW Europe remain under pressure on limited demand while supply is set to increase substantially in about two weeks when OCI is due to restart its Geleen plant.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes\\nUS UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.\\nUS NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm\\nMore and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.\\nMuch of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.\\nUS Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower\\nUAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.\\nThe driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.\\nAs a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: Bunge will be supplied by Nitron\\nReports from other participants in the session suggest that Nitron booked the recent Bunge requirement for 25,000 mt of UAN-32 for Argentina at $171/mt CFR.\\nThe origin of the cargo was not revealed, but indications from the freight-market are that the parcel may load from the US.\\nBunge\\'s prior purchase for Argentina was booked October 22 with EuroChem around the $220/mt CFR marker.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: November exports continue to head for the US\\nRussia exported 103,216 mt UAN-32 in November 2015, up 12% on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.\\nRussian exports to the US in November fell 4% to 87,894 mt, but still comprise 85% of Russian exports to the US. Ukraine was the second largest receiver of UAN from Russia in November 2015 at 15,024 mt, up from zero the previous year.\\nRussia was the largest global exporter of UAN in the January-November 2015 period, followed by Lithuania. Total Russian exports for the first 11 months of this year were 1.56 million mt, a 6% decline year-on-year. Again most of its UAN volumes were directed to the US (88% market share).\\nEUROPE\\nGermany: No deals reported, pipeline and tanks are full\\nThere has been no reported activity in the German UAN market in recent weeks as storage tanks and the pipeline are full. As such an assessement of no recent business has been applied to the €173-176/mt FCA\\nrange.\\nRouen: Prices plunge to €150-155/mt FCA\\nFrench UAN-30 prices fell sharply this week to €150-155/mt FCA for March/April positions.\\nThe French UAN market remains 90% covered for the season ending April as participants hold off from buying the remainder with a belief that prices have not yet reached their floor.\\nPrice ideas for May/June fell €10/mt to around €145/mt FCA.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir issues another UAN tender\\nAbu Qir issued a new export tender for 25,000 mt UAN closing February 8 for loading from Damietta February 11-15 dates.\\nThe producer is targeting a price of $140/mt FOB in this session following its 5,000 mt sale to Trammo at this level in its January 26 tender. Should the producer fail to sell its 25,000 mt, it may elect to cut UAN production.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Markets to remain quiet for the next fortnight\\nUpcoming Chinese New Year holidays are expected to create a lull in the UAN market until the end of February.\\nAccording to reports, Chinese UAN producers Jinkai and Huaihua will recommence limited production after the holidays to build up inventories until 40-50,000 mt of UAN is available for spot sale.\\nProducers suggest they will target $150/mt FOB in future sales but buyers contest they are looking for product priced nearer $145/mt FOB.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge\\nAfter the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.\\nMexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium\\nMexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.\\nTotal imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year.\\nMexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.\\nOff-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%.\\nDue to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January-November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Little interest in AS now\\nBrazilian demand for AS is slow as buying for the Safrinha crop continues to wind down. Offers for caprolactam grade AS from China are now reported available at the $130/mt CFR level although there is little business done.\\nSafrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20, due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This is expected to help boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: KemorovoAzot AS sale into Turkey\\nKemerovoAzot is linked to the sale of 6-8,000 mt caprolactam grade AS into Turkey, possibly to Gemlik. Reports at press time suggest business was concluded at $130/mt FOB equivalent although other market sources contend this level is too high.\\nRussia: Reduced availability prompts fall in exports\\nRussia AS exports for November 2015 were 32,189 mt, a 49% decrease on the prior year period.\\nTotal shipments for the January-November 2015 period reached 510,841 mt, a fall of 26% on reduced availability.\\nRussia exports to Ukraine during the first 11 months of this year were 178,083 mt, up 17% year-on-year.\\nShipments to Turkey for the period were 140,977 mt, down 40%.\\nExports to Brazil more than halved at 42,422 mt as\\nChina shipped more to the south American country.\\nEUROPE\\nFinland: Norilsk Nickel offering 6-8,000 mt AS\\nFinland’s Norilsk Nickel is reportedly in the freight market for 6-8,000 mt steel grade AS to load for prompt shipment from Pori to Samsun for Toros.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Interest in AS dries up\\nInterest in Chinese AS has dried up with producers in little hurry to sell before Chinese New Year celebrations. Last known sales for caprolactam grade AS were concluded in the $103-108/mt FOB range in recent weeks but product is now reported available at an even $100/mt FOB.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nSheenal Khimasia, Writer – Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2132\\nEmail: sheenal.khimasia@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.\\nYara’s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR surprised some regional traders who felt the drop in\\nvalues too sharp. Others argued that it accurately represented a market awash with supply as Sabic and\\nPetronas are still reported to have spot cargo available. It has also been suggested that Indonesia’s Pupuk\\nKaltim may switch from urea to greater ammonia output potentially compounding the ample supply situation, but this was not confirmed at the time of writing.\\nBASF China and FACT will certainly be hoping for lower offers in import tenders for 8,000 mt and 15,000 mt respectively which close February 5, after CJ Indonesia secured 6,000 mt spot cargo from Petrokimia Gresik\\nat $368/mt CFR. A number of Indian buyers claim recent offers to FACT at $410/mt CFR under scrapped tenders have kept suppliers’ price ideas unrealistically high with no new offers below the $340-360/mt CFR\\nrange for spot enquiries. CIL said it will hold out for ammonia values around $320/mt CFR before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.\\nBlack Sea suppliers contend that although the market remains tough in February/March, prices are stable at $260-270/mt FOB with no urgency to sell product. OPZ remains shut on one ammonia line as Ameropa busies itself with contract commitments. Sorfert continues to run just one ammonia line while Fertial is also reported to be running just one ammonia line in Arzew due to export licence issues.\\nDespite this, buyers appear reluctant to conclude spot business west of Suez should prices fall further, citing limited demand and low prices for other fertilizers. The market will watch with interest at what price Turkey’s\\nGemlik must offer at to spur buying interest for possible exports after restarting ammonia production this week.\\nMosaic\\'s announcement this week of a Q1 production cut of up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphates in the US was expected, and it naturally means the phosphate giant will need less ammonia through March. The timing means it is unlikely that international suppliers will be in a position to extract a price increase at Tampa for March deliveries. Somewhat surprisingly, while speculation of a possible production cut by Mosaic was rumoured for months, similar rumours have not emerged with regard to ammonia output in Trinidad and Tobago, the main supplier of ammonia to the US Gulf.\\nAmmonia producers have cut prices by $10-22/st in all key US enduser markets, although new quotes from suppliers vary somewhat even within regions. The move is likely aimed at making up for some of the lost demand seen last fall, when wet weather substantially reduced the application window for ammonia, especially in the Midwest.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙CJ Indonesia tender awarded to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR\\n∙BASF China closing 8,000 mt import tender February 5\\n∙Namhae buys 15,000 mt from Yara at $347/mt CFR\\n∙Pupuk Kaltim may reduce urea output in favour of ammonia\\n∙FACT issues 15,000mt retender closing February 5\\n∙Mitsui buys 3,000 mt KAFCO cargo under formula price\\n∙Sabic and Petronas may have spot cargo available\\n∙Turkey\\'s Gemlik restarts ammonia output\\n∙Fertial running one ammonia line at Arzew due to export licence issues\\n∙Black Sea quiet; prices stable at $260-270/mt FOB\\nShort term outlook\\nStability west of Suez although downwards price pressure remains. There is room for further falls east of Suez as buyers push for lower values on ample supply.\\nDAP versus ammonia\\nMosaic announced long awaited DAP/MAP production cuts this week as market prices again tumbled on weak demand and high stocks. The company plans to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns, which could ease the demand for ammonia.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand\\nA rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.\\nUS Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower\\nThere no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.\\nUS S. Plains: More aggressive offers\\nProducers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.\\nOrders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.\\nUS NOLA: Barge indications narrow\\nInland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week\\'s range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.\\nThe decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week\\'s range of $301-350/st FOB.\\nUS Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia\\nNot all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.\\nThere are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: November 2015 exports recover to 2013 levels\\nRussian ammonia exports for November 2015 were 300,009 mt, up on the 111,823 mt exported in the same period in 2014, and more or less in line with exports for 2013.\\nTotal exports for the January-November 2015 period were\\n3.2million mt, up 3% year-on-year boosted by increased shipments to Belgium and Finland.\\nThe largest recipient of Russian ammonia during the first 11 months of 2015 was Ukraine at 2.1 million mt, including product transported by pipeline to Odessa for export.\\nAnother 540,694 mt was destined to Belgium during the period, up 104%.\\nRussia exported 215,392 to Finland, up 9% on the prior year.\\nBlack Sea: No new trade; Ameropa charters Solaro\\nAnother quiet week in the Black Sea with values assessed stable at $260-270/mt FOB. Ameropa has chartered the Solaro for 2-3 months to cover freight requirements.\\nThe vessel is slated to arrive in Yuzhnyy February 18 to load 25,000 mt, possibly for GCT Tunisia.\\nKoch’s Clipper Orion sailed February 3 with 30,000 mt OPZ product and 10,000 mt from Ameropa for SFC\\nand Namhae in South Korea.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Gemlik restarts output\\nLocal reports suggest Gemlik restarted ammonia production this week after suspending output mid- December due to low AN values. It possible that Gemlik is now receiving cheaper gas compared with the end of 2015 due to gas contracts linked to lower oil values, making ammonia production more viable despite current prices pegged no higher than $300/mt CFR Turkey.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Fertial runs just one ammonia line\\nFertial is reported running just one ammonia line at Arzew following issues securing exports licences.\\nSorfert still has one ammonia down at its Arzew plant.\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic may have additional cargo\\nReports suggesting Sabic has an additional cargo outside contract commitments for March lifting have not been confirmed by the producer.\\nMeanwhile, it is suggested that Qafco is experiencing technical issues at Qafco IV.\\nMiddle East spot values have been assessed indicatively at $275-280/mt FOB on netbacks on Yara\\'s 15,000 mt sale to Namhae at $347/mt CFR, taking into account freight costs of around $70/mt.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBangladesh: Mitsui purchases 3,000 mt from KAFCO\\nMitsui purchased 3,000 mt spot cargo from KAFCO under a formula pricing arrangement for lifting on the Gashcem Dollart February 5-6. The cargo will be taken to Singapore where Mitsui has a contract supply agreement.\\nIndia: Iran ammonia imports down, but Qatar up\\nIndian ammonia imports in November 2015 were registered by customs at 197,542 mt, a 13% increase on the same period in the prior year on greater volumes sourced from Qatar and Russia via Ukraine.\\nTotal imports for the January-November 2015 period reached 1.9 million mt, an increase of 8% year-on year.\\nIndia sourced the majority of its ammonia during the first 11 months of this year from Iran at 575,334 mt, a 5% decrease on 2014.\\nImports from Qatar were 411,929 mt, up 22%, while off- take from Russia shipped via Ukraine leapt 73% to 376,807 mt.\\nIndia: FACT retender closes February 5\\nIndian importer FACT retenders February 5 for 15,000 mt ammonia to be delivered to Cochin in two lots late February and first half March. This follows the scrapping of its February 1 session which attracted no offers.\\nIts January 21 tender for the same volume was also scrapped as offers for the two lots by Trammo and Muntajat at an identical $410/mt CFR basis sight payment were considered substantially in excess of actual spot values.\\nCIL said it will wait for ammonia values to fall to $320/mt CFR or below before securing a small spot parcel for March delivery.\\nZuari said it shut down its ammonia and urea plants for maintenance from January 26, 2016. It is unclear how long the turnaround will last.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nTaiwan: CPDC continues to rule out spot cargp\\nCPDC is focusing on contract ammonia deliveries for the next month.\\nOperation rates at its Toufen caprolactam plant are now at 80% following mechanical problems reported last week. Its acrylonitrile plant continues to run at 90% of rated capacity.\\nAmmonia countract prices in the country are pegged at $370-380/mt CFR.\\nChina: BASF looking for ammonia spot cargo\\nShanghai BASF Polyurethane Company issued an import tender for 8,000 mt ammonia closing February 5 at 16:00hrs Singapore time. Delivery is requested in March 1-10 dates.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae secures additional cargoes\\nNamhae has secured 15,000 mt ammonia from Yara outside contract commitments for March 1-5 delivery at $347/mt CFR, around $20/mt below regional values posted last week.\\nAnother 13,000 mt additional cargo has been secured by Namhae from Koch for March 5-10 delivery likely off the Clipper Orion, with the parcel reported priced higher than the Yara deal.\\nSFC is not currently in the market for additional cargoes and will focus on contract commitments until early March at least.\\nKoch will discharge 27,000 mt off the Clipper Orion for SFC under an existing supply agreeement in March likely priced in the $360-370/mt CFR range.\\nIndonesia: Pupuk Kaltim may switch to more ammonia\\nThere were suggestions at the time of writing that Pupuk Kaltim may be considering switching from urea to greater ammonia output.\\nIndonesia: CJ Indonesia awards tender at $368/mt CFR\\nCJ Indonesia is reported to have awarded its 6,000 mt ammonia import tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $368/mt CFR.

With phosphates prices and sentiment collapsing in markets around the world, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best moment for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system. However, many sources think the cut does not go far enough and that it will remain a difficult task for producers to stabilise and possibly raise some DAP/MAP prices by the end of the first quarter.\\nMosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market. Without any new sales, the company\\'s DAP/MAP Tampa price is assessed at $350- 360/mt FOB. The US domestic benchmark at New Orleans remained essentially flat week over week.\\nIn the last two weeks more than 100,000 mt of spot MAP/DAP has been committed to the US between EuroChem and PhosAgro. These cargos are in addition to two 50,000 mt MAP/DAP cargos previously booked by Koch with OCP. Another international trader is shopping for Russian phosphates to load in February for the US if enough US buyers will commit to purchases.\\nThe Brazilian MAP market again saw declines this week as Indagro sold off further Saudi Arabian tonnage as low as $325/mt CFR. In the last two weeks, Brazil\\'s MAP import price has reduced by as much as $35/mt. Demand remains slow to build. Brazil\\'s consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to\\n4.4million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014 and imports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, according to new ANDA data. Most sources suspect that there could be further declines to go in Brazil but that such low levels are likely to encourage buying later in the quarter.\\nEuropean DAP prices also saw slight reductions this week. Demand for DAP is still slow across the continent and prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. EuroChem has sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets at around $410/mt FOB while GCT has sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB. JPMC and GCT likely each have around 100,000 mt DAP being stockpiled due to weak sales and their prices have reduced again to spur on activity.\\nIn early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe. Despite this, the Moroccan DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB due to market levels.\\nVast stocks of DAP continue to impact the market in India. There is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced. A 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this\\nweek for Blue Deebaj from Chinese producers, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR and Ma\\'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment. Traders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380- 395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.\\nExport levels from China further reduced this week as the lunar New Year approaches. The Malaysian National Farmer\\'s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR. While larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales at $390/mt FOB as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales as low as $368/mt FOB in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.\\nDespite the weaker price environment, Saudi Arabia\\'s Ma\\'aden confirmed over 210,000 mt of sales for the coming two months. The shipments include DAP sales to India, Southeast Asia and East Africa, an MAP sale to Australia and mixed DAP/MAP shipments under formula pricing to Brazil and Argentina/Uruguay. Prices for the DAP sales are quoted in the $380-400/mt FOB range. Sabic is currently indicating prices in the $370s/mt FOB and has postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March due to slow demand.\\nMosaic\\'s Q1 cutback seems unlikely to change much in the near term. Global stocks remain high and demand has yet to jump in major markets. Sentiment has reduced significantly in recent weeks leading PhosAgro\\'s chief executive Andrey Guryev to say this week that DAP prices are likely to fall a further 10% in the next few weeks. Suppliers hope that the Mosaic cut, coupled with a return in demand for a range of markets at the end of Q1 can offset the recent price pressure.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Mosaic to cut DAP/MAP production by up to 400,000 mt in Q1\\n∙US Gulf Tampa DAP/MAP spot declines to $350-360/mt FOB\\n∙Brazil MAP spot price declines to $325-340/mt CFR on new sales\\n∙Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot declines to $340-410/mt FOB\\n∙Ma\\'aden makes over 210,000 mt DAP/MAP sales for Feb/March\\n∙Sabic postpones DAP/MAP availability to March\\n∙North Africa DAP spot declines to $400-430/mt FOB\\n∙China DAP spot declines to $368-378/mt FOB on SE Asia sales\\n∙GCT and JPMC expected to have around 100,000 mt DAP stocks\\n∙Fertinal confirms new Australia MAP sale, DAP/MAP price declines to $370/mt FOB\\n∙PhosAgro expects further 10% decline in DAP prices\\n∙JPMC confirms new phosphate rock contracts at reduced prices\\n∙New tenders: BCIC for 10k Phosacid and Kenya for 68k NPK\\nSulphur\\nThere were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq\\'s $30/mt reduction of its Qatar sulphur price to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its official selling price to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.\\nAmmonia\\nFurther falls are noted east of Suez as buyers push for values closer to the Tampa February number of $310/mt CFR. Reports of ample supply in the region are helping their cause with suppliers seemingly left with little choice but to concede discounts to stimulate March sales.\\nAgricultural Developments\\nWheat prices moved lower this week, on reduced export demand, but offset by small gains in corn, soybean and rice prices.\\nSoybean harvest in Brazil has progressed beyond 4% completion, according to Ag Rural. Combine Harvesting in Mato Grosso was seen at 8% complete (11% same time last year). Reported yields have so far been mixed, and the USDA attaché in Brazil this week lowered their soybean production forecast to 98 million mt. This remains a record volume, but below the 100 million mt originally forecast.\\nSafrinha corn plantings are now over 3% complete in Mato Grosso and Parana. Plantings are expected to be pushed beyond the ideal planting window, which ends February 20. This is due to unprecedented forward sales and current record high prices. This will help to boost nearby farm fertilizer demand, draining some pipeline inventories.\\nCrop conditions in Argentina have turned dryer over the past two weeks. If this dry period is extended, yields of both soybeans and corn may be impacted, as both crops are in critical development stages.\\nRice prices in Thailand increased to a six month high this week. Low water availabilities added some worries to the upcoming cropping season and may be detrimental to fertilizer demand.\\nWheat planting in India inched higher through the week, with planted area now 29.3 million hectares, 5% below the same time last year.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest\\nDAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week\\'s postings.\\nUS Tampa: No new exports again\\nMosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil\\'s market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.\\nThis week\\'s drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.\\nUS NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut\\nAt the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.\\nOn average, this week\\'s DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.\\nMeanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.\\nUSA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts\\nMosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.\\nMosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.\\nSome traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.\\nNevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.\\nUS Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices\\nModest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.\\nOver the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal\\nFertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.\\nThe company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.\\nFertinal\\'s current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015\\nMexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.\\nMAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.\\nTSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.\\nIn December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: DAP/MAP imports up 7% Jan-Nov\\nColombia imported 303,832 mt DAP/MAP between January and November 2015, a 7% increase on the same period 2014, according to GTIS.\\nBetween January and November, Colombia imported 160,120 mt DAP, 12% more than the same period a year earlier. During the 11 months, Colombia imported 134,827 mt from the US, 7% higher than the 125,900 mt in 2014, while Chinese producers increased import volumes to 19,075 mt from 9,281 mt.\\nColombia\\'s MAP imports reached 143,172 mt, a slight increase from 140,541 mt in the same period a year ago. US shipments fell to 123,571 mt from 127,983 mt, while imports from China rose to 16,938 mt from just 8,073 mt in 2014.\\nBrazil: Indagro sells MAP at $325/mt CFR\\nIndagro is rumoured to have sold a further 5,000 mt Saudi MAP to Fertipar at the reduced price of $325/mt CFR.\\nThe news follows sales late last week from Indagro with Saudi MAP in the $330s/mt CFR. As a result, the Brazilian market is now quoted in the $325-340/mt CFR range.\\nSome sources believe the sale clears all tonnage on Indagro\\'s recent formula vessel with Saudi Arabian product.\\nThis week, Ma\\'aden has confirmed a further DAP/MAP cargo to Brazil under formula pricing with February or March shipment.\\nRecent sales for Latin America to traders or distribution channels by OCP, Saudi producers and PhosAgro have hit the market in another demand glut and Brazilian MAP prices plummeted.\\nMany suspect that the reduced prices, along with recent news that new credit will be made available to farmers as early as February, should boost demand by the end of the month or into March, which should at least stabilise the current price fall\\nBrazil: Full year P2O5 consumption down 7.4%\\nBrazil\\'s consumption of all P2O5 products in the full year 2015 fell to 4.4 million mt from 4.8 million mt in 2014, according to ANDA data.\\nImports of MAP to Brazil fell 23% to 2.3 million mt during the year, DAP imports fell to 395,000 mt from 739,000 mt, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt from 938,000 mt and SSP imports fell to 564,000 mt from 608,000 mt.\\nDespite the reduced consumption and imports, domestic production of some granular phosphate products increased. MAP production rose 4% to 654,000 mt while SSP production rose 3% to 910,000 mt. However, TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.\\nArgentina: DAP prices reduce on market prices\\nSources from Argentina indicate that the recent collapse in Brazilian MAP prices has in turn reduced the expectations for DAP prices to Latin America.\\nAs a result, the Argentina DAP spot price has been indicatively reduced to $360-370/mt CFR pending new deals.\\nMa\\'aden has confirmed a further 50,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo to Argentina/Uruguay under formula pricing with February or March shipment.\\nFollowing the recent change of leadership in Argentina, many sources at FLA Colombia were buoyant that Argentine fertilizer buying will recover over the coming years after declines under the previous leadership.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Prices decline further on new sales\\nEuroChem sold its 10,000 mt DAP remaining for February shipment from Lifosa to northern European markets.\\nLast DAP sales to Northern Europe are believed to have been around $410/mt FOB.\\nThere are expectations from some sources that northern European bids may have fallen to as low as $410- 415/mt FCA, but EuroChem is still holding its Lifosa DAP prices at around $410/mt FOB.\\nThe company is planning a turnaround at the Lifosa plant for around three weeks starting in March, which is likely to reduce normal DAP tonnage by 40-50,000 mt.\\nEuroChem is also believed to have sold a 40,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo from Kingisepp to the US or Latin America but prices are currently unconfirmed.\\nThe sale would leave EuroChem with around 20,000 mt DAP and 60,000 mt MAP remaining from Kingisepp for February shipment.\\nEuroChem had said it may seek to reduce DAP/MAP production if prices remain depressed in Brazil but the company has yet to make any extra production cuts.\\nLast week, PhosAgro sold a 24,000 mt DAP cargo to Turkey\\'s Igsas at $390/mt CFR with duty unpaid and likely 270 days credit.\\nBased on current market prices and the new sales the Baltic/Black Sea DAP spot price has declined to $340-410/mt FOB and the Baltic/Black Sea MAP price has fallen to $330-340/mt FOB.\\nRussia: PhosAgro CEO sees more falls in fert prices\\nThe current decline in fertilizer prices is likely to continue, likely driving some high-cost Chinese producers out of business, PhosAgro\\'s chief executive officer told Reuters on February 4.\\nPrices for phosphate, potash and nitrogen fertilizers are likely to weaken by at least another 10% in the next few weeks, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Guryev said.\\nHigh stocks, weaker currencies, lower commodity prices and limited demand in a range of markets have dragged down fertilizer prices, but Guryev said a further fall may push out some Chinese producers, helping to ease those stocks and lift prices later in 2016.\\n\"Sometimes, it is quite positive for the market to drop one level down because that is the only way to find a lift which will take you up,\" Guryev said.\\nPrices for DAP may decline by 10% to $320/mt on an FOB basis but would likely recover to around $400/mt FOB later in the year, he added.\\nPhosAgro increased output by 1 million mt in the last two years to 6.8 million mt and plans to continue growing production.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: DAP market prices reduce slightly\\nDemand for DAP is still slow in Europe but prices are quoted at the reduced level of around $425/mt FCA across northern Europe. Sources indicate that European buying may build later in Q1.\\nEuroChem have sold the final 10,000 mt DAP from Lifosa left for February shipment to northern European markets.\\nIn early January, OCP failed to continue to achieve its price goal of $450/mt FOB in Europe. As a result its allocation of DAP for European markets was reduced to 50,000 mt from 80-100,000 mt. The company continues to hold around the same price level and notes that it will manage its DAP allocation to demand and not accept current low prices in Europe.\\nDespite this, based on current global market DAP prices, the Moroccan spot DAP price has been indicatively reduced to $420-430/mt FOB pending new sales.\\nGCT and JPMC are offering around $400-420/mt FOB to Europe in February, with GCT confirmed to have sold 3,000-4,000 mt DAP to Italy at $420/mt FOB.\\nSome sources note that new bids from European buyers have reduced to the $390-410/mt CFR range.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic postpones sales as prices fall\\nSabic postponed DAP/MAP availability to the beginning of March as demand remains weak across key markets.\\nSabic says its price ideas are now $370-380/mt FOB.\\nMa\\'aden have confirmed a range of shipments for the next two months totalling around 210,000 mt DAP/MAP.\\nThe company has confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with a likely netback of around $385/mt FOB RAK and a 15-20,000 mt DAP sale to East Africa at around $400/mt FOB RAK.\\nIn addition, Ma\\'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK.\\nThe company has two mixed DAP/MAP cargoes to Latin America (one shipment to Brazil and one to Argentina/Uruguay) at formula pricing totalling around 100,000 mt. Ma\\'aden also has signed a 40,000 mt shipment, likely MAP, to Australia also at formula pricing.\\nMa\\'aden has also signed government-to-government agreements with Bangladesh for granular phosphate shipments in 2016 and plans to start executing sales in the next 1-2 months.\\nDAP prices are currently assessed at $370-395/mt FOB from Saudi Arabian producers.\\nSaudi Arabian MAP has recently been sold in Brazil by Indagro in the $325-340/mt CFR range.\\nJordan: Sales still slow, indicative prices decline\\nThere are no confirmed new DAP sales from Jordan this week and with market prices falling dramatically, the Jordan export price has also dropped on an indicative basis.\\nThe country exported just 25,000 mt DAP of its 80,000 mt allocation for the combined months of December and January and is likely to now have around 100,000 mt DAP in stock.\\nJPMC plans to carry out a month-long turnaround at its operations in March.\\nWith indications that new European levels may have slipped below $420/mt CFR and following the news of a Russian cargo to Turkey at $390/mt CFR, the Jordan DAP export price has declined on an indicative basis to $400/mt FOB.\\nTunisia: Prices reduce on low demand, high stocks\\nGCT sold 3-4,000 mt DAP of its February allocation to Italy at around $420/mt FOB, but new offers to these markets are believed to now be around the $400/mt FOB level.\\nFollowing recent DAP sales from Russia to Turkey at $390-395/mt CFR, GCT may be offering as low at $380/mt FOB to the Turkish market, although this is not confirmed.\\nCurrently Tunisian prices are assessed in an indicative range of $400-420/mt FOB pending further deals.\\nGCT sold around 40,000 mt of its 60,000 mt DAP allocation in both December and January. The company is still believed to still be operating at around 60% of its 110,000 mt/month capacity and GCT\\'s DAP stocks are currently quoted at around 100,000 mt.\\nMorocco: DAP prices hit more pressure\\nOCP continues to hold DAP prices at $440-450/mt FOB to Europe without any new sales, but the current market has dropped significantly and Moroccan export prices have been decreased to an indicative $420- 430/mt FOB.\\nMorocco cut its allocation for Europe in January to 50,000 mt from an expectation of 80-100,000 mt after further price declines across the continent. The company is planning for another 80-100,000 mt DAP/MAP sales to Europe in February, but says it will reduce this level again if necessary.\\nThe company\\'s DAP FOB values have likely been boosted by sales to African markets. OCP is aiming for 200-250,000 mt DAP/NPK/NPS shipments to African markets in February, including at least one shipment to Ethiopia, and is looking to sell 25-30,000 mt DAP/NPK into its domestic market.\\nHowever, there are indications that European DAP prices have fallen to as low as $390-430/mt CFR and OCP may soon be forced to make sales at further-reduced levels. On the other hand, OCP\\'s strategy may help limit the current price declines before a possible demand return in some markets later in Q1.\\nOCP also plans to send a further DAP/MAP panamax to the US during February, but there are no February shipments planned to its distribution channel in Brazil without some improvement in consumption.\\nThe Moroccan MAP price has been lowered to $400/mt FOB, but with no recent sales in Europe and Latin American levels indicating a netback around $70/mt below this, the level is likely to decline further.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: No activity as Fauji begins production\\nFauji has now finished the two-week turnaround at its Port Qasim plant and returned to granular phosphate production.\\nThere are no new reported DAP imports to Pakistan. With higher than normal stocks and the possibility of reduced consumption in Q1, there are unlikely to be significant imports of DAP during the period.\\nBased on indications from India and recent prices from Pakistan, the DAP price has reduced to an indicative level of $395/mt CFR with further downward pressure.\\nIndia: Glut in demand reduces indicated prices\\nIndian DAP importers are struggling to sell on vast stocks and there is little import business expected until the end of Q1 when new Nutrient Based Subsidy rates are announced.\\nOne 15,000 mt DAP vessel arrived this week from a Chinese producer to Blue Deebaj, which was previously reported at around $390-395/mt CFR, although the price was not confirmed.\\nMa\\'aden has also confirmed a 33,000 mt DAP shipment to India at around $395/mt CFR with February or March shipment.\\nTraders and importers are now assessing DAP prices at $370-380/mt CFR based on global prices after recent reductions in other markets. Current Indian DAP prices are assessed in the $380-395/mt CFR range with downward pressure.\\nMost companies are expecting the DAP subsidy to be cut in a range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt ($29-44). The government may also force producers/importers to reduce the maximum retail price along with the subsidy reduction.\\nMany companies have revised DAP MRP\\'s to INR 23,700-23,800/mt since January from INR 23,700- 24,000/mt in order to match with IFFCO\\'s recent price reduction to INR 23,700/mt.\\nAt current MRP levels and exchange rates, DAP importers are believed to have a breakeven level of around $365-375/mt CFR if the subsidy is cut in the range of INR 2,000-3,000/mt. If there is a significant reduction in the MRP as well, this level may reduce by as much as $15-25/mt.\\nDAP stocks remain at the very high level of 2-2.5 million mt and domestic DAP production levels are returning to normal levels after the recent reduction in phosacid prices. As a result, there are unlikely to be significant DAP imports until at least the end of Q1.\\nAlthough unconfirmed, a major domestic tender for 80,000 mt DAP in the Punjab region is believed to have received offers as much as $50/mt below the current import price assessment as suppliers and importers\\nattempt to clear stocks. As a result, current sentiment is that DAP import prices for India have to reduce further but that even massive price reductions are unlikely to spur on import activity for quite some time.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: FOB levels reduce as Golden Week approaches\\nNew sales from Hubei producers and falls in market DAP prices have reduced the current Chinese FOB levels ahead of next week\\'s New Year holidays.\\nChinese producers are believed to have secured sales to Southeast Asia this week. The Malaysian National Farmer\\'s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR from a Chinese producer while a Thai buyer is believed to have purchased 15,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer, although this is not confirmed. The Thai buyer had asked for $380/mt CFR.\\nMarket DAP prices in India are now indicatively assessed as low as the $380/mt CFR level with downward pressure and little buying activity expected during the first quarter.\\nAs a result, Chinese export DAP prices are assessed in the $368-$378/mt FOB range although many of the larger producers continue to hold levels at around $390/mt FOB and are focusing on the domestic market.\\nWhile larger producers have reduced some production and are holding export sales as they await the domestic season, smaller producers in Hubei have had to make export sales in a time of little demand in order to keep up revenues, which has dragged down export prices.\\nThe domestic market for DAP remains slow and has now effectively stopped with all of the transport systems in use for mass migration during the Chinese New Year holidays.\\nDespite this, domestic prices remain stable on a price guarantee basis this week and most sources expect that the domestic market will see at least a month\\'s worth of strong buying activity after the New Year, keeping much of the Chinese DAP out of export markets until around April.\\nRegarding MAP, Chinese producers have managed to keep up some export sales to the ongoing seasonal buying in Australia but there are no new exports to Brazil. Chinese producers have no current plans to send to Brazil as current market prices are too low compared to their domestic market or the Australian sales.\\nThe domestic MAP market also remains largely inactive with many NPK plants already announcing that they have completed their sourcing of raw materials for upcoming production after the Chinese holidays. Activity should increase following the New Year.\\nAustralia: MAP prices quoted relatively high\\nIndications from the Australian MAP market imply that prices in the on-going buying season are currently at significantly better netbacks to suppliers than the weak levels seen in Brazil.\\nChina\\'s Wengfu and YTH are believed to still be sending MAP to their distribution channels in Australia and sources quote prices for MAP at around $390/mt CFR.\\nMexico\\'s Fertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The cargo is priced on a formula.\\nHigh competition is reportedly taking place for sales in Australia, with more Chinese producers recently achieving Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) recognition, adding to the number of companies accepted to export granular phosphates to Australia.\\nAs a result, other countries which export to Australia, such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia, are expected to have lost market share to Chinese producers during the season.\\nRegarding exports, there are no new sales reported from Australia\\'s Incitec Pivot but with new price ideas reducing across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, export DAP prices have reduced on an indicative basis to $370-380/mt FOB.\\nSoutheast Asia: Nafas gets DAP in $380s/mt CFR\\nThe Malaysian National Farmer’s Association (Nafas) is reported to have purchased 3,000 mt DAP in the $380s/mt CFR.\\nThe DAP is believed to be of Chinese origin and is likely to be for prompt shipment, although this is not confirmed.\\nIt is unclear whether the 15,000 mt DAP asked for by a Thai buyer last week has been purchased. The buyer asked for $380/mt CFR. A Thai buyer recently purchased 10,000 mt DAP from a Chinese producer at $388/mt CFR.\\nIn addition, Ma\\'aden has agreed a 22,000 mt DAP sale to a Southeast Asian buyer at $390/mt FOB RAK or around $400/mt CFR with February or March shipment.

According to ANDA, TSP imports fell to 868,000 mt in full year 2015 from 938,000 mt previously while TSP production fell 6% to 406,000 mt.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Plans advance for phosphate complexes\\nEgypt is advancing plans to develop its phosphates sector with two major new complexes, the first of which is scheduled to begin construction this month.\\nBoth projects are driven by a government shift away from exporting raw materials and a new focus on the increased value of downstream products.\\nThe El Wady complex, the least advanced of the two projects, is due to be incorporated in the coming weeks after completing its pre-feasibility study last year. The joint venture between Misr Phosphate and Abu Qir and will be constructed in two phases, with the first to focus on the production of phosphoric acid.\\nAbout 3.1 million mt of rock is required and \"secured at preferential prices,\" according to the prospectus. The project \"will be heavily supported by the Egyptian government\".\\nProduction of 518,000 mt/year phosphoric acid (MGA) is planned for Phase 1, all for export. Part of the phosacid production will be used in Phase 2 to produce 345,000 mt/year DAP/MAP, with the rest (about 207,000 mt P2O5 exported). Phase 3 is production of about 345,000 mt/year TSP.\\nThe investment cost is estimated at $1.05 billion and strategic investors are now being sought, with the project\\'s sponsors aiming to retain a 40% stake.\\nIn November President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi approved the construction of El Nasr Co. for Intermediate Chemicals\\' phosphate and compound fertilizers complex at Ain Sokhna.\\nIt will produce DAP, MAP, TSP, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid (see Fertilizer Week on January 16, 2015), with the fertilizers destined for the domestic market with surplus production available for export.

These rates are unchanged from 2015 and are significantly below free market interest rates, which are thought to be over 20%.\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nPemex finalises Fertinal takeover\\nPemex has completed its acquisition of Fertinal in Mexico, with longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Fabio Covarrubias of the phosphate producer confirming he has handed over control this week.\\nIn a letter to Fertinal employees, Covarrubias said government controlled petrochemical giant Pemex was in a position to make the phosphate operation on Mexico’s west coast more vertically integrated thanks to Pemex’s ammonia capacity. This in turn should move Fertinal back into the list of low-cost phosphate\\nproducers, he said.\\nThe takeover will cost Pemex around $680-690 million, according to Mexican media reports.\\nThe sale of Fertinal has been a subject of industry speculation for much of the last two decades. Ultimately this deal may prove to be more of a signal about Pemex\\'s intentions for its nitrogen assets than anything else.\\nPemex controls Petroquimica Cosoleacaque, with nearly 900,000 mt ammonia capacity on Mexico\\'s east coast, although the units do not run at capacity. The lack of competitive ammonia freight to Mexico\\'s west coast versus competing supplies from Trinidad and Venezuela mean the Pemex subsidiaries are not in a position to routinely supply Fertinal.\\nHowever, now that Pemex owns Fertinal it should be be easier to arbitrage deliveries to the west coast, as a way to reduce costs of delivering ammonia to the DAP, MAP and TSP producer.\\nPRODUCTION\\nPhosAgro fertilizer production increases 10%\\nRussian producer PhosAgro increased its total fertilizer production by 10.4% to 6.8 million mt in 2015, the company reports.\\nDespite a fall in commodity prices during 2015, phosphate-based fertilizer and MCP feed phosphates production rose by 12% during the period to 5.4 million mt.\\nPhosAgro\\'s DAP/MAP production rose 12% to 2.6 million mt while NPK production increased 11% to 1.9 million mt. NPS production rose 10% to 272,800 mt.\\nSeparately, phosphate rock production rose 4.7% to 7.9 million mt while phosphoric acid production as a feedstock increased 9.3% to 2.1 million mt.\\nRegarding nitrogen output, AN production rose 56% to 455,300 mt and urea production rose 1.3% to 978,000 mt. Ammonia production for feedstock use declined 5.8% to 1.1 million mt.\\nOverall sales volumes for phosphate-based fertilizers and MCP rose by 12% to 5.3 million mt but sales volumes of nitrogen-based fertilizers fell 1.4% to 1.4 million mt.\\nDespite some issues with demand at the start of 2015 in the Russian domestic market, PhosAgro still managed to have flat sales volumes to the domestic market during the year at 1.6 million mt of fertilizer. The company is optimistic that government support for agricultural production in Russia could boost sales in 2016.\\nRegarding exports, the company increased its overall fertilizer sales to Europe by over 30% to 1.3 million mt and hopes to achieve further sales in 2016. Sales to India increased dramatically, partly as a result of PhosAgro\\'s new contract to IPL for NPK and DAP.\\nHowever, sales to the Latin American markets reduced due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Although the price falls within the low end of last week\\'s range, other indications suggest that some pressure still remains as the tender season winds down.\\nVietnamese MOP prices continue to hold at the upper end of the range at $295/mt CFR although this could change in the coming weeks with Vietnam’s application season nearing. If demand in the country increases, some suppliers may attempt to push for higher prices, increasing the width of the region’s assessed range.\\nSome major global suppliers were hoping to talk business with Brazilian importers at last week’s FLA conference in Cartagena, Colombia but those meetings did not take place. Indications are that the price in Brazil is stable this week but confirmed deals in the $230s/mt CFR could be seen within the month if demand does not accelerate, as some traders expect it to do between now and March.\\nIndian importers are now expecting potash subsidy rate cuts of $22-29/mt, which would further add to their\\narguments for a significantly decreased 2016 contract price. According to sources, many traders are anticipating it to be agreed at between $240-270/mt CFR. Given the country’s 1.6-1.8 million mt inventory\\nlevel, this would not be surprising and negotiations could be noticeably delayed, following as similar trend to those in China.\\nIn China, the port wholesale price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200/mt FCA in the lead up to New Year festivities. Once contract talks begin, likely at the end of February, negotiations will be slow because the country does not need to bring in any foreign tonnes over the next couple months.\\nUS potash values held relatively steady with only a modest decline reported at New Orleans for imported barges. In the Midwest, modest movement from distributors to retailers and to the fields continued this week thanks to hard ground. These pre-spring applications of potash (and phosphates) are typical this time of year. This suggests Q1 demand in the key US corn and soybean growing region of the Midwest will be in line with prior years.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Japan December MOP imports down 51% y-o-y\\n∙Malaysia MOP price sees $5/mt decrease\\n∙Brazil January through September imports down 8% y-o-y\\n∙US NOLA barge prices assessed lower\\n∙Indian importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts\\n∙Colombia November MOP imports up 44% y-o-y\\n∙Mexico November MOP imports down 72% y-o-y\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the\\nspread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barge offers drift lower\\nImported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week\\'s range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.\\nMexico: November MOP imports down 72%\\nMexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.\\nOf this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.\\nThe month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more\\nthan in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.\\nSQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015,\\ncompared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.\\nUS Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings\\nNew granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: November MOP imports up 44%\\nColombia imported 50,657 mt of MOP in November, a 44% increase from the same month in 2014, according to the latest GTIS data.\\nK+S shipped 28,829 mt to the Latin American country in November, up from 4,885 mt in November 2014. The remainder of the tonnes were shipped by Uralkali (12,760 mt) and Canpotex (7,061 mt).\\nJanuary through November, Colombia imported 516,087 mt MOP, a 13% increase from the same period in\\n2014. Uralkali, the country’s largest supplier, shipped 234,584 mt during the 11 months of 2015, compared to\\n169,617 mt in 2014.\\nColombia also imported 175,464 mt from Canpotex and 76,107 mt from K+S, with the former decreasing shipments by 5% and the latter increasing shipments by 69% from the same period of the previous year.\\nBrazil: Jan-Dec MOP imports down 8% y-o-y\\nBrazil imported 292,489 mt of MOP in December, down from the 657,396 mt it received in the same month of 2014, according to Anda data.\\nCanpotex was the country’s largest supplier with a market share of 35% for the month. BPC supplied 25% of\\nthe imported product, while 14% came from Uralkali and 13% from K+S, according to GTIS data.\\nIn the full year of 2015, Brazil imported 8.3 million mt MOP, a decrease of 8% compared to the 12 months of 2014. Of this, 34% of the tonnes were imported via Canpotex.\\nOther January through December shipment shares were held by BPC (20%), Uralkali (17%) and K+S (15%). Brazil imported the remainder of the full-year volumes from ICL and SQM, a total market share of around 12%.\\nPotash consumption in Brazil was up slightly in December compared to the same month of 2014. It totalled 327,501 mt, a year-on-year increase of 4%, according to Anda. However, consumption in the full year of 2015 was 5.2 million mt, down 4% from the 12 months of 2014.\\nBrazil’s MOP production in December was 28,113\\nmt, a minor decrease on the December 2014 level of 29,147 mt. The country therefore produced 279,138 mt in the full year of 2015, down just over 2% from 2014.\\nSome major potash suppliers were hoping to conduct business with Brazilian importers at last week’s\\nconference in Cartagena but this did not happen. There are now expectations that demand, and subsequently trading, will increase in March.\\nThe business price range in Brazil remains $240- 250/mt CFR and demand is still weak, sources say. There has been a lack of indications to suggest that prices in the $230s/mt CFR deserve to form part of the range, despite previous suggestions of deals at $235/mt CFR.\\nOn a positive note, some sources have said that farmers are starting to make more money off of their trading, which could contribute towards increased demand later on in Q1. Producers are also reportedly attempting to work with partners in the country who are not bankrupt in an attempt to make more regular agreements.\\nThe Brazil granular bulk MOP spot price is assessed stable at $240-250/mt CFR.\\nEUROPE\\nSoutheast Asia: Slight price drop following pressure\\nThe assessed range for the Southeast Asia MOP spot price has been lowered to $255-295/mt CFR following reports of continued market pressure last week.\\nPrices across the region were said to be stable with the exception of Malaysia, where indications ranged from $250-260/mt CFR. According to one seller, business can be seen at as low as $250/mt CFR although there are no confirmed deals below this low end.\\nOne major supplier confirmed a February vessel bound for Malaysia with 30,000 mt standard MOP at a price of around $260/mt CFR. There are no confirmed tenders to report in the region as the season nears its end but there could be two more that have yet to be announced, sources say.\\nIndonesian prices are still higher than in Malaysia at around $270-280/mt CFR based on most indications but there are no new deals to report.\\nIn Vietnam, the high end of the current range has reportedly been maintained by suppliers despite previous suggestions that it would slip. Shipments are expected to start arriving in February, in line with the application season. Standard MOP is still seen at around $295/mt CFR, with granular priced at around $315/mt CFR, according to sources.\\nEurope: Demand remains weak as buying season looms\\nThe granular MOP buying season in northwest Europe is expected to start in the next few weeks although farmers in the region remain relatively inactive for now, according to sources.\\nRecent rainfall in the Benelux countries has not helped the current lack of business as farmers have not been using fertilizers. Potash demand remains low, partially because farmers are in no rush to consider application.\\nThere could be a slight rise in granular MOP prices once demand increases but this is not likely to happen until the buying season begins, sources say.\\nAt the beginning of January, some product was flowing freely because it was ready to be transported. However, warehouses then filled, resulting in pressure on prices as producers described the need to try to move tonnes. It now appears as though previous discounted offers have failed to spur demand.\\nThe northwest Europe granular MOP market is assessed unchanged again this week at €280-290/mt CIF\\nwith no new confirmed business to report.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSouth Africa: December MOP imports down 41%\\nSouth Africa imported 40,263 mt of MOP in December, 41% less than it did in the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nChile’s SQM supplied 31,401 mt of this, 23% more than in November 2014. The lower monthly import volume can be attributed to decreased K+S shipments, which totalled 8,796 mt in November compared to 20,500 mt in November 2014.\\nIn the full year of 2015, South Africa imported 377,367 mt of MOP, a meagre 1% drop from 2014 volumes. Of this, SQM shipped 135,362 mt, an increase of just 1,000 mt compared to 2014.\\nOther shipments throughout the 12 months were received from APC (90,800 mt), K+S (86,622 mt), Uralkali (41,950 mt) and ICL (17,566 mt).\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Importers expect higher subsidy rate cuts\\nPotash importers in India are now expecting 2016-17 subsidy rate cuts of INR 1,500-2,000 ($22-29)/mt, according to sources.\\nThis, combined with potential discounts on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) in the country, may result in low breakeven prices for importers, given current ideas that the 2016 contract will be agreed at somewhere between $240-270/mt CFR.\\nIf subsidy rates are cut by $22-29/mt, importers’ breakeven would be around $225-230/mt CFR, taking MRP decreases and a US dollar to INR ratio of 1:68 into account.\\nAlternatively, if the subsidy rates were cut by the same range and there was a further INR 1,000 ($15)/mt decrease on the MRP of INR 16,000 ($237)/mt CFR, then importers would have a breakeven of as low as $215-225/mt CFR after considering capital requirements for four to six months due to the high inventory level.\\nGiven how low these potential breakeven prices are next to the expected range of the new contract, importers would likely try to maintain margins through reducing MOP discounts.\\nPotash inventories were estimated to be 1.6-1.8 million mt as of the end of January. As a result, most suppliers are continuing to offer heavy discounts in the range of INR 2,500-3,000 ($37-45)/mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Lunar New Year approach slows activity\\nThe Chinese MOP port wholesale spot price is assessed unchanged at RMB 1,980-2,200 ($301-335)/mt\\nFCA as the country’s residents prepare for New Year festivities.\\nIt has become increasingly evident that negotiations over the new contract price will be difficult this year. They are expected to start at the end of February.\\nLarge suppliers across the global markets are waiting for the benchmark that the new contract will establish, but there will be little news to report on this front over the couple weeks.\\nIn the full year 2015, China imported more than 9 million mt of MOP for the first time since 2007. Much of this tonnage will need to be sold on before a formal agreement to bring in regular shipments over the next year is agreed.\\nJapan: Dec MOP imports down 51% y-o-y\\nJapan imported 19,150 mt of MOP in December, a decrease of 51% from the same month of 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nOf this amount, 8,239 mt were received from BPC, which increased its monthly market share to 43% from just 6% in 2014. Uralkali shipped 5,509 mt, up from 2,805 mt, while Canpotex decreased its shipments to just 1,536 mt from 16,174 mt in December 2014.\\nThe December tonnes bring Japan’s full year 2015 import volume to 494,113 mt, down from 534,365 mt in the full year of 2014. Canpotex remained the country’s largest supplier despite decreasing its shipments by\\n11% year on year to 346,959 mt.\\nOther full year 2015 imported volumes were from Uralkali (43,065 mt), BPC (40,761 mt) and K+S (27,546 mt).\\nPhilippines: October MOP imports more than triple\\nThe Philippines imported 16,081 mt of MOP in October 2015, according to the latest customs data via GTIS. The amount is up from 5,853 mt in October 2014.\\nCanpotex, the largest Phillippines\\' largest supplier, shipped 12,027 mt in October, a 75% increase from the same month of the previous year.\\nBetween January and October, the Philippines imported 129,095 mt of MOP, up from 106,739 mt from the same period in 2014. Of this, 61,724 mt arrived via Canpotex.\\nNEWS\\nENVIRONMENT\\nK+S cuts saline waste production by 50%\\nK+S cut its saline waste water production by 50% at the end of 2015, in line with the timing of its original goal to do so, according to a company press statement.\\nThe potash producer said that it invested about €400 million ($437.2 million) in new facilities in order to\\nreduce the amount of saline waste that it was creating in Germany to 7 million cubic metres.\\n“Water protection is an integral part of our sustainable potash production and an important condition for the preservation of almost 4,500 jobs in the Werra-Fulda potash district,” K+S Managing Director Dr Rainer\\nGerling said.\\nFurther measures are expected through to 2017 via the Hessen state government’s four-phase disposal plan, which will further reduce waste water production by 1.5 million cubic metres per year.\\nIn December, K+S was given the permission to continue with limited injections of waste at one of its potash plants into the Werra river until December 21 by the Kassel Regional Council. This was even though\\nthe authority is not expected to complete its technical assessment of the company’s waste disposal until the summer of 2016.\\nLogan Collins, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2020\\nEmail: logan.collins@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Many traders had already left on holiday, and the outlook for prices following the Spring Festival holidays will depend largely on how much product sellers push onto the market, as buyers in China are likely to need some tonnes for the domestic fertilizer season.\\nSome in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR. Demand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels. India’s\\nNovember 2015 imports increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.\\nMeanwhile, the announcement of production cuts at Mosaic’s US phosphate operations provided another\\nbearish demand signal.\\nIn contract news, Russian suppliers and Morocco’s OCP failed to reach a consensus and will therefore not settle Q1 contracts. Morocco’s other contracts settled so far have been reported ranging from the low $90s/mt to the mid-$110s/mt CFR, while Russia’s other contracts with North Africa were reportedly in the\\nupper $110s/mt CFR.\\nRussia’s November 2015 exports plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months of the year\\ndown 29% at 2.62 million mt.\\nFurther European Q1 contracts were reported settled at decreases of $5/mt, though in some cases buyers continued to push for greater declines.\\nIn other trade news, Kazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt,\\nleaving full-year imports down 21% to 2.75 million mt.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Chinese prices drop further\\n∙China\\'s imports climb 17% in 2015\\n∙Indian buyers steering clear of spot\\n∙Reliance closes latest tender\\n∙Some Brazil Q1 settlements at $110-115/mt CFR\\n∙Med prices also down\\n∙Some European Q1 settlements down $5/mt from Q4\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply\\nMosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced phosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.\\nCorrection: Last week\\'s edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nKazakhstan: Exports down 21% for 2015\\nKazakhstan’s December 2015 imports decreased 59% year on year to 163,781 mt, leaving full-year imports\\ndown 21% to 2.75 million mt.\\nChina was the main outlet for Kazakh tonnes in 2015, taking 1.34 million mt of exports, 13% less than in 2014.\\nChina remained a key outlet in December, taking 77,384 mt of the December exports.\\nIn December, Kazakhstan also sent 30,794 mt to Brazil, 18,000 mt to Benin, 16,000 mt to Lebanon, 11,991 mt to Lithuania, and 9,612 to Ukraine.\\nKazakhstan had been increasing export volumes in\\nrecent years as the sulphur stockpile at Tengiz was drawn down. TengizChevroil’s stockpile was fully\\ndepleted in H1 2015, with export volumes decreasing in H2 2015.\\nRussia: November exports down 42% on year\\nRussia’s November 2015 exports of sulphur plunged 42% year on year, with imports for the first 11 months\\nof the year down 29% at 2.62 million mt.\\nThe largest taker of November volumes was\\nMorocco, with 46,271 mt. Other key outlets were\\nChina (25,746 mt), Israel (20,186 mt), and\\nArgentina (14,038 mt).\\nRussia’s volumes to most of its key destinations\\ndeclined in 2015 to November, although exports to Lithuania more than tripled to 198,189 mt and exports to Israel increased 40% to 115,068 mt.\\nExports to the US reached 59,689 mt compared with only 10,998 mt over the same period in 2014 as the country increased its intake of solid sulphur.\\nRussia: Q1 contracts settled but no Morocco\\nSuppliers of Russian sulphur said they had settled Q1 contracts with North African buyers aside from OCP.\\nSettlements were reportedly in the high $110s/mt CFR.\\nRussian suppliers will skip Q1 contracts with Morocco.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Further Q1 contracts settled at minus $5/mt\\nEuropean Q1 contracts for sulphur appeared to be near full settlement, with further settlements confirmed at $5/mt decreases from Q4.\\nSome buyers are pushing for greater decreases in the wake of the recent decline in the US contract price as well as falling prices elsewhere around the world.\\nEuropean sellers had originally offered a rollover in December, but had since decreased this to minus $5/mt.\\nAs downstream markets struggle, European sulphur buyers argue that they need to have similar raw material price decreases to their international counterparts in order to remain competitive. The US settlement at a decrease of $15/lt therefore provided extra impetus for a decrease.\\nBut sellers have argued that the European liquid market itself is relatively balanced, with little basis for large price decreases.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSouth Africa: Imports drop by a third in 2015\\nSouth Africa’s 2015 imports of sulphur were 33% lower than 2014 at 421,992 mt.\\nTonnes mainly came from Saudi Arabia (35%), Kuwait (25%), Qatar (19%), and Canada (17%).\\nDecember imports were a mere 243 mt.\\nFoskor\\'s phosphate plant has suffered a series of technical issues and labour disputes, and continues to have issues with power shortages, all contributing towards a lower operating rate and reduced sulphur imports.\\nIt is worth noting, however, that some of the imports would likely have been for re-export to neighbouring Zambia, where South Africa sent 171,234 mt in 2015, 25% less than in 2014.\\nNorth Africa: Q1 sulphur contracts mostly concluded\\nNorth African Q1 contracts for sulphur supply are mostly settled, though some negotiations continued.\\nContract settlements have been reported in a wide range from the low $90s/mt CFR to the upper $110s/mt CFR.\\nMeanwhile, Morocco’s OCP is not expected to settle Q1 contracts with Russian suppliers, as the two sides were unable to reach a consensus.\\nOn the spot market, one source suggested that producer was being offered below $90/mt CFR, but this was not confirmed by sellers or traders.\\nMiddle East: Spot assessed lower but business limited\\nMiddle East spot prices were assessed lower based on sellers’ official postings as well as falling bids and\\nprices around the world.\\nHowever, spot availability from Middle East sellers is reportedly lacking until the end of February, with sellers focusing on contractual business.\\nThe lower end of the range is in line with Tasweeq’s February QSP of $89/mt FOB, while the upper end is in line with Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB. However, the upper end of this range is unlikely to be\\nachievable on sales to any region in the current market, although most deem the lower end lower than is necessary to achieve sales.\\nUAE: Adnoc posts $105/mt FOB OSP for February\\nAdnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $105/mt FOB Ruwais for February, down $17/mt from its January level, according to market sources.\\nThis represents a delivered price to India in the low-to-mid $110s/mt CFR.\\nIt follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan,\\ndown $30/mt from its December level. Aramco posted its February price mid-January at $115/mt FOB Jubail, down $13/mt from its January price.\\nQatar: Tasweeq cuts QSP to $89/mt FOB for February\\nTasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for February at $89/mt FOB Ras Laffan, down $30/mt from its January number.\\nThis marks the biggest drop in the QSP since April 2014. It is well below Aramco Trading\\'s official February price of $115/mt FOB, which the producer posted in mid-January.\\nPrices have been under considerable pressure as a result of weak downstream fertilizer markets as well as increased global supply.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Assessment down but business lacking\\nIndian spot prices were assessed down at $110-120/mt CFR following global price falls, but firm indications and business were lacking.\\nSome in the Indian market pegged prices as low as $100-105/mt CFR, but other players were sceptical. Adnoc’s OSP for February equates to the low-to-mid-$110s/mt CFR.\\nDemand has been limited as Indian buyers have shown a preference for sulphuric acid and are currently comfortable with stock levels.\\nMeanwhile, most sources were under the impression that Reliance’s 25,000 mt sulphur sales tender, which\\nclosed January 28, was in fact scrapped, though this was not confirmed.\\nIndia: Imports up in November but down for 11 months\\nIndia’s November 2015 imports of sulphur increased 4% year on year to 90,490 mt, though imports for the first 11 months were still down 19% at 1.25 million mt.\\nQatar supplied the majority of the November tonnes as the source of 45,374 mt.\\nOther sources of tonnes in November included\\nKuwait (27,483 mt) and Bahrain (12,607 mt).\\nQatar and Saudi Arabia were the main sources of Indian sulphur imports over the first 11 months of the year, with market shares of 34% and 28% respectively.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Price falls across the board but spot dead\\nPrice decreases were again reported across the board for Chinese sulphur.\\nFor international business, sources suggested conclusions around $100/mt CFR for granular product, but nothing was confirmed at this level. Some buyers were reportedly bidding around $90-95/mt CFR, and there were unconfirmed reports of offers at $100/mt CFR. Some argued that the lack of spot business meant that the real price level was $110-115/mt CFR, the upper end of which was in line with Adnoc\\'s OSP of $105/mt\\nFOB, though well below Aramco’s February price of $115/mt FOB.\\nSources mostly reported crushed and molten sulphur in the $90s/mt CFR. There was a third-party report of a granular deal at $85/mt CFR as well as a molten deal at $88/mt CFR for March shipment.\\nSome importers questioned whether they would be able to obtain product at Tasweeq’s QSP of $89/mt FOB, with many believing that the low level was offered as an opportunity for the producer’s offtakers to make up\\nfor negative margins in previous months.\\nThere was limited activity at all major ports, as many traders had already started taking holidays. At Nantong and Zhenjiang, granular product was offered around RMB 850-860/mt FCA, with prices at similar levels even at Qingdao, where quotes tend to be higher.\\nPort inventories climbed to around 1.44 million mt with traders on holiday while many consumers stopped moving product to plants from late January. Inventories may rise as high as 1.6-1.7 million mt by the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.\\nDomestic prices also fell further. Sinopec’s Puguang reduced its prices twice within three days, with its price at Wenzhou port down to RMB 880/mt FCA from RMB 930/mt last week and plant prices down to RMB 870/mt EXW from RMB 900/mt. The producer needs to clear as much stock as possible because of the Chinese holidays. Its inventories were around 25,000 mt at port and 60-70,000 mt at plant including granular and molten volumes.\\nOther refineries also lowered prices by up to RMB 70/mt.\\nPhosphate companies argue that sulphur prices should fall further because of downstream weakness. As these buyers will be producing at relatively high rates following the holidays for the domestic Spring season, they will need some sulphur. Price movement will therefore be highly influenced by how many tonnes sellers attempt to push into the market.\\nJapan: December exports down a third\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year\\nexports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nThe Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.\\nExports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.\\nVolumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.\\nMost of the remaining volumes went to\\nSoutheast Asia, Taiwan and Australia.\\nThe Philippines was the key destination for Japanese exports in the month of December, taking 109,994 mt.\\nOther export destinations included India (18,098\\nmt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

This is being helped by the lack of spot sales, for now at least, from Mexico to the likes of Brazil and Morocco.\\nMexico’s exports for the first 11 months 2015 were 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014\\nas the Boleo mine was running producing acid with minimal internal use. For 2016 it is believed that most if not all of Boleo’s volumes have been committed to Chile.\\nAlthough Morocco’s OCP remains out of the spot market, this is at least partially because of the large volume\\nof pre-booked tonnes the buyer has arriving in Q1, which may have also left European producers more comfortable in the immediate term.\\nSpot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were therefore assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.\\nMarket participants were more negative about Asian regions, with many pegging prices lower than the current assessment of $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and/or expecting price falls in the near future, as spot availability in the region is expected to increase.\\nSpot prices to India were assessed unchanged, but the country offered no spot demand as buyers were comfortable. The country has been a key outlet for Asian exports, and its November imports increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for the first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.\\nPressure will increase on prices in Asia if the PASAR smelter in the Philippines successfully ramps up following technical issues in the wake of its restart. Exports from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down\\n4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Further sources peg Brazil in $40s/mt CFR\\n∙Mexico exports to November up 75%\\n∙OCP out of spot as large volume pre-booked\\n∙Asian and European FOB steady for now\\n∙Indian demand weak\\n∙India imports to November up 66%\\n∙Japan 2015 exports down 4%\\nBase Metals\\nBase metal prices finally showed signs of stabilisation and recovery, with increases across the board driven by a weaker dollar as expectations of a further base rate hike by the Federal Reserve diminished. Indeed, copper and aluminium reached one-month highs while lead and zinc achieved their highest levels in four months. LME copper was up to $4,578/mt.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nSome questions remain regarding Mosaic\\'s liquid sulphur needs and sulphuric acid production during Q1. The producer\\'s Q1 sulphur agreement is assumed to have included an adjustment to its contracted volumes to account for its reduced need to make acid. However, since Mosaic has committed only to cutting \"up to\" 400,000 mt of finished phosphates the possibility remains of the producer either carrying over acid into Q2 or potentially selling spot acid in Q1.\\nThere were price plunges in a range of markets this week, as much of China had already gone on holiday and Middle East producers posted lower prices for February. The most dramatic decline was Tasweeq\\'s $30/mt reduction of its QSP to $89/mt FOB, while Adnoc posted a more modest of $17/mt, bringing its OSP to $105/mt FOB. Exceptional weakness in downstream fertilizer markets has added to the downwards pressure that was already resulting from increases in supply.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam values fell to $1,050-1,100/mt CFR China this week, the lowest the index has been according to CRU records dating back to July 2004.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Spot market quiet on limited demand\\nThe US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving.\\nSome argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand.\\nMeanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.\\nMexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt\\nMexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.\\nThe US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.\\nMexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.\\nFor January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.\\nThe increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.\\nCRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.\\nIn recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.\\nConversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: FOB steady as sellers comfortable\\nSpot prices for European exports of sulphuric acid were assessed stable at $0-10/mt FOB Northwest Europe given a lack of new business and indications.\\nAlthough some sources have suggested lower prices, particularly based on volumes previously agreed for sale to North Africa, most believe that negative FOB spot business is unlikely for now.\\nSources suggest that contractual offtake remains relatively firm, while the large volumes scheduled for Q1 arrival to Morocco also leave sellers more comfortable.\\nWith recent Brazilian business reportedly in the $40s/mt CFR, the current European FOB range seems reflective.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP out of spot as large volumes pre-booked\\nOCP is understood to still be out of the sulphuric acid spot market, and is likely to remain so for the remainder of February.\\nMorocco has a large volume scheduled to arrive in Q1, and given the weakness in downstream fertilizer markets and falling sulphur prices, there will be little incentive for OCP to seek additional tonnes on a spot basis. The buyer reportedly has several vessels waiting at ports.\\nSources are now waiting to see what OCP’s likely requirement will be for Q2.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand lacking as buyers comfortable\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid imports into India were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt CFR, though spot business is scarce.\\nOne source said they have heard business in the $30s/mt CFR, but such levels would likely be difficult to achieve at this stage.\\nBuyers were pushing for numbers as low as the upper $10s/mt CFR, but were comfortable on stock levels with no strong demand.\\nMeanwhile, traders said that CIL has actively started discussing contract prices for 2016 for balance quantities, but there was no confirmation.\\nIndia: November imports jump 72%\\nIndia’s November 2015 imports of sulphuric acid increased 72% year on year to 95,293 mt, with imports for\\nthe first 11 months up 66% at 1.24 million mt.\\nThe vast majority of the November tonnes came from South Korea, while 18,643 mt came from Spain. This marked the first time India has imported sulphuric acid from Spain.\\nJapan and South Korea were the main sources of Indian acid imports over the year to November, supplying 503,750 mt and 479,667 mt respectively.\\nImports from China increased to 119,652 mt from nothing in previous years, while those from the Philippines climbed 15% to 66,791 mt. Imports from North Korea also increased from nothing to 45,590 mt.\\nBrazil: Prices in $40s/mt CFR limit negativity\\nSources suggested that the recent tenders from Yara and Mosaic were awarded in the $40s/mt CFR, though details were not confirmed.\\nPrices were pegged as high as the mid-to-high $40s/mt CFR, but the upper $40s/mt CFR would suggest increasing prices, which seems unlikely given price movements in broader markets.\\nThe Yara requirement is reportedly being met by tonnes from Peru.\\nYara’s tender for 18,000 mt for delivery early March closed January 15, while Mosaic was heard to be\\nseeking 12,000 mt a week later.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Domestic prices stabilise as stocks cleared\\nAcid prices in China were relatively stable over the course of the week, as destocking was mostly completed.\\nRecent production cuts by sulphur burners and pyrite plants have also been supportive.\\nMany smelters prices are now less than RMB 100/mt EXW and may be negative after March. This is down from RMB 150-300/mt in H1 2015, and it is likely that smelters may be at negative prices within Q1.\\nImport prices were pegged from the high $10s/mt to the low $20s/mt CFR.\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot unchanged; falls expected\\nSpot prices for East Asian exports of sulphuric acid remained assessed at $0-10/mt FOB Japan/South Korea given a lack of new business and indications.\\nSources have suggested levels at either end of this price range, though more believed that lower prices were likely, most prevalently minus $5/mt to $5/mt FOB. Indeed, some sources believe that Asian prices will decline further over coming weeks as availability eases. For now though, firm spot indications were scarce.\\nJapan: Exports inch down 4% for 2015\\nJapan’s December 2015 exports of sulphuric acid plunged 32% year on year to 115,119 mt, leaving full-year exports down 4% at 2.71 million mt.\\nThe Philippines was the largest outlet for 2015 exports, taking 1.26 million mt, though this was 5% less than in 2014.\\nExports to India, on the other hand, climbed to 503,372 mt from 379,532 mt.\\nVolumes to Chile declined to 319,910 mt from 421,635 mt, while exports to China plunged to 26,541 mt from 114,985 mt.\\nMost of the remaining volumes went to Southeast\\nAsia, Taiwan and Australia.\\nThe Philippines was as usual the outlet for largest share of Japanese exports in December, taking 109,994 mt.\\nOther export destinations included India (18,098 mt), Australia (10,499 mt), and Taiwan (6,500 mt), with around 5,000 mt to each of Singapore and Vietnam.\\nPhilippines: No acid exports in October\\nExports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines for the first 10 months of the year fell 40% year on year to 131,357 mt, and the country did not export any acid in October.\\nIndonesia was the main destination, receiving 64,900 mt from January through October.\\nThe remainder has gone to Malaysia, Australia and\\nIndia also received product.\\nThe country resumed exports in August and\\nSeptember, having not exported any acid over the\\nMay-July period.\\nIn recent years, exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as the PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan.\\nThe smelter shut April 16, 2015 for maintenance and work to increase capacity. The sulphuric acid capacity was 500,000 mt/year and work at the site\\nwas intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until at least mid-2016.\\nAlthough the plant has sold some tonnes since its restart, it has also reportedly had some delays ramping up, and the current and future production of the smelter remains one of the key uncertainties in global acid markets.\\nThe Philippines’ October 2015 imports increased to 95,878 mt, up from only 2,114 mt in October 2014. However, total imports for the first 10 months were still down 13% at 375,205 mt.\\nAlmost all of the imports have come from Japan, although Taiwan was the source of 8,444 mt, the majority of which (6,037 mt) was imported in June 2015.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

In March combined exports from Brazil of soya, corn and raw sugar reached 9.0 Mt, up from 3.5 Mt in February. Evidently, this has so far had limited positive effect on the freight market.\\nThe first quarter of 2015 marked the lowest quarter for average vessel earnings in the Panamax sector ($4,815/day) since the Baltic Exchange began assessing the four main Panamax time charter routes in 1993.\\nRates for smaller and geared dry bulk carriers, such as Supramaxes and Handysizes, have seen some modest increases, but are nonetheless depressed by recent standards. The Q1 earnings for Handysize vessels, for example, averaged $6,434/day, down 46% on the same quarter last year.\\nAgainst such a low spot market, forward contracts in the freight futures (FFA) market have declined yet again. The FFA contract for the Panamax four timecharter routes for April-December 2015 were priced at $6,000/day at the beginning of April, down from $7,000/day for the same contract a month before.\\nSSY Consultancy & Research Ltd\\nWhile care has been taken to ensure that the information contained in this report is accurate, it is supplied without guarantee.

Maire Tecnimont has already completed front-end engineering\\ndesign for the Nevinnomyssk facility and the Kingisepp ammonia plant.\\nThe companies will also work on two ammonia-urea projects, in Louisiana and Zhanatas, Kazakhstan.\\nThe projects will provide EuroChem with an additional five million tonnes of ammonia and 7.5 million tonnes of urea capacity per year.\\nKingisepp will have capacity to produce 2,700 mt/day of ammonia. The Nevinnomyssk plant will add a further 2,700 mt/day of ammonia as well as granular urea capacity of 3,500 mt/day.\\nIn recent years, Eurochem has had a shortfall in ammonia capacity, forcing it to purchase the feedstock from other suppliers. Kingisepp and Nevinnomyssk particularly, while costing an aggregate $2.5 billion before a slated start-up date of 2018, will pare EuroChem\\'s ammonia deficit.\\nTheir development appears to be a way of backward integrating to allow EuroChem to top up its own supply chain, leading it to breakeven on ammonia production, or even become a seller of the product.\\nThe company already has a phosphate fertilizer processing facility at Kingisepp while the sites have easy access to export terminals in Estonia and the Black Sea.\\nHowever, with the company also constructing potash operations at Gremyachaya and Berezniki in Russia, there are questions over whether its ambitious capacity additions may place a significant capex burden on its shareholders.\\nTRADE\\nFertilizer index: Falls across all but one benchmanrk\\nMost fertilizer price benchmarks again declined from a week earlier in this week\\'s Fertilizer Index.\\nUrea (granular) FOB Middle East underwent the largest proportional drop, declining 2.7% or $6.50/mt to $245.25/mt.\\nThe biggest absolute drops were in Urea (granular) FOB barge NOLA and MAP CFR Brazil.

However, while acknowledging the risk, our base case forecast is that the economy manages a broadly orderly transition to a slower trend rate of growth. Growth that is much less driven by investment and industry as consumption and the service sectors take a more prominent role.\\nIn the first of a series of China focus White Papers we set out our economic base case for China, review potential triggers for a significantly worse outcome, explain what we believe the government\\'s response to such an outturn would look like and present a downside alternative to our base case.\\nBackground and CRU’s base case economic forecasts for China\\nThere are several potential triggers that could initiate a sharp economic downturn, but before turning to them\\nit is worth briefly reviewing the background to where the economy is now and CRU‟s base case economic\\nforecasts for China. In terms of background:\\n∙Maturing economy and adverse demographics: As economies develop it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain extremely rapid growth rates . For China, this is exacerbated by demographic factors which the United Nations forecast will cause the growth in the number of people of working age to slow from an average of 0.4%pa during the five years to 2014 to -0.2%pa in the five years to 2019.\\n∙Ambitious economic reforms: Linked to China‟s increasing level of economic development, the government is embarking on an ambitious and vital program of economic reforms. In order to sustain a relatively rapid economic catch up with more developed economies and to improve the quality of life of its people, the government is committed to transforming the growth model away from a narrow focus on economic growth driven by investment and industry and to giving markets a greater role in place of the State.\\n∙Surge in credit: Post-2008 China experienced an increase in leverage that is enormous by international historical experience. The government responded to the global financial crisis that hit in 2008 by announcing a massive stimulus program of RMB4 trillion, equivalent to 13% of GDP. The stimulus was delivered via a surge in bank and non-bank lending that has ultimately seen credit as a share of GDP balloon from 115% at the end of 2008 to 187% at the end of 2014 as local governments and corporates binged on credit to fund investment. The jump in non-bank lending is of particular concern.\\nReflecting the economic challenges faced by China, CRU‟s base case forecasts are for GDP growth to decelerate further this year to 6.9% and for growth to average 6.6% in the period to 2019. Having directly accounted for half of the expansion in GDP over the past decade investment now accounts for 46% of the economy – an unusually high share by international historical standards – and bears the brunt of the deceleration, dragging industrial production down with it.\\nHowever, we have long flagged that the balance of risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside and it is therefore worth considering potential triggers for a significantly worse outcome.\\nRisks exist due to the marked increase in the economy’s leverage and the reform program.\\n(1) Real estate meltdown\\nThe credit surge helped fuel the real estate boom which is now unwinding, with the value of real estate sales dropping by 6% last year and by 16% y/y in the first two months of 2015. A complete record of borrowing for real estate and mortgages is not available but figures for bank loans outstanding, only, show an increase of 237% from the end of 2008 to the end of 2014 compared to a 147% rise in bank lending to the rest of the economy. Together, loans to the real estate sector and for mortgages account for 34% of outstanding bank credit. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the real estate sector has also been heavily reliant on non-bank credit, particularly since 2012 when controls on bank lending to real estate were tightened. Defaults on real estate related loans could cause a credit crunch that would hit the economy hard. Moreover, local governments rely on land sales for one-quarter of their revenues and a sharp downturn in these revenues could force local governments to cut back spending, particularly on infrastructure investment.\\n(2) Shadow banking crisis\\n„Shadow banking‟ credit outstanding has grown substantially since 2008 from 17% to 54% of GDP and at the end of 2014 amounted to RMB34 trillion. A key reason for the rapid growth is that shadow banking was subject to less regulation and government control than formal bank lending. The extremely rapid growth, relative loose lending standards and opaqueness of the lending raise concerns over the potential scale of bad loans in shadow banking. Households are directly exposed to shadow banking via their purchases of Wealth Management Products offering higher interest rates than those available via bank deposit accounts. Households may not be aware that their money is at risk. As was seen in early 2014, concerns over the potential for trust funds to default caused a loss of confidence and the risk is that this is repeated on a larger scale.\\n(3) Reform of local government borrowing\\nSince 2008 borrowing by local government has increased rapidly and by the end of last year totalled around RMB22 trillion (US$3.7 trillion), or just over one-third of GDP. Due to central government restrictions on direct borrowing by local governments, the bulk of borrowing has been via so-called Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs) and outside of budgetary control. In September last year the central government announced a reform of local government borrowing to increase budgetary transparency and discipline. In brief:\\n∙The reforms allow provincial governments to issue bonds to fund public investment, but lower tiers of government will not be allowed to issue bonds. The central government will set a quota on provincial bond issues and for 2015 the quota is RMB1 trillion;\\n∙Projects that have commercial returns, such a metro systems, are to be undertaken by public- private-partnerships (PPPs). There are no official restrictions on the debt issuance of PPPs, but the debt will not be guaranteed by government;\\n∙Existing debt will also be restructured as part of the reforms, lowering debt servicing costs.\\nThe reforms are a welcome step towards putting local government finances and borrowing onto a sustainable footing. However, the changes bring uncertainty and probable delays to local government investment – for example, the provincial bond issuance quota for this year was only announced in the first half of March. It is also unclear how successful PPPs will be. Clearly there is a risk that local government infrastructure investment falls as a result. With budgets under pressure, local State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) could also curtail investment, employment or some combination of the two if local government funding is withdrawn.\\n(4) Loss of confidence and capital outflows\\nChina‟s risk profile, its slowing economic growth and its narrowing interest rate premium over the US all make it less attractive to investors. A loss of confidence could trigger large capital outflows, while the ongoing anti-corruption campaign is a second possible driver of capital outflows. An exit of money could hit lending, investment and lead to a further deterioration of confidence levels.\\nHow would the government respond?\\nPresident Xi Jinping‟s warnings of the lessons to be learnt from the demise of the Soviet Union‟s communist party make it clear that maintaining the pre-eminence of the Chinese Communist Party is of paramount importance to the leadership. By extension, economic stability – and, more importantly, labour market and social stability – is critical and the government would respond rapidly if one of the above events were to trigger a sudden deceleration in economic growth. CRU believes that the Chinese authorities are well placed to act. That said, we believe that the authorities would respond much more cautiously than was the case in 2008 given the problems that stimulus stored up for the future.\\nBail outs: The government would bail out the financial system. In China‟s 1998 banking crisis, banks non- performing loans amounted to 50% of loans outstanding (the funds had predominantly gone to SOEs). The bail-out totalled 47% of GDP. If we assume that 50% of the increase in credit since 2008 is non-performing, a bail out would amount to 36% of GDP and would raise central government debt from 20% of GDP to a comfortably manageable 56%. Looked at another way, the central government could assume responsibility for:\\n∙All of the debts of local governments, which total 35% of GDP.\\n∙All trust fund loans. Trusts are a source of concern and defaults would have a large negative impact on confidence as they are typically viewed as being guaranteed by the State. However, at 8% of GDP the government could choose to stand behind trust loans and for 15% of GDP it could take on all of the assets of trust funds – albeit at the expense of reinforcing moral hazard.\\nChina is also in a position to avoid the type of credit crunch that was seen in the developed economies in the 2008 crisis as the government has much more direct control over bank lending.\\nInterest rates and liquidity: Interest rates can be lowered from current levels which for one year bank loans are in excess of 4% in real terms. Lower interest rates would reduce the cost of servicing existing debt, even if the government prevented an upturn in new credit outstanding. During the years of massive foreign exchange inflows the People‟s Bank of China raised banks Required Reserve Ratios (RRR) - the proportion of deposits that banks must keep in reserve – from 6% in 2003 to a peak of 21% in 2011 to limit the increase in liquidity the inflows would bring. This ratio could be lowered to offset the drain on liquidity of capital outflows.\\nGovernment investment: The scope for lowering taxes to boost the economy is limited as tax revenues account for just 19% of GDP. More likely would an increase in government spending, with infrastructure investment to the fore as was the case in 2008 and in response to China‟s banking crisis in\\n1998. Investment in other priority areas would also be increased, such as social housing, public services and the environment.\\nReal estate and reforms: Real estate would be at the centre of the crisis but as a cornerstone of the economy is „too big to fail‟. Policies towards real estate would be relaxed, such as lowering mortgage rates, reducing mortgage down payments and easing restrictions on those eligible to buy. Further reform of the urban household registration system (hukou reform) would also be likely. One-third of the urban population, over 250 million people, are migrants that are effectively locked out of the formal housing market and do not\\nhave access to public services such as education and health. Hukou reform would increase the pool of potential property buyers and lift their discretionary spending power. Policies to open sectors of the economy to private participation and investment would also likely be accelerated. SOEs have soaked up credit since 2008, crowding out private enterprises, but SOEs are relatively inefficient and their return on assets has fallen since 2008 and is now less a third of that of the private sector.\\nNote, in our view the government would not weaken the RMB significantly. Firstly, a depreciating currency would exacerbate capital outflows and the loss of investor confidence. Secondly, in past crisis the RMB has been held flat against the US$. If the RMB were to come under significant market pressure the People‟s Bank has US$4 trillion of foreign currency reserves to draw on and support it.\\nHow long for government policy to have an impact?\\nThe government would respond quickly. Firstly, downside risks to the Chinese economy have been evident for some time and it is likely that the government has contingency plans ready to implement. Secondly, the government‟s response in 2008 was swift: the investment bank Lehman Brothers unexpectedly collapsed on 15th September, triggering the global financial crisis. The Chinese government‟s stimulus was announced on 9th November 2008. GDP growth slowed from 9.7% y/y in 2008Q3 to 6.6% in 2009Q1, but rebounded to 9.7% in 2009Q3 and peaked at 12.4% in 2010Q1 as investment expanded rapidly. The accuracy of the GDP figures is debatable but other indicators which are viewed as more reliable, such as cement production and industrial power consumption show, a similarly speedy turnaround (albeit after larger negative impacts).\\nThat said, CRU sees important differences between now and 2008 that we believe would imply a more muted recovery. The 2008 downturn was caused by events overseas whereas the risks this time are domestically focused and could have a larger negative impact on household and business confidence. Last time the government was able to unleash investment spending which climbed by 22% y/y in 2009 after growth of 9% in 2008, offsetting the collapse in exports. This time investment itself would be the cause of\\nthe crisis and weakness would be harder to offset. Lastly, China allowed a rapid increase in credit last time but will not want to repeat that approach this time.\\nWhat would be the economic impact?\\nWhichever potential trigger initiates the downturn investment would be at the core of it, with real estate and local government funded investment most at risk. As demand from those sectors falters and confidence dives, investment by other industries would also be hit. Similarly, consumer demand for autos and appliances would also be particularly vulnerable as spending on such „big ticket‟ items is relatively easy to postpone and, in any case, is correlated with housing sales.\\nIndustrial production would slow sharply due to weaker demand while destocking would further lower output. However, exports and the demand for non-durable consumer goods, such as food, would hold up relatively well and cushion the downturn. Construction activity, machinery output and consumer durables output would perform worse than the economy overall and real consumption of metals with them. Metals destocking would lower apparent consumption further.\\nFor the purposes of this scenario we assume that the crisis starts in 2015Q2. The largest hit to GDP, investment and industrial production growth rates occur in 2015. The government‟s policy response becomes evident in 2016 and recovering investment lifts industrial output growth which also benefits from re- stocking. Medium term growth rates return towards the base case but, in line with international experience that financially driven downturns result in a permanent loss of output , the level of activity does not regain the levels seen in the base case. In 2019 GDP is 3% smaller than in the base case (a loss of US$385bn), investment over 4% smaller and industrial production over 3% smaller. We would also expect to see the composition of credit and investment to evolve in the medium term. The government‟s initial response to a downturn would be to boost State-funded investment, but also to accelerate reforms. Beneficiaries of reforms would be private sector businesses which would see improved access to credit. Households would also see improved access to credit, allowing them to lower the proportion of income they save and lift\\nconsumption. Household finances are lightly leveraged: mortgages outstanding account for just 17% of GDP and could be safely increased.\\nWhy is the impact not bigger?\\nCompared to the experience of many developed economies in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and of that of a range of emerging markets in earlier crises, China appears to escape lightly in our scenario. After all, in their study of economic crises in 190 countries the economists Cerra and Saxena studied found that banking crisis in countries with a similar income level to China resulted in a loss of GDP relative to trend of around 12% on average (and a range of 8% to 18%) – their results for Asian countries show similar results.\\nA key difference of China to many other countries is that the Chinese government retains a very powerful role in the economy which will enable it to act quickly and directly support spending and the flow of credit. Most importantly, however, rather than exploding in a short space of time China‟s financial crisis is playing out in slow motion and to a large extent is already captured in our base case forecasts. Indeed, restructuring of local government debt is already happening, while regulation of shadow banking has increased over the past year and reform of inefficient, capital absorbing SOEs is beginning.\\nConclusion\\nChina plays a pivotal role in global commodity markets and it is understandable that worries over the country‟s economic prospects can quickly escalate and become the focal point for markets. China faces major economic challenges that will remain with us over a five year horizon and longer. A significant downturn in growth centred on the metal intensive segments of the economy, as we have outlined in this White Paper, is a very real downside risk.\\nIf there were a sudden deceleration in economic growth, CRU believes the Chinese government would respond quickly and decisively. The government will have contingency plans ready to implement and these plans would reverse steep declines in GDP and IP within 12-18 months. As a consequence, although there\\nwould be a permanent loss of output to the Chinese economy, it would be at far lower levels than experienced by many economies after the 2008 crisis.\\nIt is easy to forget that China is still a developing country with massive scope for economic growth. By 2025 we expect the Chinese economy to be 90% larger in real terms than it was in 2014 – a gain equivalent\\nto today‟s US$ size of the economies of Germany, Italy, Turkey, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and\\nThailand combined. We are right to be worried about China in the short-term, but the economy still has massive growth potential into the longer-term.\\nAbout CRU\\nWith a team of 20 people in Beijing and a centralised Economics team supporting all Analysis and Consulting activities CRU is uniquely placed to analyse the Chinese economy in the context of commodity outlooks.\\nCRU‟s Beijing capability allows us to\\n∙Gather vital intelligence on Chinese market activities for our prices assessment, cost modelling and market outlook services\\n∙Work with our clients on a bespoke basis, through CRU Consulting, helping them to understand the opportunities and threats China offers those exposed to commodity markets\\n∙Offer privileged access to our team of Chinese analysts, on the ground in Beijing and in our London office\\nCRU‟s Economics team offers an extensive portfolio of proprietary services including\\n∙Regular updates on economic news for developed and emerging, commodity, countries\\n∙Global economic and end-use sector outlook that feeds into all CRU Market Outlooks\\n∙Global macro-economic cost input analysis that feeds into all CRU Cost Services\\n∙Proprietary analysis and modelling of key issues such as long term demand trends by consumption sector\\nFor information on how CRU can help you understand the commodities markets through our suite of products and tailored solutions, please contact sales@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The deal purportedly done by SIUCI could however not be confirmed with the party alleged to have taken the tons.\\nNetbacks from Thailand have also improved, with two sales suggested around an even $280/mt CFR following prior deals around $275/mt CFR, and there is significant open interest in additional cargos.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: STC closes April 10 tender with awards for 510,000 mt\\nIndian importer STC has closed its April 10 tender for an unspecified quantity of urea pursuant to the issuance of awards for the 510,000 mt listed in the April 17 Market Alert. The additional 30,000 mt indicated available by Global did not get booked. A follow-up tender by IPL is expected in the first half of May. Coromandel Int\\'l is meanwhile in discussions with suppliers for a full supramax cargo of urea for Vizag for June arrival to be used as raw material for NPK production.\\nSTC\\'s awards are tabulated in the following:\\n\\nApt= As per tender\\nM=Mundra, K=Kandla, Kp= Krishnapatnam, Pi= Pipavav\\nIndian Financial Year (FY) April-March 2014-2015 imports of 8.75 million mt were up by 23.4% on the 2013- 2014 FY according to the latest provisional FAI trade data.\\nSales of urea totalled 28.4 million mt during the April 2014-March 2015 FY, up by 1.4% on the prior year. The March volume marginally below 2.5 million mt was up on the 2.02 million mt delivered in March 2014, and followed an increase in February 2015 to 2.7 million mt from the 2.05 million mt sold in February 2014.\\nDomestic production of urea was a shade short of 1.7 million mt in March 2015, bringing the total close to\\n22.6million mt for the full FY. This was down by 0.6% on the 2.72 million mt produced in the April 2013- March 2014 FY:\\nClosing stocks with individual Indian states were at a mere 130,000 mt at the end of March, but that quantity does not include imported quantities in ports and urea en-route to the states. A minor portion of quantities procured via the 1.15 million mt purchases in the December 3 IPL tender and most of the 1.03 million mt booked via the January 27 MMTC session had not reached individual Indian states at the time the data was collected.\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: May price tag fixed at $465/mt CFR\\nThe Tampa May price tag has been fixed at $465/mt CFR, down $20/mt on April, evidencing further weakness in the market.\\nThe decrease was expected due to ongoing downwards price pressure both West and East of Suez.\\nThe revelation last week that PotashCorp would be exporting more ammonia from Trinidad served to create even more pressure on Tampa pricing with Mosaic already arguing that falling phosphate values should stem any further increase, as seen for April Tampa prices.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: GTIS data show drop in Q1 MAP imports for 2105 but not as sharp a drop as ANDA data showed\\nOnly 12,000 mt difference between ANDA and GTIS MAP imports for Q1 2015; at 365,000 mt and 353,000 mt respectively.\\nGTSI data for March show 353,000 mt MAP imported in Q1 2015, down from 473,400 mt imported in the same period last year but almost 70,000 mt up on 2013.\\nThe data show considerably more from Russia this year, up at 145,000 mt, and correspondingly less from Morocco, at 55,000 mt. Interestingly the data show 75,000 mt arrive from Morcco in Q1 last year, not so much more than in 2015, mainly due to with loading delays out of Jorf Lasfar at the beginning of 2015.\\nThis year has seen Russian producers take the decision to compete on price to place tonnes against a backdrop of slow European demand while OCP has held back from selling into Brazil at the lower prices.\\nA modest quantity of MAP was reported from China during Q1 this year, just 42,000 mt, down from 89,000 mt last year.\\nANDA data, published last week in Fertilizer Week showed imports of over 600,000 mt MAP in Q1 last year whereas GTIS data for Q1 last year showed just 473,000 mt last year. This year the two sets of Q1 import data were more aligned with a difference of just 12,000 mt betwen the two. There are two possible reasons for the discrepancy last year, one is the difference in the timing of the data collection, i.e. ANDA data comprises cargoes that have been cleared for discharge whereas GTIS may take a later date. Therefore factors such as congestion at the ports, which occurred this time last year, can make a significant difference to the final numbers. The other reason could simply be a matter of grade/naming particularly with 10-50-0 and 11-44-0.\\nGTIS data for Q1 2015 show NP imports at 151,000 mt almost split equally between Chinese and US product. Q1 NP imports in 2013 and 2014 were higher at 210,000 mt and 246,000 mt respectively.\\nDAP imports, according to GTIS, reached 123,000 mt, a similar quantity to 2014 but down on the volume of 257,000 mt recorded for Q1 2013. This year almosty 100,000 mt DAP came from the US with a further 25,000 mt from Russia. We can expect more from origins other than the US and Morocco this year, following the removal of the 6% duty on imported DAP from certain origins such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Mexico.\\nImports of TSP and SSP were also down this year, as reported by GTIS. TSP imports were recorded at 46,000 mt in Q1, most originating from Israel. Just 4,400 mt came in from North Africa, substantially lower than in previous years. Morocco alone shipped 93,000 mt TSP in Q1 2013 and 48,000 mt in 2014.\\nBrazil: High level of Q1 phosphate rock imports\\nQ1 phosphate rock imports into Brazil reach close to record levels.\\nLatest GTIS data for March show Brazilian rock imports for Q1 at 471,000 mt, close to the record volume imported in Q1 2013 of 500,000 mt. Imports in Q1 last year were down at just 325,000 mt.\\nAlthough the volume of Bayovar rock for Vale was recorded at a lower level of 259,000 mt over the first three months of 2015, imports from Morocco reached 180,000 mt, a volume not seen since pre-Bayovar days.\\nAs the ANDA data published last week in Fertilizer Week showed, Brazilian P2O5 production of P2O5 products was up by 9% on last year but not as high as 2013, reflected in the trend of Q1 rock imports over the same period.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Phosagro sold out and indicating $470/mt FOB for June\\nAfter a period of aggressive selling and pricing in a number of markets in Asia and the Americas, Phosagro has lifted its price indications being fully committed through April and May.\\nPhosagro claims to be sold out until June on the back of recent sales to India, Brazil and its domestic and nearby markets. It has sold up to seven cargoes of mainly DAP plus some NPKs to Indian buyers, most for IPL and IFFCO for March/April/early May shipment. Total known tonnage committed to date for India is in the region of 92,000 mt NPKS and 222,000 mt DAP. The price for the initial DAP cargoes for India was heard in the mid $480s/mt CFR which given a freight estimate of around $31/mt, would give a netback for direct DAP sales in the low-mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic.\\nAdditional sales of MAP have also been made for Brazil for April/May shipment and Phosagro is now quoting $470/mt FOB Baltic for June shipment for MAP/DAP. It is also quoting $330-340/mt FOB Baltic for 15-15-15 following sales of this and other grades to India, the domestic and nearby markets plus some tonnes believed to have loaded for Venezuela.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: FAI show low imports and production for 2014/15 but sales and stock data do not reveal true picture.\\nImports and production in 2014/15 were both below the average for the previous five years, 2 million mt below in the case of imports. March sales figures show movement into the retail system rather than end user demand.\\nThe latest FAI data show total DAP production in India for the 2014/15 fertilizer year at 3.44 million mt, a six year low and well below the average of 3.8 million mt produced in the previous five years. The highest level of DAP production in the past five years was in 2009/10 when 4.25 million mt DAP were produced. This year production of DAP was particularly low in the run up to the Rabi season, with the industry regularly producing below 300,000 mt per month, mainly due to the the high cost of inputs.\\nNPK production in 2014/15 meanwhile reached a three year high of 7.83 million mt, above the five year average of 7.55 million mt. In 2010/11 and again in 2011/12, India produced over 8 million mt NPKs .\\nImports of DAP for the full fertilizer year 2014/15 reached 3.82 million t after almost 100,000 mt arrived in March.\\nAlthough more than the 3.3 million mt imported in 2013/14, the volume imported in 2014/15 was still 2 million mt DAP below the average import volume for the last five years of 5.8 million mt. The main reason for the\\nlower import volume was due to the late start to the import season caused primarily by concern over the monsoon. The even lower level of imports in 2013/14 had been due to the collapse in the rupee value against the USD.\\nThe excessively high stocks built up between 2011 and 2014 of over 3 million mt DAP (at their peak) appear to have been finally brought back down to normal levels. FAI data, although not showing the complete picture, show a clear trend of falling stock levels through the past few months with closing stocks at the end of March at just 152,550 mt.\\nThis was matched by the corresponding hike in reported sales for March of 755,360 mt. This should not be confused with actual sales to end users which are traditionally very low at this time of year. Rather it will be positioning by the industry into the retail system ahead of the budget and any potential drop in subsidy rates.\\nTherefore the low stock level of 152,550 reported by the FAI is underestimating the true picture as much of that sales volume of 755,000 mt reported in March, will have been stockpiled but stored within the retail system rather than sold to farmers. Even though stocks may therefore be as much as 800,000 mt or even a bit more, this can still be considered a healthy opening stock level for 2015/16 and well within optimum levels.\\nIndia: Up to 280,000 mt Russian and US DAP said to be heading for India\\nRussian and US cargoes, totalling up to 280,000 mt DAP, are heard heading for India but confirmation from both suppliers has been withheld.\\nFurther details have come to light regarding the sale of up to seven Russian DAP/NPK cargoes by Phosagro reported in the last Fertilizer Week Phosphates Report.\\nPhosagro has declined to comment on this business so price details are not clear yet but initial business was heard concluded in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Details of six of these cargoes are believed to be as follows:\\n*15-15-15 and 10-26-26\\nMosaic is said to be loading a panamax this month for its own distribution system in India however Mosaic prefers not to comment on any shipments to its Indian system. Current freights from Tampa to WC India are around $27/mt.\\nGSFC held an enquiry April 18 for a total of 125,000 mt dark DAP (18-46-0) of which 25,000 mt was for shipment to the East Coast and the balance to the West Coast, all for May shipment. GSFC did not receive any offers and the tender is likely to be scrapped. There is talk that it may issue a new tender once the NBS rates are finally announced.\\nMMTC will close its tender for 30,000 mt DAP on Thursday, April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada with offers to be valid for 15 days.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: DAP prices come under pressure\\nFiercer competition in the global rice market is a factor in the weakening DAP market in Vietnam with only branded DAP achieving decent prices.\\nDAP prices have been coming under further pressure not just due to seasonal reasons but as farmers in Vietnam struggle with falling rice prices. Exporters of rice are facing tougher competition on the global market and as such rice inventories are rising in Vietnam leaving farmers with reduced funds.\\nCurrent offers of DAP from China are below $490/mt CFR but meeting with no real buying interest with buyers now looking for lower numbers. Cross border tonnes are trading at lower prices in the range of $470- 475/mt CFR bagged, falling from $475-480/mt CFR 10 days ago. Branded DAP is still achieving a premium such as Australian and green DAP offered by from YUC, both trading over the past two weeks at or just above $500/mt CFR.\\nPOTASH\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Fertilizer year potash imports increase by third\\nIndia imported 4.2 million mt of potash in the fertilizer year 2014-15, a 32% increase on the previous fertilizer year, according to the latest FAI data.\\nDuring the Kharif season, potash imports were up 31% to 2.3 million mt while during the Rabi season, potash imports were up 33% to 1.9 million mt.\\nMarch potash imports were up 81% year on year to 202,000 mt, which along with more than 200,000 mt of potash in April, allows some buyers to build stocks and strengthen their negotiating power in the current contract talks.\\nClosing stock at the end of March was more than double that of the same point in 2014, at 289,410 mt.\\nwww.crugroup.comDaily Report | 9\\nSource: FAI PIS\\nIndian potash sales to non-complex manufacturers during the fertilizer year increased by 27% to 2.8 million mt meaning that potash sales to complex manufacturers are likely to have increased by roughly 41% to 1.4 million mt.\\nDuring the fertilizer year 14/15, Indian NPK production increased by 12.7% or almost 900,000 mt. Rising levels of NPK output mean increasing demand for potash, which is not produced in India, and this trend is expected to increase as DAP producers increase NPK production to offset high phosacid prices.\\nMost buyers in India now expect that potash imports could hit a record five million mt in the fertilizer year 2015-16 but await clarification of the NBS rates, indications of the monsoon outlook and potash contract pricing before any firm forecasts.\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: More Q2 liquid sulphur contracts close\\nPotashCorp reached agreements with its liquid sulphur suppliers late last week at $132/lt FOB Tampa covering Q2 deliveries to the company\\'s phosphate operations. This is down $15/lt from the company\\'s Q1 deal and in line with contract prices agreed by Mosaic and its suppliers last week.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Q2 contracts yet to settle\\nSuppliers of Russian product have yet to settle Q2 contracts, as producers and consumers have not been able to reach a consensus price.\\nAlthough buyers expect a substanial decrease, Russian producers are not willing to accept the scale of increase being sought, and so negotiations drag on.\\nMeanwhile, the resumption of river transport from April 1 has not gone as smoothly as sought. Low river levels have meant that only small volumes can be sent at higher-than-expected costs. Sellers already had a backlog of product to ship, and these issues have meant that this has not yet been resolved and only Q1 obligations have been shipped thus far, suggesting that all Q2 shipments will need to be completed within May and June.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Settlements for Q2 reported at decreases and rollovers\\nSome European sulphur contracts for Q2 have reportedly been settled at a rollover from the previous quarter, and one buyer confirmed achieving a slight decrease while others continue to push for decreases.\\nTraders suggested that some large buyers have confirmed rollovers, though Fertilizer Week has yet to verify this.\\nOne buyer at the TSI conference in Barcelona said that they had achieved a slight decrease of aroundd $5/mt, while another buyer said they would continue to seek a decrease of at least $10/mt.\\nBuyers are suffering negative effects from the strong dollar because they buy feedstock in dollars but sell product in euros, leaving them exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. The buyer also argued that availability for product was good.\\nBut sellers have argued that availability is tight as a result of refinery turnarounds and therefore prices should increase.\\nRefineries currently under or soon to begin maintenance included Mineraloelraffinerie Oberrhein (MIRO), Germany’s largest refinery in Karlsruhe; Shell\\'s refinery in Pernis, the Netherlands which is Europe’s largest; ExxonMobil’s refinery in Port Jerome, France; and the Isab refinery in Italy, 80%-owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG.\\nWork on Total’s Donges refinery in France was postponed to May from March, and is now scheduled to take place from May 4 to June 25. Total’s Lindsey UK refinery also recently underwent maintenance.\\nNeste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this month (April) started an eight-week turnaround, the largest in the refinery\\'s history.\\nMaintenance at Mediterranean facilities has also ramped up. In addition to the Isab maintenance, Greece\\'s Aspropyrgos facility went offline for scheduled maintenance from mid-April.\\nWhen negotiations for Q2 sulphur commenced, buyers were seeking decreases of $10-15/mt while sellers were expecting increases of $10-15/mt, leaving many away from negotiations expecting a rollover. Contracts for Q1 were settled unchanged from Q4 2014 at $158-170/mt CFR for barge/railcar liquid bulk and $170- 200/mt CPT for truckload liquid bulk.\\nAs reported last week, US Q2 contracts for liquid sulphur were settled at $132/lt CFR, down $15/lt from Q1.\\nNEWS\\nPRODUCTION\\nYara writes down value of Lifeco owing to regional instability\\nYara has written down the value of its Lifeco (Libyan Norwegian Fertiliser Company) fertilizer joint venture with the Libyan National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority by $112 million, leaving a remaining book value of $18 million.\\nYara said that owing to the worsening security outlook in Libya, it foresees further deterioration in operations at Lifeco nitrogen facilities located at Marsa El Brega this year.\\nThe company confirmed it would “continue participating in the governance of Lifeco, with the aim of resuming full production once real improvements are seen in the security and political situation in Libya”.\\nYara\\'s 50% shareholding in the joint venture was originally intended to provide the Norwegian fertilizer major with access to the exportable output from the two Marsa El Brega integrated ammonia and urea units. The joint venture provided Yara with the role as exclusive marketer for the ammonia and urea manufactured.\\nThe installations have been hampered by political unrest and erratic supply of natural gas and utilities ever since the 2009 agreement covering the venture was signed, rendering regular operations\\nimpossible. Widespread suggestions of corrupt practices in reaching the agreement with Libyan authorities have also negatively influenced Yara\\'s reputation.\\nPROJECTS\\nScoping study finishes at Highfield\\'s Sierra del Perdon potash project\\nA scoping study for Highfield Resources\\' Sierra del Perdon project in Spain has estimated that the project could deliver 520,000 mt/year of granular potash.\\nThe study expects that the project will require a capital investment of $233 million and projected operating expenditure to be $155/mt.\\nThe project is slated to have a mine life of 20 years and to deliver EBITDA of $120 million with a net present value of $527 million at an internal rate of return of 38.5%.\\nEarlier in April the company announced a maiden resource estimate for Sierra del Perdon, the company\\'s second project, showing an Indicated Mineral Resource of 41.8 million mt at 10.7% K2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 40.3 million mt at 10.5% K2O.\\nHighfield recently completed its DFS for its nearby flagship Muga project, proposing a steady state production of 1.1 million mt of granular K2O per year over an initial 24 year mine.\\n\"While our focus remains firmly on the rapid development of our flagship Muga project, Sierra del Perdon\\'s scoping study demonstrates the robustness of our broader project pipeline,\" Highfield Managing Director Anthony Hall said in a statement.\\nHighfield now plans to move forward with a pre-feasibility study for the Sierra del Perdon site, with new work to include additional drilling, underground engineering and detailed metallurgical test work.\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

June 2015 arrivals from China were down by 14% to 85,000 mt and shipments originating in Russia of 55,000 mt were down by 49%. UAE arrivals were 52,000 mt, up from zero in June 2014, and Ukraine also reappeared with 21,000 mt.\\nChina accounted for 338,000 mt in the first half of 2015, up by 42.4% on the prior year and arrivals from Russia were up by 16% to 337,000 mt. UAE arrivals were limited to the tonnage identified above while Ukrainian deliveries of 43,000 mt were down from 64,000 mt in H1 2014.\\nUS NOLA: Barges rebound after liquidation sales\\nLast week\\'s sharp drop in the US Gulf ultimately included discounted offers from multiple suppliers in the low $260s/st FOB New Orleans. However, what some saw as a panic driven only by a lack of contract barge\\nfreight exhausted itself by late September 4. Early this week granular urea barges had changed hands at prices nearly $10/st above last week\\'s lows.\\nThe new sales are returning $270-273/st FOB to sellers. However, the forward market is more cautious. Bids for physical positions for December were as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans, with business confirmed at $268/st FOB.\\nSome liquidation pricing often occurs ahead of the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River system in the US, but many traders with business served from the Arkansas River or by rail in to northern states see current values as a buying opportunity. By comparison, granular urea prices one year ago at New Orleans were over $353/st FOB.\\nUS Midwest: Prices move down, sales up\\nGranular urea is moving well on a prompt and a forward basis in the US Midwest, as distributors have moved prices down in recent days and weeks to reflect lower replacement costs.\\nAt midweek, granular urea was moving well from St. Louis at $300/st FOB and from the Twin Cities at\\n$305/st FOB. Distributors see little down-side risk, and the new-crop outlook still substantially favours corn over soybeans, potentially creating more nitrogen demand in the region than last year.\\nCanada: Imports down while exports increase\\nCanadian imports of urea in July were a mere 6,600 mt, according to customs data via GTIS. This was down from 131,000 mt in July 2014.\\nJanuary-July imports of 403,300 mt were down by 29.6% with the US taking the biggest hit with deliveries down by 53.2% to 128,500 mt.\\nArrivals from Germany and Russia of about 62,000 mt each were down by 4% and 11.9%, respectively. Arrivals from Bahrain were up from zero to 32,200 mt.\\nCanadian urea exports in July reached 105,100 mt, and increase of 17.2% on July 2014. This lifted January-July exports to 728,000 mt, an increase of 30% on the same period in 2014. Essentially all exports were destined for the US.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nCentral America: Trammo books Incofe\\nThe September 4 Incofe tender for 30,000 mt urea plus 10,000 mt AN for October loading was booked by Trammo for loading from the Baltic.\\nThe importer declined to reveal pricing in the deal, but local reports indicate that the urea traded at $283/mt CFR while the AN was suggested booked around $225/mt CFR.\\nFreight for the combination to discharge in Guatemala and Nicaragua is assessed around $28/mt, indicative of a return to Trammo below $255/mt FOB for the urea and around $195/mt FOB for the AN with no provisions for a margin.\\nBrazil: Granular urea values approach $280/mt CFR\\nRecent trades in granular urea of Middle East origin into Brazil are reported marginally above $280/mt CFR, down further on last week\\'s $282-285/mt CFR assessment.\\nSales at $281-282/mt CFR reflect Middle East netbacks at an even $260/mt FOB, significantly below most recent targets set by producers, but in line with returns available from other contract markets such as Thailand where delivered numbers are sliding below $280/mt CFR.\\nChile: Imports from China dominate\\nChilean urea imports in July of 73,000 mt were up by 52.6% on July 2014 according to data from customs via GTIS. China accounted for the full volume.\\nJanuary-July imports a shade short of 255,000 mt were up by 14.1% on the same months in 2014, with China accounting for a full 225,600 mt, up by 42.7%. Arrivals from Malaysia were up from zero to 27,500 mt while supplies from Venezuela dropped from 46,000 mt to zero.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Yuzhnyy prills available despite cuts\\nPrilled urea is still available for September loading from Yuzhnyy despite the turnarounds and closurtes at DnieproAzot and OPZ.\\nOffers from producers and marketers are maintained at or even above $270/mt FOB, but these fail to generate purchasing interest in a market where traders need to cover at $260/mt to generate a margin on sales to Turkey.\\nOffers to Turkish importers are suggested available at $275/mt CFR with credit, implying netbacks around $255/mt FOB.\\nLimited availability and limited demand is also reflected in the lineup for September, which so far stands at a mere 36,000 mt despite the large Trammo cargo for Brazil:\\nRussia: First half 2015 urea exports down 16.75%\\nRussian exports of urea in the first six months of 2015 were 2.35 million mt, down by 16.75% on the H1 2014 volume.\\nShipments to Brazil were nevertheless up by 8.9% to 546,000 mt, while deliveries to the US of 306,400 mt were down by 12.5%. Germany and Peru accounted for 187,000 mt and 137,000 mt, down by 18% and 24.2%, respectively. Deliveries to Ukraine were off by 4.3% to 116,000 mt while Turkey dropped by 51% to 106,000 mt.\\nJune shipments of 601,400 mt were 5.6% ahead of the prior year with the US in the lead with 148,200 mt, up from 38,500 mt in June 2014. Deliveries to Brazil of 132,000 mt were up by 47% and the 51,000 mt shipped to Peru in June 20156 were up from zero in June 2014.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Granular urea trades lower\\nMultiple trades in granular urea are reported this week around the €280/mt FCA marker, and distributors suggest that firm bids some €2-4/mt lower would likely trigger acceptances on the part of sellers.\\nA €278/mt FCA deal would equate to about $298/mt CFR with no provisions for storage costs, financing and margin. This would in turn provide sellers of Egyptian granular urea with netbacks around $270/mt FOB, also without margin.\\nTurkey: Prices drop while imports increase\\nFollowing numerous sales around the $285/mt CFR marker with credit as reported last week, Turkish importers are now suggesting that offers for larger cargoes are available down to $275/mt CFR, also with credit. The identity of the trader offering at the purported number was however not revealed.\\nImports of urea in July of 105,300 mt were meanwhile down by 25.6% on July 2014, but the January-July volume of 1.02 million mt was up by 14.4% on the prior year.\\nUkraine retained the lead for the first seven months with 436,000 mt, up by 30%, while arrivals from Iran were up by 102% to 279,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia of 114,000 mt were down by 56% while shipments originating in China of 53,500 mt were up from a mere 2,200 mt. Deliveries of\\n44,500 mt from Bahrain were up from zero and\\nCroatian arrivals of 31,000 mt were up by 101%. Romanian shipments of 9,500 mt were down from 59,000 mt in the prior year.\\nRussia captured the number one spot in July with 42,400 mt, followed by Ukraine with 37,700 mt. Libya reappeared with 14,200 mt while arrivals in July from Iran of 8,200 mt were down from 74,000 mt in July 2014.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSouth Africa: Imports up in July, but Jan-Jul lags\\nSouth African importers took delivery of 103,100 mt urea in July 2015, an increase of 67.4% on July 2014. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 48,500 mt were up by 197%. Russian deliveries via own ports were 24,500 mt and a further 16,500 mt shipped via the Baltic were registered as Estonian material.\\nThe January-July volume of 299,600 mt was nevertheless down by 4.3% on the same period in 2014. Arrivals from Qatar were however up by\\n17.2% to 123,400 mt while Saudi Arabia accounted for 76,500 mt, a drop of 19%.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Suppliers busy formulating IPL strategy\\nThe September 11 IPL tender for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by October 11 will undoubtedly attract significant selling interest, and speculation on prices likely obtainable by the importer is rife.\\nChinese urea will feature prominently, but recent aggressive quotes from traders offering Middle East product in Brazil are indicative of offers into India well below current targets around $270/mt FOB from China and other producers in the region.\\nRecent Brazilian trades into the very low $280s/mt CFR provided netbacks to the Middle East no higher than $260-262/mt FOB, and returns from contract markets such as Thailand are similar. US netbacks were also similar, but the minor September 8 spike in New Orleans barge values could be indicative of better returns in the short term.\\nShould Middle East producers opt to offer at similar numbers in India, this would suggest possible quotes from regional suppliers to IPL marginally below $275/mt CFR East Coast India (ECI) as requested by IPL for the session. This is basis freight around $10/mt, limited transaction costs, and relatively small margin to intermediaries where applicable. Mainstream quotes will be higher, but IPL will follow the traditional path of countering basis the lowest offers received. Iranian product is expected to feature at similar numbers, if not lower, for around 250,000 mt.\\nThe low end indicated would reflect returns just below $264/mt FOB China or Indonesia/Malaysia with limited provisions for costs and no margin. Freight from a fast port in northern China to ECI is assessed around $9/mt on a discharge rate of 10,000 mt/day, sundays and holidays included.\\nOffers and awards in recent tenders in Sri Lanka reflected netbacks to sellers of Chinese material well into the $260s/mt FOB, but these sessions permitted shipment through October and thus left room for traders to more confidently short the forward market. The strict October 11 shipment deadline imposed by IPL renders speculative offers at low numbers less likely to secure cover with a margin, given the recent depletion of inventories via shipments to MMTC.\\nWhile pressure to relieve existing inventories and disposing of September plus early October production in China will be considerable, the level suggested may be termed too low by Chinese producers now faced with an estimated $3/mt increase in costs due to the imposition of VAT. This cost is however largely offset by the lower value of the RMB. This provides increased returns in RMB terms, and may therefore not leave the door wide open for Iran and traditional Middle East suppliers to book a considerable volume with IPL.\\nTonnage from the FSU is not expected to feature at the low end suggested in the above. Freight and costs for supramax carriers from the Black Sea are assessed marginally above $22/mt, necessitating cover around $250/mt FOB to compete. Given September turnarounds and outage issues at DnieproAzot and OPZ plus likely sustained cuts in half of Group DF output, Ukrainian product will instead head for nearby markets, and Russian producers are also expected to seek better returns via alternative outlets.\\nIndia: Imports through June up significantly\\nIndian imports of urea registered by customs via GTIS in June of 342,400 mt were up by 124% on the volume imported in June 2014. Oman accounted for 174,000 mt and deliveries from Iran were 120,000 mt.\\nThe June arrivals lifted first-half calendar year 2015 imports to 4.02 million mt, up by 57% on the first half of 2014. Arrivals from China of 2.45 million mt were up by 71% while the 1.04 million mt shipped from Oman were up by 13.3%. Iranian producers enjoyed the largest relative increase via shipments of 474,000 mt that were up by 258% on 2014.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: Prices slide in slow market\\nGranular urea demand in Thailand remains subdued, and offers for prompt positions of Middle East material are now suggested available to importers at $278/mt CFR. This follows recent trades at an even $280/mt CFR.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S. Plains: AN unmoved in recent weeks\\nNeither the price nor truckloads of ammomium nitrate have moved in recent weeks, with untested postings sitting around $310-320/st FOB along the Arkansas River.\\nUS Atlantic Coast: Gavilon to discharge UAN at Norfolk\\nGavilon will discharge 23,000 mt of UAN-32 at Norfolk, Virginia around mid October. The cargo\\nwas purchased from Abu Qir this week at $183/mt FOB. This indicates a cost in the tank of about $205/st FOB with no margin.\\nRecent truck and rail sales of UAN from the US East Coast were cited at $6.72-7.03/unit FOB, which suggests at least a $10/st margin for the product.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nCentral America: Trammo books Incofe\\nThe September 4 Incofe tender for 10,000 mt AN plus 30,000 mt urea for October loading was booked by Trammo for loading from the Baltic.\\nThe importer declined to reveal pricing in the deal, but local reports indicate that the AN traded at $225/mt CFR while the urea was suggested booked around $283/mt CFR.\\nFreight for the combination to discharge in Guatemala and Nicaragua is assessed around $28/mt, indicative of a return to Trammo around $195/mt FOB for the AN and below $255/mt FOB for the urea with no provisions for margin.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot closes another UAN tender\\nGrodnoAzot closed an export tender for 10,000 mt UAN-32 on September 9 for October shipment. No further details were available at press time.\\nThe supplier\\'s 25,000 mt sale to Ameropa at $184-185/mt FOB under its August 31 tender is headed for Canada.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir sells 23,000 mt to Gavilon\\nAbu Qir has awarded Gavilon its September 9 tender for 23,000 mt of UAN at $183/mt FOB for September 14-17 lifting. Freight for shipment to the US East Coast is estimated at $37/mt providing delivered values around $220/mt CFR with the Ardmore Chinook in the frame for the voyage. Most or all of the cargo is expected to discharge in Norfolk, Virginia.\\nAMMONIA\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nIndonesia: CJ closes another 6,000 mt import tender\\nCJ Indonesia closed an import tender for 6,000 mt September 8 seeking product for October delivery. No further details were available at press time.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Tight availability prevails with higher price quotes\\nBlack Sea ammonia availability is tight with little cargo if anything available for September lifting. As such suppliers stress that prices can no longer be below $390/mt FOB.\\nNF Trading denies the sale of cargoes to Trammo for lifting on the Navigator Grace and Marycam Swan at the end of this month, claiming ammonia is being withheld possibly for use as a feedstock when Group DF restarts nitrogen production at Ukranian facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot. The units produce urea and ammonium nitrate (AN) and have been shut since May 2015.\\nOPZ confirmed it stopped production of ammonia and urea on September 8 owing to technical issues reported by its supplier of natural gas, with no gas being fed to the facility. The outage is expected to last one week.\\nEarly estimates predict ammonia and urea output will both decrease by one-third for September. This comes as one of OPZ’s two ammonia lines is under a 30-day maintenance shutdown which began at the end of August.\\nMeanwhile, it emerged that Ameropa will charter the Clipper Neptun from Koch for 60 days during October/November as its vessels the Gas Cobia and the Gas Manta go into drydock for 10-14 days. The likelihood it that she will be used as a mid-size vessel for contract commitments west of Suez, rather than being filled to her 40,000 mt capacity.\\nAmeropa has also chartered the Odin vessel for at least three years to replace the Cambridge which has been fixed for a similar period in the LPG market from Q4, 2015.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Strong July imports with more Algerian cargoes\\nTurkish ammonia imports in July 2015 reached 48,583 mt, an increase of 43% y-o-y on increased off-take from Ukraine and Algeria during the month.\\nTotal Turkish imports for the January to July period reached 311,837 mt, a decline of 8%.\\nTurkey imported the majority of its ammonia from Russia during the first seven months of this year at 191,073 mt, a 43% increase y-o-y.\\nImports from the Ukraine over the period were 78,397 mt, a decrease of 26%. Off-take from Algeria was 23,361 mt, up from zero in the previous year.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: FACT awards tender to Trammo at $505/mt CFR\\nFACT confirmed it has issued an award to Trammo for 7,500 mt at $505/mt CFR with 180 days credit terms following its 15,000 mt import tender which closed on September 3.\\nNo offers were submitted for the first 7,500 mt parcel requested to arrive on or before October 5. Trammo\\'s offer for the second 7,500 mt lot to arrive in Cochin October 11-15 was accepted.\\nThe $505/mt CFR price tag with credit equates to around $490/mt CFR after deduction of interest, discounting charges and other costs. This represents an increase of $17/mt on the August 24 tender award to CIFC on tightening supply east of Suez.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nTaiwan: CPDC acrylonitrile plant in early maintenance\\nCPDC said its downstream acrylonitrile plant will be taken down for maintenance from early October for three\\nweeks, reducing the buyer’s ammonia consumption next month.\\nThe shutdown had originally been scheduled towards the end of October but given the very weak acrylonitrile market this was brought forward.\\nThe buyer still pegs contract values around $460/mt CFR with Mitsui discharging 5,000 mt late September off the Gas Quantum and Gas Serenity respectively.\\nSouth Korea: SFC still negotiating spot purchase\\nSFC continues to discuss the potential purchase of 15,000 mt for second half October arrival with a trader. There is reported to be a $20/mt gulf between the buyer and seller regarding cargo pricing with SFC seeking $460/mt CFR or below.\\nNamhae has no current spot requirements with a steady stream of cargo deliveries. Yara will discharge 10,000 mt off the Viking River September 15-16 following a spot deal concluded mid-August. Trammo will discharge 15,000 mt off the Tobolosk September 19 under contract.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: Limited scope for imports\\nThe volume of confirmed DAP imports for calendar year 2015 to date is estimated at almost 650,000\\nmt. Added to this will be an Australian cargo for Chawla before the end of the year, details of which are not yet confirmed. In addition there are reports circulating of a Kailin cargo loading in China this month on the Ocean Kite.\\nThe buyer of this particular cargo has not yet been confirmed and has generated numerous rumours.\\nOther reports discussed in the market this week have concerned the pricing of the United Agro cargo due to load with Dayakou product through Quantum at the weekend. The price has now been confirmed in the upper $470s-480/mt CFR level as the sale was concluded prior to the recent drop in price.\\nNo cargoes have yet been confirmed as purchased in the $460s/mt CFR despite Fauji receiving offers sub $470/mt CFR against its most recent enquiry. The market has weakened with the Pakistan rupee depreciating by almost 3% over the past month leaving buyers\\' price ideas in the low-mid $460s/mt CFR. In addition global prices are weak and buyers are loathe to commit new tonnes while the price is on the decline.\\nWith uncertainty over the subsidy, importers have also been reluctant to return to the market until the issue is clarified. The Prime Minister is expected to take a decision very soon as to whether to re-introduce the subsidy on DAP through a \"deemed price mechanism\" (see last report) or instead to increase support prices for crops or, as it did last year, to do nothing at all.\\nThe outlook for demand going forward is looking less certain following a downward revision by the NFDC of estimated consumption for the current calendar year. A combination of low crop prices, in particular cotton and rice, an increase in the price of urea following increased gas costs to the domestic industry and uncertainty over the subsidy issue have reduced the scope for further imports.\\nConsumption of DAP for 2015 is estimated between 1.4-1.5 million mt which with production plus imports already at around 1.45 million mt, theoretically leaves little if any room for any significant quantities of imported DAP before the end of the year.\\nNevertheless, there is still potential interest and both Fauji and Engro are expected to book further tonnes before the end of the year.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Domestic market supporting DAP price\\nThe Chinese phosphate industry continues to evaluate the impact of the VAT introduced on September 1. At the same time, a steady stream of domestic deliveries are supplementing export loadings thereby relieving producers of any pressure to make new sales until later in the month for October shipment.\\nOfficial prices are still at or around the $460/mt FOB China but this does not reflect the real export price indications which have fallen in recent weeks in line with the depreciation in key Chinese DAP markets, namely India and Pakistan. Buyers in the latter market are quoting the low-mid $460s/mt CFR which would equate to the upper $440s/mt FOB China with a freight of around $17/mt. Chinese product has been on offer sub $470/mt CFR Kharachi, equating back to the low $450s/mt FOB China.\\nIn India some buyers are quoting even lower numbers, in the low-mid $450s/mt CFR, giving a netback $10/mt or more below depending on freight rates.\\nThese prices have not yet been done and most Chinese producers are not yet under pressure to agree such low numbers for September. Trader positions could be a different story but again nothing at the lower prices has yet been confirmed.\\nWith domestic prices at RMB 2,600/mt ex works still equating to a $460/mt FOB if not more, the industry is loathe to reduce its official export price indications for fear of having to then reduce price levels to the domestic market during this current season.\\nNevertheless lower prices are expected once the pull from the domestic market ceases and producers once again rely on the export market for business. Prospects for volume sales in both India and Pakistan are looking fairly dismal for Q4 with rabi consumption estimates in both markets revised down and this in itself could put pressure on Chinese prices.\\nThe industry has attempted to pass on some or all of the additional cost from the VAT to the domestic market in the way of higher prices, raising ex-works prices for DAP by RMB 100/mt to RMB 2,700 however this has not been successful so far and prices remain unchanged.\\nWith higher potash costs from the VAT, NPK prices are likely to increase. MAP prices are under pressure as demand from the NPK industry comes off slightly.\\nIndications for granular MAP for export, based on little or no demand, are said to be around $350/mt FOB for granular 11-44-0 and $400/mt for 10-50-0.\\nPOTASH\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nChile: SQM increases SOP sales\\nChile\\'s SQM exported 68,000 mt SOP between January and July, more than double the 29,000 mt exported in the same period during 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period SQM shipped 22,000 mt to Belgium, 13,000 mt to Brazil and 12,000 mt to Mexico.\\nIn the company\\'s recent H1 financial report it noted that revenues in its MOP/SOP division fell 26% to $220.4 million as volumes reduced 31%. MOP volumes took the brunt of reductions, while SOP volume increases and strong SOP prices during H1 helped limit the impact on revenues, the data show.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Potash imports up in July, down in fertilizer year\\nIndia imported 631,000 mt potash in July, an increase on 487,000 mt in the same month last year, according to FAI data.\\nHowever, total imports between April and July remain down roughly 200,000 mt at 1.3 million mt with April- June shipments down 300,000 mt during negotiations over new contracts to the region and the strike at ICL\\'s Dead Sea Works.\\nIn the first quarter of the fertilizer year India imported 737,000 mt of potash, according to GTIS data, which correlates with the FAI figures. BPC increased shipments to India between April and June to 261,000 mt from 164,000 mt previously, while Canpotex increased shipments to 146,000 mt from 129,000 mt, GTIS data show.\\nOn the other hand, Uralkali reduced shipments to 197,000 mt during the quarter from 253,000 mt, according to GTIS, while ICL reduced its shipments to 48,000 mt from more than 200,000 mt due to the strike earlier this year. APC volumes increased slightly to 81,000 mt from 72,000 mt.\\nThe rush of potash imports during July are believed to have continued into August, with sources saying that between 550,000 mt and 600,000 mt were imported during the month. If so, then imports for the first half of the fertilizer year are likely similar to slightly above the level imported last year.\\nDespite the larger volumes signed on yearly contracts earlier this year, current weak demand in India due to currency issues and deficient monsoon rains coupled with high stocks (404,500 mt at end July) has meant that the country may not surpass the 4.2 million mt imported during the fertilizer year 2014/15, but this depends on demand during the second half of the fertilizer year.\\nRainfall deficiency is currently at 14.3% of the long period average, with some key southern states seeing deficiency of close to 40% giving serious concern for demand in the Rabi season.\\nSULPHUR\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Volumes still constricted by low river levels\\nSuppliers of Russian sulphur have reported that persistently low river levels continue to cause their cargo loadings to be around half of typical volumes, potentially constricting supply.\\nIn addition, Russian availability will be further diminished in Q4 and Q1 during the northern winter season, as in previous years.\\nRussian sellers\\' negotiations for Q4 contract prices are likely to start later this month, according to sources.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Spot sulphur inactive; Q4 talks imminent\\nMorocco is reportedly inactive on sulphur spot markets at present and an OCP source suggested that the buyer had a backlog of pending arrivals and was comfortable with stock levels.\\nHowever, the source said that the buyer was receiving offers at “competitive levels”.\\nNegotiations for Q4 North African contracts should commence this months, and a decline from Q3 levels is likely given broader price declines in global sulphur markets. Contract levels for Q3 are assessed at $145- 150/mt CFR.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Mosaic seeking 12,000 mt for November\\nMosaic has entered the market with a tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid for delivery H2 November.\\nThe tender closes September 11.\\nEuropean sellers and traders have been waiting for Brazilian demand, as spot demand overall has been lacklustre in recent months. In addition, some recent Brazilian enquiries, including the previous Mosaic tender, were reportedly met by Chilean or Mexican supply.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Spot demand anticipated soon\\nThe Indian sulphuric acid spot import market is currently quiet, though sources expect further spot demand in the near future.\\nAlthough some sources reported that Indian requirements for all buyers have been met for the next few weeks, others suggest that PPL and possibly CIL are expected to re-enter the market soon.\\nSpot price ideas from India were reportedly in the $45-50/mt CFR range, but other market participants suggested that the mid-$50s/mt CFR would be more realistic.\\nAs previously reported, PPL in late August bought a cargo of around 11,000 mt for September delivery from Japan, and prices for the trade were reported from the high $50s/mt CFR to the low $60s/mt CFR range, above recent price ideas in the low-to-mid-$50s/mt CFR.\\nIn addition, PPL’s sulphur burner is currently expected to run from late October following a series of delays, and this would lead to diminished demand for spot acid.\\nHowever, one seller noted that they had continued spot enquiry from buyers, including PPL, and that the buyer was also seeking greater volumes on its long-term contracts.\\nNEWS\\nPEOPLE\\nPonce resigns as chairman of SQM holding companies\\nChilean potash producer SQM has recovered its share price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by 24% in the last month, with recent gains following news that Julio Ponce has resigned from the boards of its parent companies.\\nIn the twelve months leading until August 7 2015, SQM shares on the NYSE fell over 50%.\\nPonce, former son-in-law of General Pinochet, resigned as director and chairman of the four holding companies in control of SQM for \\'personal reasons\\', according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, adding to speculation that he may relinquish all control over the mining company.\\nThe resignation comes with SQM embroiled in a corruption investigation and dispute over its leases in the Atacama salt flat. SQM also saw an 18% fall in its revenues to $1.06 billion in H1 2015 due partly to reduced sales volumes.\\nFollowing a general meeting on April 24 SQM reshuffled its board amid allegations by Chilean authorities of tax evasion and corruption, Ponce stepped down after the company admitted evading taxes on $11 million in payments.\\nJulio Ponce had chaired SQM since 1987 and has been a controversial figure due to his connections to ex- Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, fines for insider trading and scandals over illicit political campaign financing.\\nPROJECTS\\nTogo awards $1.4 billion phosphate complex to Elenilto\\nTogo awarded a tender to develop a $1.4 billion phosphate complex in the West African nation to Elenilto, the group controlled by the Israeli billionaire Jacob Engel.\\nElenilto controls the consortium and is cooperating on the project with Chinese phosphate producer Wengfu.

Rates remain depressed as the BDI continues to battle further down to new lows. Charterers have been busy covering their stems before the Chinese festive season, but owners fighting to get their hands on any firm and fresh business, pushing the rates further down. Bunker prices have been somewhat volatile over the course of the week, it is to be seen what will happen next week when the Chinese are off.\\nSeeing more and more ships now already heading for, or seriously considering to lay up.\\nHANDYSIZE\\nCurrent trend: DOWN\\nIn Atlantic here has been yet another slow week with few fresh requirement and rates still under pressure. Still very few cargoes to East Coast South America, and the ones that enter the market are disappearing quickly.\\nIn the Far East there has been a slight increase in activity, with charterers wanting to cover before the holiday. However as owners want to cover as well, the rates being fixed are still under pressure.\\nOutlook: DOWN\\nExpect next week to be another slow week.\\nSUPRAMAX\\nCurrent trend: DOWN\\nSame as for other sizes there has been a slight increase in number of cargoes before the upcoming holiday. Freight levels being done are still under pressure though, as owners are equally, if not more keen to cover before next week. Some owners are accepting even negative return daily for hauls bringing them into the Atlantic. Still plenty of available spot tonnage around.\\nOutlook: DOWN\\nExpect the levels might drop further next week, assuming limited fresh requirements in the market, until the Chinese are back.\\nPANAMAX\\nCurrent trend: DOWN\\nInevitably the pressure remains on the owners and the hire rates, with a scramble to fix their tonnage before the Chinese New Year. The rates did however flatten out a bit in both basis, and for certain routes we are seeing an increase in levels. Ecsa still remains the driver but certainly less fresh activity in the area. Very few aussie or coal stems from Indonesia have been seen in the market, and owners are increasingly quiet about the levels to which they have fixed.\\nOutlook: DOWN\\nWe expect it to be quieter over the coming week\\nDISCLAIMER: The assessments above are provided by Bery Maritime\\nAS, a leading Fertilizer Freight Consultancy/Broker.

This being said, there has been a slight increase in demand for vessels in north china with several NOPAC grain and local fertilizer stems–so although rates have not come up, we have seen a touch more activity in the market. In SE Asia, the majority of activity is based on the Indonesian coal movement into India or south china.\\n.\\nOutlook: =/UP\\nFar east will hold its position, without any major alterations\\nPANAMAX\\nCurrent trend: =\\uf020\\nNo major adjustments from last week as ECSA still remains the center of activity in the Atlantic. The Baltic index however came up a tick but little has changed on the trade routes and the tone is relatively bearish. Pacific maintained its focus on NOPAC rounds and trips out of Indonesia but the time charter rates remained under pressure, with some competition from the smaller sized tonnage. There was little short period activity as rates continued to stay on the low side.\\nOutlook: =\\nThere are limited factors indicating an upswing and we believe the current trend will continue for rest of the month.\\nDISCLAIMER: The assessments above are provided by Bery Maritime\\nAS, a leading Fertilizer Freight Consultancy/Broker.

Nickel ore has been relatively slow with only a few cargos coming into play. The coal biz in SE. ASIA has been more active in comparison to the previous month and more enquiries coming to the market for china and India direction. For trips to china, the hire rate are still at very low levels.\\nOn the other hand, Atlantic market hardly encountered any major changes since last week.\\nOutlook: =/UP\\nThe slight upward trend is likely to continue, although some of the high reported numbers do not necessarily reflect the true improvement.\\nPANAMAX\\nCurrent trend: =\\nAnother week dominated by ECSA as vessels kept steaming in one direction. Time charter rates were up a tick as there was demand for spot tonnage for early to mid-June dates. In the east rates were rather flat with only a handful of NOPAC and Indo round stems seen in the market.\\nPeriod interest remained low as owners appeared unsure about the direction of rates.\\n.\\nOutlook: =\\nSentiment slowly picking up in the south Atlantic however much of it is being fuelled by ECSA alone, whereas in the East, the outlook has been relatively flat. Likely to continue next week as very little indicating otherwise.\\nDISCLAIMER: The assessments above are provided by Bery Maritime\\nAS, a leading Fertilizer Freight Consultancy/Broker.

Many steels and a handful of fertilizer cargos can be seen from Far East which is providing owners with more confidence, even if it could just be for the short term. There has also been number of ‘above market’ fixtures with India and PG direction. Southeast Asia is supported by coal back into India and other destinations, along with a slight increase in the number of nickel ore stems. Several short period fixtures have been seen, with slightly healthier numbers than anticipated.\\nOutlook: UP/=\\nThe market has shown some signs of improvement over the past few days and we expect this to continue for the coming week.\\nPANAMAX\\nCurrent trend: UP\\nTime charter rates went up across all routes as ECSA pulled in tonnage from North Atlantic, India and S.E Asia with decent time charter rates. In the east rates were tick up due to the general sentiment however the activity on NOPAC and Indo rounds remained low. There was short period interest but numbers discussed were on the lower side.\\n.\\nOutlook: UP/ =\\nThe current push in the market is fueled by ECSA and USG becoming active and pulling in ships from different corners, but it remains to be seen how long this change can help the rates to improve further.\\nDISCLAIMER: The assessments above are provided by Bery Maritime\\nAS, a leading Fertilizer Freight Consultancy/Broker.

Period rates for nice Supras and eco ultras has also been picking up, with noticeably more enquiries.\\n.\\nHANDYSIZE\\nCurrent trend: UP\\nWe have seen more coal and bauxite stems in South East Asia this week which is assisting to reduce the tonnage count.\\nThere has also been an increase in grain stems for the smaller sizes from Australia. In Far East, we have seen many steels and Fertz cargos with various directions, including backhaul. Several fixtures have been reported heading back into the Atlantic with healthier numbers also.\\nBoth S Atlantic and USG is picking up – with USG leading. Baltic/Continent is flat, with little movement and supply/demand in balance.\\nBlack Sea still soft whilst Middle East showing a firmer undertone.\\nOutlook: UP\\nWe expect the firming trend will continue into next week\\nSUPRAMAX\\nCurrent trend: UP\\uf020\\nOver the past two weeks the Pacific has showed noticeable improvements in time charter rates. Major cargoes including fertilizer/steels/coal /nickel ore have been active in Fareast and S.East Asia. Although there has not has been a huge surge in a particular commodity, it appears activity has picked up slightly all over, which is enough to take away a large number of vessels in both areas. Tonnage count remains high, but considerably less than that of 2 weeks ago. Period interests are also increasing.\\nOutlook: UP\\nA healthy flow of cargos is expected to come out between now and the end of July\\nPANAMAX\\nCurrent trend: UP\\nComing from a positive previous week for owners, the market continued to pick up with time charters rates performing better across all routes. Again ECSA was the driving factor, which was helped by the increase in activity from the North Atlantic. In the east rates appeared to come up also as ships were absorbed by ECSA and thus creating a demand for the Indo and NOPAC rounds. More short and longer period deals were also concluded this week.\\nOutlook: UP\\nECSA remains the center of attention and the reason for current changes on the Panamax size. We expect this to still be the case in the coming\\nDISCLAIMER: The assessments above are provided by Bery Maritime\\nAS, a leading Fertilizer Freight Consultancy/Broker.

Sources reported that a large quantity of NOLA tons were sold below Tampa prices, with the NOLA range quoted at $261-$271/st FOB.\\nSources said the drop was justified by falling prices in the Cornbelt, as well as less ammonia earmarked for Mosaic, which announced it would be cutting DAP production. Ammonia producers also saw natural gas prices drop below $2.00/mmBtu again last week.\\nMarchNYNEXnaturalgasclosed Feb.4at$1.972/mmBtu, compared to the Jan. 28 close of $2.182/mmBtu one week earlier.\\nEastern Cornbelt: After the prior week’s sizable drop in ammonia prices in the region, which was spurred by new post- ings from large players, sources said spot pricing levels were still holding at $420-$425/st FOB regional terminals in early February, with the low in Illinois and the upper end in Indiana.\\nAlthough sources reported no one needling for still-lower ammonia prices last week, they also confirmed that “no one is knocking the door down, either.” Both dealers and retail buyers “are still holding out to make sure they get the lowest price,” said one contact, even with unconfirmed reports of some regional suppliers offering limited price protection for new ammonia orders.\\nOnesourcesaidthenewlowerpostings“havereallyscrewed up the market,” undermining efforts by some regional sup-\\nU.S. Gulf NOLA\\npliers to hold prices to the prepay levels that had initially yielded some spring commitments. “Some doors have been closed, so to speak,” said one regional contact.\\nWestern Cornbelt: The ammonia market was steady at $360-$415/st FOB in the Western Cornbelt, with the low quoted in Nebraska and the upper end FOB terminals in central Iowa and Missouri. Delivered tons were pegged at $360-$380/st in the region from southern production points.\\nSouthern Plains: The anhydrous ammonia market had reportedly slipped to $280-$285/st FOB on the low end out of some regional production points, with the upper end of the regional range quoted at $340/st FOB pipeline terminals.\\nSouth Central: The anhydrous ammonia market was quoted at $380-$420/st FOB in the region, down $25/st or more from last report, with the low at Memphis, Tenn., and the upper end FOB Henderson, Ky.\\nBlack Sea: Pressure is being applied to producers to accept prices as low as $240/mt FOB. The main force is coming from Morocco, where OCP is trying to use its large-scale purchases to get lower prices.\\nSources said at least for now, $240/mt FOB is not achiev- able. Prices are in the $250s/mt FOB for the limited tonnage that is available.\\nMiddleEast:Arab producers are long on material. Sources said Sabic in particular is being hit hard by weak demand and buyers demanding lower prices for product.\\nNamhae reportedly concluded a purchase at $350/mt CFR into South Korea. Sources said the netback on the deal came to $270-$275/mt FOB.\\nUREA\\nU.S. Gulf: Prompt granular barges moved last week, start- ing the week as low as $187/st FOB and then climbing to $205/st FOB before firming near that number.\\nSources said there was a lot of activity, with CF coming into the market to buy four or five barges, but not at the high end of the range. By Thursday, February product was being offered at $206-$208/st FOB and March at $210/st FOB.\\nPrills remained hard to gauge, with the last done piece of prompt business called $225/st FOB. Second-half February tons were called $220-$230/st FOB. Overall, product is re- ported to be scarce, although Yara is reported to be bringing in a Libyan vessel soon.\\nEastern Cornbelt: Granular urea continued to be quoted at $235-$250/st FOB regional terminals in early February, with the low reported in Cincinnati, Ohio, for prompt tons.\\nWestern Cornbelt: The granular urea market remained flat at $245-$255/st FOB in the Western Cornbelt.\\nSouthern Plains: Granular urea was quoted at $245-$250/st FOBCatoosa,Okla.,downsome$5-$15/stfromlastreport,with inventories continuing to be described as tight due toArkansas River logistics. “Urea has begun to arrive by barge in the Tulsa market, but early barges are going to cover contracts, so spot product is still limited,” said one source.\\nSouthCentral: The South Central terminal market contin- ued to slip, but some sources speculated that price declines may be reaching their limit. “Buyers are still on the sidelines, but I’m getting the feeling that we may be at the bottom,” said\\n2Green Markets® February 5 © 2016 Kennedy Information, LLC, A Bloomberg BNA Business All Rights Reserved.

The urea market FOB Memphis was pegged at\\nthe $240/st FOB level in early February.\\nSoutheast: Granular urea pricing had reportedly slipped to $275-$280/st FOB port terminals in the Southeast, down another $5-$10/st from last report. One source said rail-DEL tons could also be had at the $275/st level on a spot basis in early February.\\nSources continued to report a “very slow” fertilizer pace in the region, due both to wet weather and to cutbacks in wheat acreage. One Carolina contact said growers in his area would do some wheat topdressing “as soon as the weather changes,” but volumes would likely be only half of normal due to acreage reductions.\\nAnotherregionalcontactreportedaslightuptickinfertilizer orders in early February, saying he’d “taken more orders in the last five days than in the last two months.” Low inventories continued to be reported throughout the region, however. “We’re theoretically three weeks away from the field here,” noted one source.\\nIndia: The government reported that imports were right on the mark for 2015. Industry watchers estimated India would need to import 8-9 million tons in 2015, and govern- ment figures released this week showed 2015 imports at 8.85 million tons.\\nBesides the public tenders conducted by MMTC, STC, and IPL, India imports urea from a joint venture operation in Oman. The output of that plant regularly supplies material to India. Just this week, a shipment of 43,000 mt from the Oman facility was unloaded at Vizag.\\nSources said India is in no rush to start its 2016 buying. With prices showing no sign of rebounding, sources said the Indian buying houses appear to be willing to wait until the last minute to issue the first tender of the year. Earlier predictions of a tender call in early March are now being pushed back to late March or early April.\\nThe new fiscal year starts April 1. Sources said the level of subsidies available for urea will be clearer by mid-March. ReportsoutofIndiaarealreadyindicatingthatthegovernment is looking for ways to reduce the amount it pays in subsidies. The lower international price is a big help in that effort.\\nThe government is also putting its support behind building new urea plants, renovating existing facilities, or re-opening shuttered plants to cut down on the amount of imported urea. Government officials argue that it is cheaper for the govern- ment to provide support to the domestic producers than to keep importing urea.\\nChina: Production started to slow down in early February in anticipation of the Lunar New Year Golden Week to take place next week.\\nOne trader said expectations are that domestic demand will kick in when everyone returns to work after Feb. 15,\\nand this has provided a small bump in urea prices. Traders with short positions reportedly moved quickly to nail down cargoes before domestic demand affected prices.\\nOne source worked prices back to the mid-$180s/mt FOB basedonadealtoThailand.Traderssaid,however,thatthedeal was for product from Kuwait and not China. They cautioned against using a China-equivalent price in calculating prices.\\nAdvocates argue that recent small cargoes of granular product to South Korea also have netbacks in the mid- to upper-$180s/mt FOB.\\nThe general consensus, however, has Chinese granular in the $200-$205/mt FOB range, with prills at $195-$200/mt FOB. Sources said the dominant prill price under discussion with producers is closer to the $195/mt FOB level than to the higher end of the range.\\nMiddle East:An explosion along a natural gas pipeline in Egypt forced the urea producers to go offline for 2-4 days. Mediareportssaidtheexplosionwascarriedoutbyopponents of the current government.\\nUrea traders said the shutdown will have little impact on the market. One trader noted that the world is awash in urea. He pointed out that southern Europe is buying from China and theArab Gulf, when normally Egypt, other NorthAfrican plants, and Yuzhnyy would have an edge into the European market. Now, however, with product prices and freight rates so low, material can come all the way from northern China and be competitive.\\nA sale of 20,000 mt to Thailand from Kuwait may have pushed the price in the mid-$180s/mt FOB, said one trader. Other sources maintain the price has not yet dropped below $190/mt FOB. They are saying, however, that no one would be surprised to soon see prices in the mid-$180s/mt FOB.\\nAdding to the pressure on Arab producers are soft U.S. NOLA prices and strong pressure from Brazil for lower prices. One trader said the lack of demand from Pakistan and Bangladesh also means suppliers have to look elsewhere, and buyers everywhere are demanding lower prices.\\nIndonesia: The Indonesian government continues to hold off on its tender to find companies to handle its urea exports.\\nSources said this week that the government and produc- ers are having a hard time accepting the low global prices. One trader said nothing will happen in terms of arranging for exports – including an auction – until prices move back into the $230s/mt FOB.\\nThe last bit of public business was just as the last year closed. Prices in those deals put the Indonesian market at $210-$220/mt FOB. No sales have occurred so far this year because no new export permits have been issued.Traders said theonlymovementthisyearhasbeenproductthatshouldhave been shipped by Dec. 31. The delays in shipment, said one source, were tied to demands by buyers for cheaper prices.\\nNepal: The Nepal government closes a tender Feb. 15 for 20,000mtofurea.ThetenderincludescallsforMOPandDAP.\\nThe product is to be bagged and delivered to a Nepal warehouse on the Indian border.\\nPakistan: Urea sales in Pakistan during the 2015 calendar year are expected to see a meager decline of 3 percent, to 5.560 million mt versus 5.705 million mt during 2014.\\nAll Rights Reserved.

Urea inventories piled up as a result, which forced manufacturers to reduce bagged urea prices in November and December 2015. This led to sales of 623,000 mt in November and 782,000 mt in December.\\nNITROGEN SOLUTIONS\\nU.S.Gulf:Price ideaswere $155-$160/st($4.84-$5.00/unit) FOB based on the latest offers being made into the market.

Reproduction Prohibited by Law.\\nwww.FertilizerPricing.com\\nPoised to record a small price drop for the week prior to the news, the prompt DAP market edged higher in the hours following the announcement, to a range of $312-$325/st FOB. New offers were generally quoted around $327/st FOB on Feb. 4, although some were offering as high as $335/st FOB, sources said.\\nFirst-quarter paper firmed as well, coming in at $315- $326/st FOB, although March physical was reported as low as $305/st FOB for DAP and MAP.\\nMosaic’s announcement comes amid tumbling global phosphate prices. NOLA DAP is down approximately 28 percent versus February 2014, and MAP’s decline has been even more pronounced. Extreme weakness in the Brazil MAP market – down more than 35 percent from the year-ago – played a part as well, limiting opportunities for offshore sales.\\n“Mosaic believes that current market prices do not reflect the value we see for our products,” a Mosaic spokesperson said. “We are not participating nor selling at the low price seen in Brazil today, and at NOLA in the last few weeks.” While some market players were quick to point to the curtailment as sparking the market, others were unconvinced. “The curtailment announcement is mostly smoke and mirrors. It won’t have much effect,” said one trader, while simulta- neously acknowledging the firmer market. “Paper jumped a little overnight. I think possibly (it was) some short-covering\\njust in case this Mosaic thing has an impact.”\\nWhile stagnating commodity levels and prodigious NOLA supply have commonly taken the blame for the recent soft market, observers have increasingly pointed to delayed spring purchasing for the continued weakness.\\n“It was a supply issue, but lately that’s shifted,” said one trader. “There’s just not enough demand out there to get rid of everything that’s available. What we need now is to get into the season, get things going.”\\nAdditional supply is expected soon at NOLA. Sources anticipate a Moroccan cargo on or around Feb. 10, and a vessel loaded with 30,000 mt of DAP and MAP was report- edly due in March.\\nThe NOLA DAP market was quoted in a range of $312- $325/st FOB, up from $310-$323/st FOB at last report.

Although there were still reports of suppliers “waiting for barges to arrive” after earlier high-water restric- tions, other sources said more tons seemed to be available at the port in early February. MAP was quoted in the same range as DAP at the port.\\nThe 10-34-0 market had reportedly slipped to $475-$495/st FOB in the Southern Plains, down some $10-$20/st from last report. “In comparison to four months ago, there is now no problem finding 10-34-0,” said one regional contact.\\nAgrium’s Feb. 1 phosphoric acid postings include $1,050/st of P2O5 for rail-DEL SPA and MGA in Kansas and Colorado, and $1,065/st of P2O5 for rail-DEL tons in Oklahoma and Texas.

Yara invested $5 million in the equipment and facility enhance- ments, which are capable of forming, filling, sealing, and stacking 2,000 bags per hour. “Yara is highly committed to Californiaagricultureandtothedynamicneedsofthegrowers in this region,” said Jorgen C. Arentz Rostrup, president of Yara NorthAmerica. “This new equipment adds even greater flexibility to our already comprehensive service and product line available in California and on the West Coast.” Yara’s Stockton GatewayTerminal has capacity to store up to 80,000 tons of dry materials. The state-of-the-art bagging line is fed by a series of conveyors that carry fertilizer to the line from bulk storage areas. The equipment then forms a bag from a roll of preprinted plastic, which is filled, sealed, and placed on a pallet for storage and eventual shipping.Also automated is the “hood” that is created from plastic sheeting to cover the pallet for added protection, further ensuring product quality. The company said the investment is an example of Yara’s commitment to supplying the important West Coast market with crop nutrition products in a timely manner. Yara broke ground on the $21 million Stockton dry terminal in 2008 (GM Feb. 25, 2008) and completed construction in 2009, reporting at that time that it planned to store and distribute urea, sulfate of potash, calcium nitrate, and the company’s portfolio of dry specialty products from the Stockton facility. In December (GM Dec. 9, 2015), Yara reported that it had signed an agreement to acquire the assets ofWest Sacramento Nitrogen Operations from Agrium Inc. for $27 million. Yara said it will utilize the Sacramento site as an import terminal for finished products, with storage capacity for both dry and liquid fertilizers. The Sacramento facility was formerly\\na UAN manufacturing site, and had traditionally imported anhydrous ammonia as a raw material for UAN production. In addition to Stockton and Sacramento, Yara also operates California terminals at San Diego and Port Hueneme.\\nMidwest Fertilizer bonds eyed by investors\\nPosey County, Ind.—Indiana’s Posey County is expected to issue an already secured $1.259 billion of tax-exempt debt this summer in what bond analysts are calling one of the tax exempt market’s largest-ever junk-bond sales, according to Bloomberg. “I think they’ve got a buyer base that is comfort- able with the credit,” a bond salesman told Green Markets. The funds will go to fund the $2.6 billion Midwest Fertilizer Co. plant (GM Jan. 29, p. 1), which is expecting a mid-year groundbreaking.Theprojecthasbeenproposedforsometime, and short-term debt has been issued while Midwest has put the project together. The outstanding short-term notes will be redeemed on Aug. 2, according to Bloomberg, and at that point Posey County could issue the 30-year notes. The notes were made available under the Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008. Midwest is majority-owned by Pakistan-based Fatima Group. Similar financing was used for OCI NV’s Iowa Fertilizer Co. nitrogen facility in Wever, Iowa. Cur- rent production capacity totals are put at ammonia 800,000 mt/y, UAN 1.565 million mt/y, nitric acid 560,000 mt/y, urea 790,000 mt/y, and diesel exhaust fluid 315,000 mt/y. “I think at this point NorthAmerica becoming self-sufficient for urea and UAN is guaranteed,” said Green Markets SeniorAnalyst Neil Fleishman.\\nARA announces policy priorities for 2016\\nWashington—TheAgriculturalRetailersAssociation(ARA) on Feb. 2 announced its policy priorities for 2016.

ARA reiterated its position that “Congress must require OSHA to conduct formal rulemaking before implementing any change to the PSM retail exemption.” ARA also targeted EPA’s expanded definition of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act, saying “Congress must block EPA’s WOTUS regulations,” and amend (Na- tional Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permitting “to protect applicators from duplicative requirements and legal liability.” ARA said it supports reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and a return to two-year budgeting cycles for the WRDA “to ensure Congress provides sufficient resources and oversight of key inland waterway projects,” including construction of new locks on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and other inland waterway systems.ARAalso said it supports a federal GMO labeling standard through the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which “would reaffirm the FDA’s role as the authority for food safety and labeling requirements” instead\\n12Green Markets® February 5 © 2016 Kennedy Information, LLC, A Bloomberg BNA Business\\nAll Rights Reserved.

The second agreement is for the R&D; of new solutions for next generation fertilizer products by inte- grating biological and chemical crop nutrition technologies.\\nLouis Dreyfus reportedly eyeing partners\\nRotterdam—Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV is reported to be looking for strategic partners for its Fertilizers and Inputs business rather than an outright sale, according to Bloomberg. The commodities trader confirmed in early January it was evaluating “all options” for the Fertilizers\\n&Inputs business, following speculation it was looking to sell the unit (GM Jan. 8, p. 13; Jan. 1, p. 14). The company, which also is reported to be looking for strategic partners for its metals, dairy, and orange juice business lines, is said to be seeking industry partners that could help improve the units rather than financial investors. Bloomberg sources\\nreported the proposed partnership deals could involve the sale of stakes for cash or shareholding swaps in a move to ring-fence the four business units, some of which already operate separately, from the rest of the company. The commodities trader also is said to have appointed Credit Suisse Group AG to seek options for the Fertilizers and Inputs unit. A spokeswoman for Louis Dreyfus Commodi- ties told Green Markets this week the company’s previous statement still stands (GM Jan. 8, p.13) and it has nothing further to share at this stage. Louis Dreyfus Commodities integrated all of its fertilizer activities under the Macrofertil brand after acquiring DFI, a major distributor of fertilizers and crop protection products based in South Australia, in 2013. Today, the commodities trader offers fertilizers in over 24 countries using local logistics networks (GM Jan. 1, p.14). The move to seek potential partnerships for the four business units – apparently now deemed to be outside the commodities trader’s core business – is seen as part of a strategic plan by the Louis Dreyfus holding company to shore up its finances and reduce investment after a decade or more of rapid growth. Louis Dreyfus Holdings is believed to own 85 percent of Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV.\\nOCP inaugurates new plant\\nMorocco—OCP inaugurated a new 1 million mt/y DAP/ MAP plant at its Jorf Phosphate Hub at Jorf Lasfar Feb. 1. The output of the new plant, known as the Africa Fertilizer Complex (AFC), will be targeted entirely for the African market. The Dh5.3 billion ($537 million) plant includes a 1.4 million mt/y sulfuric acid unit and a 450,000 mt/y phosphoric acid unit, as well as 200,000 mt of fertilizer storage capacity. Three more or less identical plants, each with 1 million mt/y of DAP/MAP production capacity, are being developed at the Jorf Phosphate Hub.\\nAnglo reports lower phosphates output/sales\\nLondon—Anglo American plc reported a 3 percent drop in sales volume in 2015 by its phosphates business unit, Anglo American Fosfatos Brasil Ltda. (Copebrás), which is up for sale (GM Jan. 15, p. 13; Oct. 23, 2015). Copebrás sold 1.060 million mt of phosphates last year, down from 1.097 million mt in 2014. All products except “low analysis” fertilizers\\n–typically SSP – experienced a downturn in sales volume. Sales of low analysis fertilizers grew 1 percent, to 938,100 mt from 927,700 mt in 2014, while sales of high analysis fertil- izers – MAP and TSP – were 6 percent lower at 172,700 mt, down from 184,700 mt. Copebrás produced 1.34 million mt of phosphate concentrate, 5 percent less than 2014’s 1.42 million mt. Output of phosphoric acid was 10 percent lower at 265,100 mt,downfrom295,000mt,anddicalciumphosphateproduction was also 10 percent lower at 147,300 mt. Phosphate fertilizers productionwasmarginallydownat1.111millionmt,compared with 1.113 million mt in 2014.AngloAmerican is targeting the sale of its phosphates and niobium businesses – both based in Brazil – in a single transaction. First-round bids for those assets are reported to be due on Feb. 15.\\n14Green Markets® February 5 © 2016 Kennedy Information, LLC, A Bloomberg BNA Business\\nAll Rights Reserved.

The company achieved a 7 percent increase in the production of urea, to 1.186 million mt, and a 6 percent increase in merchant ammonia output, to 825,000 mt compared with the previous year. But output of ammonium nitrate and its derivatives was largely flat at 2.928 million mt in 2015, against 2.940 million mt the previous year. Production of complex fertilizers increased 18 percent to 617,000 mt, while MAP production was up 150 percent year-on-year, to 104,000 mt from 41,000 mt, reflecting a reduction in unscheduled downtime hours.\\nSamarco close to deal with Brazilian authorities\\nRio de Janeiro & Melbourne—Brazilian iron ore miner Samarco Mineração SA and its joint owners, Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd., are expected to reach an agreement this week with Brazilian authorities on a deal to pay damages and costs for Samarco’s tailings dam burst in November, according to media sources quoting Brazil’s Attorney- General Luís Inácio Adams. The deal, which is expected to be finalized later this month, is reported to require Samarco to cover all costs of social and environmental programs, rather than paying the set amount of R$20 billion (US$5 billion) that was originally sought (GM Jan. 29, p.17). As a consequence, the final bill could prove more (or less) expensive for the iron ore miner over the 10 years or more the process is anticipated to take. Vale and BHP would be required to guarantee the financial settlement.\\nThe Andersons launches two new products\\nMaumee, Ohio—TheAndersons Inc. Plant Nutrient Group plans to launch Foltec SG, a foliar nutrient technology that consists of a propriety combination of dry soluble granules (SG) that quickly solubilize in the spray tank, at the Golf Industry Show Feb. 6-11. The company said Foltec SG is a complete nutrition product that reduces the need for a complex tank mix using a wide variety of products. Foltec SG is available in three formulations and include a high N, high P, and high K formulation. The Plant Group has also launched Crop Coach, a web application that generates product recommendations based on nutrient deficiencies. The online crop strategist allows users to create a custom- ized crop system that maximizes yield and profitability. The company said the application integrates seamlessly with tissue test data from A&L; Great Lakes Labs. Users may also enter plant tissue test nutrient levels from any lab or explore the application manually. It said Crop Coach provides at-a-glance information on the macro and micro- nutrients required for a healthy crop, as well as features, benefits, and physical properties of the company’s line of specialty products.

Despite being well-known for production of other mineral commodities like trona and bentonite, Wyoming hasn’t had an active phosphate mine for 35 years. In the study, CarnesdescribedtheimportanceoftherockthatWyominghosts in pockets in a central band across most of the state. While it is relativelyabundantthroughoutthestate,Carnesconcludedthat only one area would be likely to draw any commercial interest due to varying problems associated with each major concentra- tion. However, he said that area, the Phosphoria Formation in Teton County in the Snake River Range near Hoback Junction, would likely have its own problems.Acompany with leases to drill for natural gas near the headwaters of the Hoback River eventually had to walk away from the project, as outdoors- men and other activists said they wouldn’t be welcomed. The Trust for Public Land purchased the leases for $8.75 million to prevent the wells that could have been drilled. Still, Carnes said he expected his study to draw interest for new phosphate exploration and resource evaluation.\\nZuari Agro buys out Rotem Amfert in fert jv\\nGurgaon, India—Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd. has bought out itspartner,RotemAmfertNegev,intheirjointventurecompany Zuari Rotem Speciality Fertilisers Ltd., which produces water- soluble NPK fertilizers in India’s Maharashtra state for sale throughout India. Zuari Agro is reported to have paid about $2 millionforthe50percentstakeownedbyRotemAmfert,which is a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd. ZuariAgro reported in a regulatoryfilingthatZuariRotemSpecialityFertilisersbecame a subsidiary of the company effective Dec. 11, 2015. Zuari Agro and Rotem Amfert established the 50:50 joint venture in July 2007 (GM Aug.6, 2007). The plant, which is located in Baramati in Maharashtra state and has a production capacity of 24,000 mt/y, began operations in March 2010 and was the first Indo-Israel collaboration in the Indian fertilizer sector. Zuari Agro is part of the Zuari group of companies owned by the Indian conglomerate Adventz.Group. In November 2015, Zuari Agro signed an MOU with the UAE’s Ras Al Khaimah Maritime City to set up an integrated 1 million mt/y DAP plant in the emirate. The $800 million project includes a power plant, a private jetty, and a desalination plant. The facilities are planned to be built over 400 acres in the free trade zone of Ras Al Khaimah Maritime City.\\nZuari Group plans P expansion at MCFL\\nMangalore, India—After securing a controlling stake in Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd. (MCFL) in May 2015 through its subsidiary Zuari Fertilisers and Chemicals\\nAll Rights Reserved. Reproduction Prohibited by Law.\\nwww.FertilizerPricing.com\\nLtd., the Zuari Group plans to invest Rs3 billion ($44.9 million) to double phosphate production capacity at MCFL. According to local media, Zuari is looking to double phosphate fertilizer production capacity at MCFL’s plant at Panambur, near New Mangalore Port in Karnataka state. MCFL currently has capacity to produce 280,000 mt/y of DAP and NPs. Zuari plans to make the final investment decision in early 2016, according to media reports. MCFL also operates a 380,000 mt/y urea plant at the Panambur site. The Zuari Group acquired an additional 36.56 percent holding in MCFL, making it the majority shareholder, with a 53.03 percent stake. Prior to the purchase, Zuari held a 16.47 percent stake in MCFL.\\nAfrican Potash inks urea deal with Windmill\\nHarare, Zimbabwe—U.K. junior potash miner African Potash announced that it has completed a fertilizer trade deal with Zimbabwe-based fertilizer producer Windmill (Pvt) Ltd. Undertheagreement,AfricanPotashdelivered3,000mtofurea to Windmill\\'s warehouse in Harare, Zimbabwe, with African Potash reportedly receiving net revenue of $300,000 from the trade.African Potash said the agreement is significant not only for the near-term revenue it generates for the company, but also fortheimportantadditionalaffiliationitforgesbetweenAfrican Potash and a major player in the company’s target market of southernAfrica. The urea was purchased from Beryl Holdings Pty Ltd., a South African investment firm with whom African Potash signed an agreement to collaborate on fertilizer trading operations in southern and eastern Africa. Under the terms of the deal, Beryl’s main fertilizer trading activities – which include trading, logistics, and financing – will be restructured and operated via a newly formed Mauritian company that will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of African Potash. Beryl’s current share in logistics company Bollore Logistics South Africa is expected to enhance the value of the partnership, with Bollore likely to enter into a trading relationship with the Mauritian company. In August 2015, African Potash reached a trading agreement with the Common Market for Eastern and SouthernAfrica (COMESA) and the MaskAfrica Crowd Farm FundLtd.(MACFF)tocreateaverticalplatformforthemining, production, and distribution of fertilizer, focused on Africa’s eastern and southern COMESAstates region and beyond (GM Aug. 17, 2015). Prior to that, the potash junior had focused on developing its Lake Dinga potash project in the Republic of Congo. African Potash announced late last year that it had bought 8.75 million shares in U.K.-based investment company Blenheim Natural Resources plc, representing 4.74 percent of the share capital of Blenheim.\\nRum Jungle inks MOU with Japanese firm\\nDarwin, Australia—Australian junior resource company Rum Jungle Resources Ltd. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a major Japanese trading house for the potential future offtake of sulfate of potash from its portfolio of sulfate of potash projects in the Northern Terri- tory, Western Australia, and South Australia. The identity of\\nthe trading house has not been disclosed, but is described as having a significant Australian presence. Rum Jungle said the two parties would formalize ongoing information flow and engagement regarding the progression of the resource company\\'s potassium brine projects. Depending upon the progression of these projects, the Japanese trading house may consider entering into binding offtake agreements for SOP products from any of Rum Jungle\\'s potassium brine projects. Rum Jungle Managing Director Chris Tziolis said that while the MOU is non-binding and did not represent a commitment at this time, the Japanese firm was considered a preferred offtake partner for distribution of product into certain Asian markets.\\nUnverferth unveils new liquid fert applicator\\nKalida, Ohio—Unverferth Manufacturing Co. Inc. is prom- ising optimum performance from its new NutriMax liquid fertilizer applicator, which Unverferth says helps ensure optimum crop performance through precise placement of nutrients when most needed during periods of high plant growth. According to Unverferth, the NutriMax applicator features a rugged design for high-speed operation and an extra-tall 36” of toolbar crop clearance for a longer ap- plication window. The patent-pending side-folding toolbar also provides a best-in-class narrow transport width of 14’9”. The toolbar is available in sizes of 60’, 66’, 88’, and 90’. The 60’ model folds to 40 feet for dual-width ap- plication. The center frame section is constructed of dual 5”x 7” tubes and a single 6”x 6” tube on the outer wings for enhanced durability.\\nScotts buys stake in Bonnie Plants; on track with TruGreen\\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Co., Marysville, Ohio, said Feb.\\n2 that that it has bought a minority stake in Bonnie Plants Inc., Union Springs, Ala., the largest provider in the U.S. of potted vegetables and herbs, sold to gardeners through a variety of retail outlets. Bonnie is owned by privately-held Alabama Farmers Cooperative (AFC), Decatur, Ala.\\nScottsboughta25percentstakeinBonnie,accordingtoAFC sources, and Scotts said the deal gives it the ability to increase its ownership over time. In a call with analysts, Scotts said $72 million was associated with the Bonnie transaction, however, it did not return calls for further clarification. Scotts said the acquisition will approach $0.10 earnings per share of accretion nextyearfortheexistingbusiness,notincludingtertiarybenefits thatitbringstoMiracle-GroandotherbrandsthatScottsalready sells. It expects a logical lift in those areas as well.\\nAs part of the agreement, Scotts will also provide Bonnie with exclusive marketing, and research and development services to edible gardening initiatives.\\n“Our relationship with Bonnie dates back decades when we worked together on marketing programs that helped propel the Miracle-Gro business,” said Jim Hagedorn, Scotts chairman and CEO. “There is no finer brand in the live goods category than Bonnie, and the benefits from this partnership\\n16Green Markets® February 5 © 2016 Kennedy Information, LLC, A Bloomberg BNA Business\\nAll Rights Reserved. Reproduction Prohibited by Law.\\nwww.FertilizerPricing.com\\nfor both sides are obvious and significant. We look forward to working with the Bonnie team to drive the gardening category to new heights.”\\nHagedorn noted that Scotts has experimented with its own brands in the live goods market on several occasions, but said the company has never been able to build the momentum that it wanted in this growth market. He said the company wanted to be more than just a chemical company. “The growth rate in edible gardening has been in the mid high-single digits over the past five years,” he told analysts. He said it was also “extremely popular with millennials,” and he believed Scotts can further accelerate its growth and popularity.\\n“As leaders in our respective live goods and consumer prod- ucts categories, our companies have enjoyed a longstanding history together and the Bonnie Plants family welcomes this opportunity to formalize our deep-rooted relationship with ScottsMiracle-Gro,” says Stan Cope, Bonnie Plants president. “Thisinvestmentallowsustoenhanceandgrowourbusinessby combining ScottsMiracle-Gro’s marketing and R&D; expertise with our expertise in plant production through our national greenhouse operations and widespread retail distribution.”\\nBonnie Plants will continue to operate as an independent organization, led by Cope. A management committee with representatives from both organizations will oversee any joint business operations. The deal has been approved by the AFC board and is expected to close in late February 2016, provided that certain conditions are met including AFC membership approvals and the restructuring of existing financing.\\nBonnie Plants touts that it is the largest and only national supplier and producer of vegetable and herbs in the U.S. It grows more than 250 varieties of vegetable and herb plants for gardeners across the country, with 72 growing stations serving the 48 contiguous states. Established in 1918 by Bonnie and Livingston Paulk, the company is led by Cope, their grandson. Bonnie Plants are available at every Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Lowe’s, and 4,700 independent garden centers in the 48 contiguous states provides their plants in biodegradable, plantable pots.\\nAFC, founded in 1936, is an agricultural cooperative with 37 member associations, including approximately 90 retail locations and over 2,300 employees.\\nIn other merger and acquisition news, Scotts says its plan to merge its Scotts LawnService business with TruGreen (GM Dec. 14, 2015) is on track to close in the second quarter.\\nIn another product area, Scotts told analysts it is extremely focused on the organic space and is committed to converting the majority of its gardening business to organic, though em- phasizing it would do so without asking gardeners to sacrifice product quality for performance. This will be Scotts’ second full-year with its Nature’s Care organic line in the market- place, and it says it has added sales and promotional support.\\nCentral Garden tanks up on Earth Juice, exits fertilizer private-label contract\\nCentral Garden and Pet,Walnut Creek, Calif., reported a 17 percent increase in sales for its first quarter ending Dec. 26,\\nNew Research from Green Markets®\\nAgronomist Compensation Survey 2015\\nFind out if your agronomist pay is at odds with current market rates!\\nDetailed\\ncompensation data on an increasingly\\nAll new data critical role!\\nincludes:\\n•2015 Salary and Bonus Data at the US Regional Level\\n•Salary expectations for 2016\\n•Tenure’s Impact on Compensation\\n•Managerial Responsibility’s Impact on Compensation\\n•Specialization’s Impact on Compensation\\n•Certification’s Impact on Compensation\\n•Analysis of benefits and other perks\\n•And much more!\\nAgronomist Compensation Survey 2015 is delivered to in PDF format, for only $497.\\nOrder online: www.fertilizerpricing.com/research/ AgCompSurvey2015\\nAll Rights Reserved.

Hydro-Organics is known for its Earth Juice-branded products. Central Garden provided no further details about the transaction. It did, however, confirm more details about two Pet-related 2015 acquisitions, saying it paid $61 mil- lion for National Consumer Outdoors Corp., a pet bedding company, and $23 million for IMS Trading Corp., a rawhide and pet treat distributor.\\nThe company told analysts Feb. 2 that the private-label fertilizer contract was no longer profitable and was not with a core retailer. It said the private label business remains im- portant to the company and it remains bullish on that segment in general, saying “it gives us more critical mass, a bigger share of the shelf,” and drives manufacturing efficiencies, which benefits its branded business as well.\\nThe company also walked away from its seasonal décor business, i.e., artificial Christmas trees, etc. It said it expects little or no impact on its bottom line from the décor or fertil- izer changes.\\nAs far as where it stands versus ScottsMiracle-Gro, the company told analysts that in the areas where the two com- pete, it is confident that has it held or taken market share in all of those areas. Central Garden recently revealed that for fiscal 2015 some 65 percent of its Garden sales came from three big box stores: Walmart at 31 percent, Lowe’s at 18 percent, and Home Depot at 16 percent. Company-wide, the three represented 31 percent: Walmart 16 percent, Lowe’s eight percent, and Home Depot seven percent.\\nAs for the 17 percent first-quarter uptick in sales, most of that increase was from its Pet segment. Sales were up only three percent, to $111.1 million in Garden, due primarily to stronger grass seed sales as well as higher sales of other manufacturers’ products.\\nGarden reported a seasonal loss of $3.3 million, improved over the year-ago loss of $3.5 million. Garden’s operating margin improved 40 basis points, more than offsetting a decline in segment gross margin. Grass seed, fertilizers, and other manufacturers’ products were the biggest contributors to the operating margin increase, offset somewhat by lower margins on bird seed.\\nThe company reported a loss of $8.6 million ($.0.18 per share) compared to the year-ago loss of $5.7 million ($0.12 per share).\\nChemChina makes $43 B offer for Syngenta; board recommends approval\\nSyngenta AG announced on Feb. 3 that China National Chemical Corp. (ChemChina) has offered to acquire the company for more than US$43 billion (US$465 per ordinary share). The offer is equivalent to 480 Swiss francs per share based on the Feb. 1 exchange rate, and includes a special dividend to be paid conditionally upon and prior to closing.\\nSyngenta’s board of directors unanimously recommended the offer to shareholders, saying it believes the proposed transaction “respects the interests of all stakeholders.” Syngenta also reported that there is committed financing for the deal and a strong commitment to pursue regulatory clearances.\\nA Swiss and U.S. tender offer will commence in the com- ing weeks and the transaction is expected to conclude by the end of the year, subject to regulatory clearance. Syngenta’s existing management will continue to run the company.After closing, a ten member board of directors will be chaired by Ren Jianxin, chairman of ChemChina, and will include four of the existing Syngenta board members.\\n“In making this offer, ChemChina is recognizing the quality and potential of Syngenta’s business,” said Michel Demaré, chairman of Syngenta. “This includes industry- leading R&D; and manufacturing and the quality of our people worldwide. The transaction minimizes operational disruption; it is focused on growth globally, specifically in China and other emerging markets, and enables long-term investment in innovation.”\\nDemaré said the company will continue to operate under the Syngenta name and will remain headquartered in Swit- zerland, which he said reflects the country’s “attractiveness as a corporate location.”\\nCiting several lawyers who deal with security reviews of such transactions, Bloomberg reported that a U.S. national security watchdog is likely to examine whether the deal would compromise American food security, and whether the combined company’s locations would be too close to U.S. military bases.\\nThe deal is the largest-ever acquisition by a Chinese company. ChemChina said it is committed to maintaining the highest governance standards with a view to an IPO of the business in the years to come.\\n“The discussions between our two companies have been friendly, constructive, and cooperative, and we are delighted that this collaboration has led to the agreement announced today,” said Jianxin. \"We will continue to work alongside the management and employees of Syngenta to maintain the company’s leading competitive edge in the global agricultural technology field.”\\nBloomberg reported that ChemChina first approached Syngenta last spring, but negotiations stalled as Syngenta fielded and ultimately rejected a number of takeover bids from Monsanto Co. Monsanto’s final offer was submitted in August and valued at $47 billion (GM Sept. 7, 2015), but Syngenta’s board rejected the bid, saying it “significantly undervalued the company and was fraught with execution risk.”\\nChemChina reportedly made an offer around US$446 per share (449 Swiss francs) in November, but negotiations between the two companies didn’t move into high gear until December when DuPont and Dow Chemical Co. announced their $66 billion merger (GM Dec. 14, 2015).\\n“Syngenta is the world leader in crop protection, having significantly increased its global market share over the last ten years,” said John Ramsay, Syngenta CEO. “This deal will\\n18Green Markets® February 5 © 2016 Kennedy Information, LLC, A Bloomberg BNA Business\\nAll Rights Reserved.

It will ensure continuing choice for growers and ongoing R&D; investment across technology platforms and across crops. Our commitment to cost and capital efficiency will remain unchanged.”\\nHeadquartered in Beijing, ChemChina is the largest chemical corporation in China, with production, R&D;, and marketing systems in 150 countries. The company’s main businesses include materials science, life science, high-end manufacturing, and basic chemicals. ChemChina currently ranks 265th on the Fortune 500. The company posted sales of $41.2 billion in 2015, and has 140,000 employees.\\nSyngenta ranks as the world’s largest pesticide producer and the third-largest global seed business, with total annual sales of $15.1 billion. The company employs some 28,000 people in more than 90 counties.\\n“Our vision is not confined to our mutual interests, but will also respond to and maximize the interests of farmers and consumers around the world,” said Jianxin. “We look forward to Michel Demaré remaining on the board as vice chairman and lead independent director, and to working with John Ramsay and the management and employees of Syngenta to deliver safe and reliable solutions for the continued growth in global food demand.”\\nPhosAgro boosts phosphate fert sales\\nRussian fertilizer producer PhosAgro reported a 12 per- cent increase in sales of phosphate-based fertilizers and monocalcium phosphate (MCP) in 2015, to 5.27 million mt compared with 4.71 million mt in the previous year. Nitrogen-based fertilizer sales were marginally lower (-1.4 percent), falling to 1.37 million mt from 1.38 million mt. Sales of phosphate rock (excluding intra-group sales) fell\\n18percent year-on-year, to 1.96 million mt from 2.39 million mt in 2014.\\nProduction of phosphate-based fertilizers and feed phos- phates increased 12.2 percent during 2015, to 5.35 million mt, while nitrogen-based fertilizers output was 4 percent higher at 1.43 million mt. Phosphate rock output rose 4.7 percent, to 7.85 million mt last year.\\nPhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev said despite 2015 being another challenging year in terms of the macroeconomic environment, the company managed to increase its total fertilizer production by 10.4 percent year-on-year, to 6.79 million mt from 6.15 million mt. The company’s output, he said, had benefited from a steep rouble devaluation at home while selling in U.S. dollars. He added that by the end of 2015 PhosAgro’s annual fertilizer production capacity had reached 7 million mt as a result of continued investment in the modernization of production facilities.\\nSales to Europe increased by over 30 percent year-on-year to 1.25 million mt in 2015, and with new trade offices in the region (at Zug, Switzerland, and Warsaw, Poland) now open, Guryev believes the company can achieve even better results this year. The CEO reported the company’s sales to India increased “dramatically” in 2015, reaching 700,000 mt. In\\na press interview this week, he said Indian consumption [of fertilizers] was racing ahead thanks to low oil prices, which allow farmers to spend more on fertilizers. He hopes this positive trend will continue in 2016, as well as an improve- ment in Latin American performance, which he described as “weaker” due to low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region.\\nDespite a difficult start to the year for Russian farmers, PhosAgro said it had maintained sales volumes to the Russian market at the same level as 2014, with 1.6 million mt supplied to domestic customers in 2015. Guryev is optimistic about the outlook for the domestic market, given that government support has encouraged many farmers to expand production across all agricultural segments.\\nGuryev thinks the market is nearing the bottom and believes that initiatives like curtailing production will help clear out excess stocks. “This will naturally affect demand ahead of the spring planting season, helping buyers be confident that they can enter a stable fertilizer market without concern that prices may fall further,” he said.\\nIn terms of demand for the spring planting season, PhosA- gro’s portfolio of orders consists primarily of complex fertil- izers that are ready for direct application by end customers and are not blended like DAP or MAP. “We intend to stick to our plan of increasing production capacities for complex fertilizers, which are sold to high-margin markets and will not put pressure on prices for concentrated phosphate fertil- izers,” Guryev said, adding that the company is particularly focused on increasing its sales of complex fertilizers and NPS in its priority domestic and regional markets.\\nPhosAgro sales volumes\\n1 Excluding intra-group sales\\n2 Ammonium polyphosphate solution\\nSource: PhosAgro\\nMosaic, from page 1\\nMosaic has recently benefited from drops in ammonia and sulfur prices, but those have not been enough to stave off\\nAll Rights Reserved.

Sources particularly noted declines at NOLA and Brazil; Mosaic said it will not participate in either at current levels (GM, see p. 7).\\nThe NOLAmarket saw a very slight bump up in pricing last week after the news, with some sources remaining skeptical about the impact (GM, see p. 7), pointing to imports soon to hit the shore. Others suggested that other major producers may have been quietly cutting back as well, and plants in China are expected to run at a bare minimum during next week’s Lunar New Year (GM, see p. 8).\\nLess DAP being produced also means less ammonia being used, so sources last week gave that as another reason for a sharp drop in NOLA ammonia prices (GM, see p. 2).\\nCF, CHS, from page 1\\nand the supply agreement connects us to a reliable partner who will take ratable delivery of product across the year.” “This is an important day for CHS member-owners as we not only complete the single largest investment in our history, butmoreimportantlyestablishlong-termdependablenitrogen fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency, and opportunity for economic value,” said Carl Casale, CHS president and CEO. “This is a strategic decision about adding value for our member cooperative- and producer-owners on par with the significant investments made in our energy and grains\\nbusinesses over our 85 years of operation.”\\nCHS has purchased a minority equity interest in CF Ni- trogen for $2.8 billion effective Feb. 1, 2016.

The two companies marked the start of the strategic rela- tionship with an event for CHS fertilizer customers at CF’s Port Neal Nitrogen Complex. Expectations are that CHS will be supplied from CF facilities at Donaldsonville, Port Neal,\\nYazoo City, Miss., and Woodward, Okla.\\nCHS has said the deal with CF will meet about 46 percent of its annual nitrogen needs (GM Oct. 5, 2015). CHS also opted last year to axe plans to build a $3 billion nitrogen plant in Spiritwood, N.D., and pulled out a urea offtake agreement to buy urea from the proposed Summit Texas Clean Energy Project (GM Sept. 14, 2015).\\nPemex, from page 1\\nare integrated, noting that Pemex can offer financial benefits including the supply of raw materials, strategic infrastructure logistics, and a competitive global market for natural gas.\\nPemex said this acquisition confirms its commitment to the domestic agricultural sector, supporting the goals outlined in the National Development Plan and the initiatives of the federal government for the sector, thus increasing the pro- ductivity of the areas sown and improving farmer income in the Mexican countryside.\\nThe company noted that Mexico currently has a supply of fertilizers inaccessible for most of the smaller farmers. It said this acquisition seeks to reconstitute the domestic industry and guide the product towards sectors with lower levels of economic development, located in the south-southeast region, by providing a product of international quality at competitive prices.\\nPemex said this new capacity, together with the ammonia capacity of the petrochemical complex Cosoleacaque and production to be obtained in the nitrogen fertilizer plant that is being rehabilitated in Coatzacoalcos (GM Sept. 21, 2015), will allow Pemex fertilizer production to reach almost 3.5 million mt/y with a turnover of about $2 billion, putting the company in the top 15 production companies and distributors of fertilizers in the world.\\nInformation has been obtained by Green Markets from sources believed to be reliable.

Offer levels into Brazil have also moved higher. Nola price levels have also moved back up above $200/ short ton FOB.\\nThere is the view that this move was inevitable as prices had moved down too quickly, but the move has happened earlier than people expected.\\nHowever, with the urea market still fundamentally oversupplied and no real demand prospects on the horizon to support any sustained recovery in the market, sentiment remains weak overall.\\nProducers may be more comfortable now for February, but there is still availability and March is still open from all origins.\\nHigher prices in the US domestic market will likely make it more attractive as an import market, but this has yet to start and end user buying for spring has not yet got underway. There are expectations that European spring demand should kick in soon. But demand from Brazil remains slow and India is not expected to return to the market until late March at the earliest.\\nblack sea\\nIn Yuzhny, business has been heard for February shipment in the low/ mid-$190s/tonne FOB this week, with several traders buying at these levels. The price is assessed at $190-195/tonne FOB this week as a result.\\nOffers were heard at $200/tonne FOB during the week and there was talk that Dnipro had sold some tonnes at this level, but this could not be confirmed.\\nBuyer price targets in Turkey and Europe are understood to reflect lower netbacks, but no new business has been confirmed this week and would not likely be supported by suppliers at present.\\nNF Trading has no spot availability in February and has no plans to move cargoes to Turkey or Italy this month, but instead will supply the domestic market.\\nIn the paper market, February and March bids and offers are at $190- 195/tonne FOB.\\nbaltic\\nShort positions have been covered out of the Baltic this week, with sales heard in the low-$180s/tonne FOB up to $190/tonne FOB. SBU has been linked to some of the business to traders.\\nThere was talk of a producer offer now at $180/tonne FOB.\\nEarly in the week, bids were indicated at $160/tonne FOB but these have now moved higher. There was talk of a sale of Baltic prilled urea\\nto Turkey reflecting a netback in the mid-$160s/tonne FOB, but this has not been confirmed and so not included in the price range.\\nPhosAgro says it is fully sold out for February and is in discussions for March business, with enquiries for open destination on an FOB basis.\\nUralchem, Grodno and SBU are understood to still have tonnes available for February shipment.

Business was heard at $215/tonne FOB for a total of 25,000 tonnes of granular urea to two traders for Europe. While one trader purchased 20,000 tonnes in two lots another bought 4,000-5,000 tonnes at $215/tonne FOB. OCI/EFC was linked to the deals but the producer has denied any sales at this level.\\nOCI/EFC sold $222/tonne FOB into Europe for prompt shipment this week.

It remains to be seen whether it will be sustainable especially as market participants will gather at the TFI conference in Orlando next week. It is not clear whether other producers are thought to follow suit.\\nIn Asia, the market is subdued ahead of the Lunar New Year next week. DAP prices are under pressure, as producers will start focusing on the domestic market, with some plants undergoing maintenance.\\nWest of Suez, the Tampa DAP benchmark remains unchanged due to a lack of business. The domestic DAP market is under pressure following Mosaic’s announcement and imported product due to arrive at Nola.\\nOn the supply front, PhosAgro has announced it is planning to increase complex fertilizers and NPS sales in the domestic and regional markets. This move might take some pressure of an oversupplied market that is facing weak DAP/MAP demand and low prices.\\nDAP US GULF FOB AND NORTH AFRICA FOB PRICE COMPARISON\\nGreenstar Fertilizers is planning to double its phosphoric acid production capacity as part of a $47m expansion plan.\\nThe company will increase its production capacity from 75,000 tonnes/ year to 150,000 tonnes/year, will build an additional ammonia storage facility with a capacity of 15,000 tonnes and install an additional unit to produce 600,000 tonnes/year of DAP in the next three years.\\nThe phosphoric acid expansion will take 12 to 18 months and at the moment the company is in the process of getting environmental and other clearances.\\nIn Pakistan, United Agro is understood to have bought 30,000 tonnes of Australian DAP from Quantum at $392/tonne CFR shipped in January.\\nThe DAP price range has been moved notionally to reflect this deal.\\nIn Bangladesh, no award has been heard under the 20 January BCIC tender for 10,000 tonnes (+/-5%) of phosphoric acid (52-54% P2O5).\\nIn China, no large-volume export deals were heard because inventories in India were ample and demand was limited.\\nGolden Barley delivered 4,000 tonnes of Chinese cargoes to Malaysian NAFAS in the low-$370s/tonne CFR. Freight is estimated at $5/tonne, so the price range has been decreased to $365-370/tonne FOB.\\nThe domestic DAP market remained bearish. Market participants were waiting for an improvement in winter storage after the Lunar New Year holiday next week. The bearish fertilizer market dampened the DAP market sentiment. Distributors were not active in buying and few buy-out deals were heard. Offers for 64% DAP at Yingkou port were at CNY2,600/tonne EXWH, flat from last week. Offers for 64% DAP in Xinjiang were at CNY2,900-3,000/tonne ex-station, down by CNY100/tonne at the low end.\\nOverall operating rates of domestic DAP plants were stable around 55%. Yuntianhua shut three lines, with a total capacity of 1.8m tonnes/year.\\nKailin is heard to have postponed its scheduled maintenance to February.\\nThe MAP market remained soft this week. Deliveries and discussions became more limited with the Lunar New Year holiday in sight. Downstream compound fertilizer producers mainly have completed their pre-holiday purchases of MAP. Only a few MAP producers were still delivering cargoes. Traded prices for 55% domestic MAP powder were largely at CNY1,800-1,850/tonne. Discussions were still done on a case-by-case basis. Export orders were very scarce this week.\\nASIA\\nIn India, the market is subdued, as buyers are waiting for the announcement of the new budget and subsidies at the end of February. Also, DAP stocks are heard to be high and sufficient for six months.\\nThere has been a rumour in the market that Aries sold Chinese DAP at $380/tonne CFR, but this has been denied by the trader.\\nNo offers have been heard under the MMTC 27 January purchase tender for 80,000 tonnes (+/- 20%) of DAP.\\nOverall operating rates at domestic MAP plants was at 40-50%. Many producers in Hubei cut their operating rates recently. Large producers in Sichuan have shut plants for maintenance in advance ahead of the holiday.\\nYunnan Three Circles-Sinochem Fertilizers ran its MAP unit around 50%.\\nStocks of DAP in Beihai are heard at 47,000 tonnes, while stocks at Zhangjiang total 120,000 tonnes of DAP and 40,000 tonnes of TSP.\\nA vessel was fixed to load 10,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid at Jiangyin\\nICIS accepts no liability for commercial decisions based on the content of this report.

Market fundamentals remain weak and the mood bearish. Next Black Sea business is expected to take place at a lower level, with demand from the US not forecast to materialise until at least early March.\\nMosaic will significantly reduce DAP and MAP output for at least the next eight weeks.

The producer commissioned one of its large fertilizer units this week, hence why so much ammonia has moved to the Atlantic port in recent weeks.\\nEast of Suez, FACT India scrapped its second tender in as many weeks after it failed to attract any offers. The group immediately reissued the enquiry, but suppliers are sceptical it will find any product given the February and March delivery windows are exactly the same.\\nIn Asia Pacific, Namhae purchased 15,000 tonnes of Australian spot material from Yara at $347/tonne CFR Yeosu, well below the $375- 380/tonne CFR Ulsan agreed between Mitsui and SFC for 7,000 tonnes last month. Namhae also secured 10,000-13,000 tonnes of Black Sea spot ammonia from Koch, although that price is above that agreed with Yara.\\nICIS accepts no liability for commercial decisions based on the content of this report.

Average operating rates for DAP were around 55%, with MAP at 40-50% in China. Internationally, phosphate operating rates were cut because of poor demand and high levels of inventories of both sulphur and phosphates.\\nTasweeq’s February price announcement at a reduction of $30/tonne, followed by ADNOC which moved its price down by $17/tonne were received with mixed reviews.\\nA number of traders sounded rather disgruntled about Tasweeq’s decision to move its February price to $89/tonne FOB Ras Laffan.

No indications were given as to what the price might be.\\nThe Middle East price range has moved down at the high end to represent ADNOC’s February OSP.\\nASIA\\nIn China, prices moved down again this week driven by poor demand and lower prices published by Middle East producers. Price assessments were made largely on a notional basis by traders who said virtually no spot trades had taken place. Bids were heard in the $80s/ tonne CFR, but traders believed this to be price testing since buyers were sufficiently covered leading up to the holidays.\\nIt was no longer possible to do business at $100/tonne CFR, with $85- 95/tonne CFR deemed reflective, most sources agreed.\\nThe only trade noted as for a cargo of crushed lump sulphur from the FSU which sold in the mid-$80s/tonne CFR.\\nThe short and near term outlook remains hazy and sources say it will not be clear if the market will weaken further or start to recover on renewed demand until the middle of February.\\nAt Nantong, the local market was bearish, with offers moving towards $102-107/tonne CFR. Most cargoes negotiated were to be shipped in March. Some lower prices were also heard because supply and vessel capacity varied in different regions. Some Chinese buyers counterbid at above $90/tonne CFR. Most domestic traders took a wait-and-see stance before the holiday. In addition, more cargoes are expected to arrive at Nanjing port later because the unloading of liquid sulphur in Shandong was restricted. At Qingdao, sentiment was also subdued. Offers for Japanese and South Korean liquid sulphur were largely stable at around $100/tonne CFR, with deals negotiated in the mid- $90s/tonne CFR amid limited supply. Some deals were shifted to Yangtze River ports, partly because of the solidification of crushed lump sulphur. However, some market participants said overseas suppliers were unwilling to offer for large volumes and their lower spot offers were only available to contract buyers. At Fangcheng, large downstream producers adopted a wait-and-see stance, intending to keep prices under pressure.\\nThe following cargoes were heard arriving at the ports:\\n•45,000 tonnes of granular sulphur from Kazakhstan at Nantong for a trader\\n•40,000 tonnes of granular sulphur at Zhenjiang for a downstream producer\\n•66,000 tonnes of granular sulphur at Fangcheng for various owners\\nInventories at the major ports increased by 60,000 tonnes week on week.\\nChinese-Formed Sulphur Inventory Levels, ’000 tonnes\\nThe Chinese domestic market was bearish. Buyers began to stand on the sidelines ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Small- volume deals for granular sulphur were concluded at yuan (CNY) 860/ tonne at ports along the Yangtze River and a few deals for crushed lump cargoes packed in bags were concluded at Qingdao. Large downstream producers at Fangcheng port adopted a wait-and-see stance towards the import and spot markets.\\nAt Nantong, cargo-holders in the spot market were not affected by the official offers in Qatar and were waiting to see the post-holiday market movements. Offers for granular sulphur were CNY860-870/ tonne, with deals negotiated at the same level. Some lower offers for futures cargoes were available. Offers were at CNY840-850/tonne for granular sulphur at around CNY830/tonne for crushed lump sulphur, with lower prices heard. Some major downstream producers said they would not buy from the futures market or Sinopec Puguang Gasfield because the domestic and the overseas phosphate markets were bearish. Some downstream producers negotiated on a hand-to-mouth basis. Counterbids for spot granular sulphur were at CNY850/tonne. Counterbids for futures granular sulphur were in the low CNY800s/ tonne, while those for futures crushed lump sulphur were at similar levels. Traders were under cost pressure and preferred to pay attention to the market after the holiday. Some downstream producers bought small-volume granules at around CNY860/tonne.\\nAt Qingdao, granular sulphur was notionally pegged above CNY900/ tonne. Traders at the port were less active and downstream chemical producers were on holiday. Most negotiations were about bagged crushed lump sulphur. Some small-volume deals, ranging from dozens of tonnes to several hundred tonnes have been agreed at CNY890- 900/tonne. Some downstream producers were not able to pay in cash and prices of deals with a payment period were equivalent to CNY875-880/tonne in cash. In the domestic market, some refiners cut their EXW prices.\\nAt Fangcheng, prices were above CNY800/tonne. Downstream producers bid lower to drag down prices, with import prices taken as a reference. Some deals for granular sulphur were said to have been completed at CNY830-850/tonne since last week, but some cargo-holders were reluctant to sell at such levels. With import prices dropping further, downstream producers concluding deals earlier said they were reluctant to purchase at CNY830-850/tonne. The market for domestic sulphur saw a broad price range. The price gap between solid and liquid cargoes was also wide, with prices heard ranging from over CNY700/tonne to over CNY800/tonne.

The facility would have produced more than 2,400 tonnes/day of ammonia, which would have been further converted into urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).\\nUnder the new investment, CHS will be entitled to semi-annual profit distributions from CF Nitrogen based on the volume of urea and UAN purchased under the supply agreement.\\nCHS is entitled to 1.1m tons (997,920 tonnes) of granular urea and 580,000 tons (526,176 tonnes) of UAN annually, which represents approximately 8.9% of CF’s total production capacity once its expansion projects are completed this year in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa.\\n“We are pleased today to start our strategic venture with CHS, beginning the next chapter in a mutually beneficial long-term relationship. The venture will deliver attractive returns to CF shareholders as the equity investment helps support our longstanding capital allocation priorities and the supply agreement connects us to a reliable partner who will take rateable delivery of product across the year,” said CF president and CEO Tony Will.\\nCHS CEO Carl Casale echoed the positive outlook for the nitrogen venture and believes it will also add value for the cooperative’s members.\\n“This is an important day for CHS member-owners as we not only complete the single largest investment in our history, but more importantly establish long-term dependable nitrogen fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and opportunity for economic value,” said Casale.\\nICIS accepts no liability for commercial decisions based on the content of this report.

PhosAgro produced 12.2% more phosphate-based fertilizers to 5.35m tonnes, while output of nitrogen-based fertilizers rose by 4% to 1.43m tonnes. “2015 was another challenging year in terms of the macroeconomic environment... Despite a difficult start to the year for Russian farmers, we managed to maintain sales volumes at the same level as 2014, with1.6 million tonnes supplied to domestic customers in 2015,” said PhosAgro’s CEO Andrey Guryev.\\nThe company said during 2015 it had increased sales to Europe by 30% year on year to 1.25m tonnes while it said sales to India had risen “dramatically” to 700,000 tonnes during the year.\\n“Latin American market performance was weaker as a result of low soybean prices and economic challenges facing the region,” added Guryev.\\nphosagro 2015 sales volumes up 8.9%\\nPhosAgro’s total sales volumes in 2015 rose 8.9% year on year to 6.64m tonnes despite “challenging” conditions, prompting the fertilizers major on\\nfertoz set to advance canada project\\nAustralian fertilizer developer Fertoz Limited said that during the upcoming quarter it plans to order or lease equipment for the\\n\\nWhat are the main benefits\\nof switching to the ICIS Dashboard?\\n•Timely and flexible access to pricing data, news and analysis\\n•Integrated view of pricing and market data to support your commercial decisions\\n•Fully customisable view of market information that’s important to you\\n•Benchmark pricing data, related news and analysis on a single screen\\n•Export data and charts to integrate into your own systems analysis work\\nAccess this report via the ICIS Dashboard\\nwww.icis.com/dashboard\\nICIS accepts no liability for commercial decisions based on the content of this report.

The Wapiti East project is located 850km (528 miles) northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia and covers 15,838 hectares.\\nIt is the company’s North American flagship project and one of five company phosphate operations in British Columbia.\\nA scoping study for the project was completed in 2015 and was based on a staged open pit development with expectations it could reach 75,000 tonnes/year by 2018. If construction is completed this year, the firm is projected to produce 10,000 tonnes in 2016 and increase that to 35,000 tonnes by 2017.\\nCompany officials have previously said the quality of the Wapiti East resources enhances the attractiveness of the potential production of phosphate, especially to the surging organic fertilizer market.\\nAt 10% available phosphate, the site can provide better rates than is available in known phosphate producing areas like the US and Peru, where deposits typically only reveal 6-7% rates.\\nIn additional updates on it Wapiti, the firm said that it plans to continue field trials, product certification and evaluation for the phosphate products that it will be creating from the project.\\nIt also plans during the upcoming period to achieve increased progress on the 75,000 tonne/year small mine application that needs to be filed and approved for the next stage of development at the British Columbia site.\\nagrimin begins brine trials at sop site\\nAgrimin Limited has started brine evaporation trials at its Mackay sulphate of potash (SOP) project, the Australian fertilizer developer announced on Thursday.\\nThe Perth-based firm said two initial trials will be conducted by Independent Metallurgical Operations (IMO) at its facility and that Agrimin’s technical team will work closely with IMO staff to carry out the trials over an estimated 75-day period.\\nOfficials stated that the evaporation trials will utilise the 5,000 litre brine sample collected from the Mackay project and will produce potassium sulphate bearing salts for input into subsequent process testing efforts.\\nThis test work will allow for further development of the process flow sheet for integration into the scoping study and that the final SOP\\nproduct will also be used by potential development and off-take partners for testing and verification purposes.\\nA detailed mass balance and process simulation study was completed in 2015 and showed that the Mackay project has appropriate characteristics for the production of SOP using conventional solar evaporation and processing techniques.\\nAgrimin is currently focused on the advancement of the MacKay project in Western Australia which covers 2,457 square kilometres and is a site where initial estimates have projected there is mineral resources of 22m tonnes present.\\nAgrimin has previously said it anticipated completion of the project’s scoping study during the Q1 period.\\nsalt lake to start sop project study\\nSalt Lake Potash said that, based on positive test results at its Lake Wells potash project, it will initiate a scoping study and has begun discussions with potential engineering firms for that phase of the planned sulphate of potash (SOP) project in Western Australia.\\nThe firm, which was operating as Wildhorse Energy Limited until December, had previously announced a maiden resource estimate of approximately 29m tonnes and said the trials recently concluded has confirmed brine at depth and permeable rock, which is thought would provide a substantial aquifer for extraction at the site.\\nOfficials said the company has also commenced laboratory isothermal evaporation trials on bulk brine samples to define evaporation patterns and establish estimates for salting points.\\nAn updated mineral resource estimate is underway which will incorporate the latest testing results and Salt Lake is planning to start pump testing of the aquifers which will measure the hydraulic properties present.\\nThis past June the then-named Wildhorse closed its acquisition of Australia Salt Lake Potash, which provided the company with two large salt lake brine projects in Western Australia that were being developed to produce SOP for domestic and international fertilizer markets.\\nOfficials have previously said one benefit of the acquisition of the Lake Wells site was that it has substantially high evaporation when compared to other brine potash projects like those located in the US within the state of Utah and also in western China.\\nAll assessments in this report are made according to the published methodology, found at icis.com/compliance.

Business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs. Smaller forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA.\\nLittle other UAN is reported available with Abu Qir yet to issue another export tender. GrodnoAzot also reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32.\\nDespite the CF export business to France and Argentina, US UAN values have not firmed and inland distributors report US producers are responding rapidly to prompt demand for more UAN.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nDemand from Brazil remains one of the few AS market drivers with supplier offers still reported at $160- 170/mt CFR. Recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being though. Caprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160- 170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.\\nTCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR providing netbacks around $130/mt FOB.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nThe May 26 Yara annnouncement of a €50/mt drop in the price for CAN for new season deliveries in Germany to €225/mt CIF highlighted an otherwise slow week in trading in solid nitrates. While so far not announced by Yara, the price for Germany will also apply for deliveries in Benelux.\\nExports of AN from the FSU remain limited, but a slight uptick in netbacks was evident over the week despite the concerns on financing in Brazil as highlighted in the above.\\nImporters in Turkey cite offers for AN at attractive forward prices, and may opt to purchase early rather than wait for the traditional summer lull basis prices indicated by sellers that reflect netbacks to FSU producers substantially below current numbers.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Market mostly watching with CF exports\\nDomestic barge trades were thin this week for UAN-32, leaving most of the market to focus on recent CF Industries\\' export commitments of around 130,000 mt. Traders report that 100,000 mt is committed to France, while the 30,000 mt balance is covering a sale to Argentina. Indications based on enduser values in those markets suggest a net to the producer of about $180/mt FOB US Gulf or roughly the equivalent of $160/st FOB in a barge, allowing for loading costs.\\nWhile this is far less than recent spot domestic business around $240/st FOB New Orleans, CF is expected to increasingly participate in the export market to balance its supply against increasing output from other US inland producers, including the OCI plant under construction in Iowa.\\nUS Midwest: UAN demand steady but application delay\\nThe US Midwest region has been wet throughout much of May, but has not suffered through the flooding reported in many states to the south. However, overall movement of all products is down as much as 40% in some areas compared to historical averages for the month. However, none of this is worrisome to distributors as they fully expect to make up sales during June. Even though little UAN has been used in the region, distributors report retailers are ordering more than expected in many areas.\\nUAN pricing in the remains at $9.22-9.63/unit FOB. UAN demand is benefitting from the recent wet weather, as much of the corn ground remains too soggy for ammonia application equipment. In addition, corn growth has been more rapid than in prior years. This week\\'s US Department of Agriculture survey found 74% of the expected corn crop had emerged nationwide, compared to the five-year average of 62%. As the corn gets taller, ammonia application becomes less attractive and anecdotal evidence suggests farmers and retailers are buying more UAN and urea to ensure proper nitrogen applications in coming weeks for corn in the region.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic: GrodnoAzot scraps latest UAN-32 export tender\\nGrodnoAzot reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32. This follows the scrapping of its May 11 session for the same volume.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: CF sells up to 100,000 mt UAN to Invivo\\nCF Industries has sold as much as 100,000 mt UAN-32 into Rouen to Invivo with the first 35,000 mt shipment already fixed. The business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs.\\nSmall forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA with some sellers still holding back from concluding business in anticipation of selling at even higher prices in the coming month.\\nNetherlands: Prompt UAN business continues\\nPrompt sales of UAN continue to be made into the Netherlands with prices reported at an even €215/mt FCA.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Next Abu Qir UAN-32 tender likely for June\\nAbu Qir has not yet issued another export tender. The supplier is thought to be waiting until sufficient tonnes are accumulated and for export licenses covering the month of June.\\nAS\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: AS business slow due to credit difficulties\\nBrazilian demand for AS is steadily increasing although recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being.\\nLatest production estimates for the country\\'s corn crop continue to rise due to favourable weather, adding further to corn inventories and lower prices. With the cost of inputs continuing to rise and domestic corn prices hitting six months lows (according to the IGC), the next season\\'s planted area is likely to decline possibly impacting future AS consumption. Concerns over Brazilian farmers\\' access to credit at preferential interest-rates was also a common theme at the annual IFA conference held in Istanbul this week.\\nCaprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160-170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: TCCC may issue another AS tender soon\\nTCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR.\\nAN\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Marketers indicate forward availability of AN\\nMarketers of ammonium nitrate have been approaching Turkish importers this week with indications of availablility as far forward as November and December at prices around $230/mt CFR with 180 days credit, duty paid.\\nBuyers have been counter-indicating some $15/mt lower, but purchasing interest in the positions is evident. The $222.50/mt CFR average of the bids and offers would suggest a $209/mt CFR value for dutiable Russian or Ukranian tonnage, inclusive of credit, for a 205/mt CFR cash equivalent or about $185-190/mt FOB from the Black Sea, depending on cargo size and discharge port.\\nCAN\\nEUROPE\\nGermany: Yara posts new season CAN price\\nYara notified its clients May 26 that the price for CAN in Germany effective June 1 onwards has been fixed at €225/mt CIF inland ports. The posting was down by €50/mt on the previous season price posted at €275/mt CIF, and was also down by €3/mt on the €228/mt CIF price published June 10, 2014, applicable for deliveries from mid-July 2014.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Values edged up to €196-197/mt FCA although sellers failed to secure deals at €198/mt FCA. Business is expected to be slow over the coming month.\\nGrodnoAzot’s June 12 UAN-32 for 25,000 mt is expected to provide indications on forward price direction.\\nUS buyers were rewarded for their patience over the last couple of months, with purchases for the East Coast as low as $220/mt CFR and to New Orleans at $222/mt CFR from Russia.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nThe AS market is extremely quiet with TCCC’s purchase of 10,000 mt caprolactam grade product from a trader, likely Quantum in the low $150s/mt CFR the notable fixture. Chinese netbacks are suggested in the low $130s/mt FOB basis freight, costs and a small margin to the trader.\\nBrazilian buyers continue to enquire after AS with reported offers at $170/mt CFR from suppliers proving unattractive.\\nUS endusers in the South are paying more for AS as demand for rice peaks.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nEvidently satisfied with sales against the May 18 summer-posting, Yara lifted prices for AN and CAN in France June 10 with immediate effect. The AN price was raised to €292/mt CPT and the CAN was posted at €237/mt CPT.\\nThere was also some more interest evident in FSU AN with Moroccan buyers paying up to $210-212/mt FOB equivalent for small parcels to load in June. Mainstream buying interest remains closer to $200-205/mt FOB, but the average netbacks for the week have been raised to reflect the North African deals.\\nThe battle relating to cutbacks in Ukranian availabilty via Group DF closures of output at Cherkassy and RivneAzot continues amidst suggestion of attempted nationalization of the units by the Ukrainan government. A Group DF spokesperson did however reiterate this week that the Group remains in control, and even suggested a possible restart at Cherkassy in July.\\nOffers for Iranian AN are meanwhile reappearing in key markets, including Turkey, and recent shipping enquiries include a cargo of 12-15,000 mt AN in big-bags to load from Bandar Abbas to Vizag in India at the end of June.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Import prices pull down barge offers\\nOffers of UAN-32 barges are cited a couple of dollars either side of $210/st FOB New Orleans this week, due in part to aggressive import offers.\\nHowever, suppliers have been disappointed with orders for the secondary application market in the US interior so far. Inland distributors are buying, but concerns that forward prices will decline have made them more conservative with regard to volumes.\\nMeanwhile, EuroChem will discharge about 30,000 mt of UAN-32 at New Orleans in 2H July. The price tag is around $222/mt CFR, with two buyers believed to be splitting the cargo. PotashCorp is reported to be offering spot barges from its plant at Geismar Louisiana plant around $210/st FOB.\\nUS Midwest: Fill numbers create more drag on prices\\nMore UAN fill pricing is emerging for summer delivery in the US Midwest, which likely will drag down price indications for remaining prompt business in coming days and weeks. Rentech is offering as low as $7.66/unit FOB ($245/st) from its plant at East Dubuque Illinois for orders of at least 5,000 st.\\nThe UAN is not available before July 15, outside of the prompt window. Nevertheless, many traders believe the price will begin to influence endusers seeking prompt UAN for the tail end of the region\\'s top-dress season.\\nIn the meantime, distributors still were posting $9.22-9.63/unit FOB for nearby purchases.\\nUS Atlantic: Vessel prices down on EuroChem sales\\nTwo UAN-32 cargos each discharging at two ports on the Atlantic Coast have been sold by EuroChem to multiple buyers.\\nThe first vessel arriving at the end of this month was sold at $220/mt CFR, the second will arrive in the first half of July and was sold at $235/mt CFR. Both cargos are believed to be about 30,000 mt.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot to close UAN tender June 12\\nGrodnoAzot will close a tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32 June 12.\\nFew sales have been concluded in the UAN market this past week, consequently prices in the tender are expected to provide indications on forward price direction.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Rouen values edge up a little bit\\nValues for UAN-32 in Rouen edged up to €196-197/mt FCA although attempts to sell at €198/mt FCA were swiftly rebuffed.\\nSales have been slow over the past week and are expected to remain so over the coming month with much demand already covered.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S Plains: Demand for AS jumping for rice market\\nDemand for ammonium sulphate is jumping, primarily for the rice markets in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, but also in states along the lower Mississippi River and for some other crops.\\nThe price range from river terminals and inland warehouses has moved up to $290-300/st FOB, with some postings as high as $310/st FOB. The most common quotes are about $12.50/st above postings seen in prior weeks.\\nUS: April imports do nothing to help shortfall\\nApril imports of ammonium sulphate did nothing to alleviate the shortfall of that product that has been apparent since the start of the New Year, although year-over-year imports are higher. The shortage is blamed on domestic production problems, mostly centered on Honeywell\\'s Hopewell Virginia facility, although the company has yet to confirm the extent of interruptions.\\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, April imports of AS were 50,959 st (46,230 mt), slightly below the April 2014 volume of 55,492 st (50,342 mt). As has been the case for much of the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, key suppliers for the most recent month were China at 29,450 st and Canada at 20,687 st.\\nDuring July-April US AS imports were 429,106 st (389,282 mt), up from 338,290 st (306,895 mt). Key AS suppliers during the current US fertilizer year so far have been China at 217,835 st and Canada at 208,416 st.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Offtake of Chinese AS continues to climb\\nTurkish ammonium sulphate (AS) imports climbed 28.4% in April 2015 to 94,718 mt for steel and caprolactam AS grades, boosted by increased offtake of Chinese product.\\nImports from China reached 47,720 mt for that month, an increase of 28% y-o-y. Offtake of Belarusian product also recovered at 26,189 mt, up over 500% y-o-y but more or less in line with volumes recorded in April 2013.\\nTotal volumes imported in January-April stood at 361,102 mt, up 40% on 2014, once again largely supplemented by Chinese product. Imports from China for that period ran to 238,967 mt, up 433% on the same period in 2014.\\nChinese caprolactam AS is growing in popularity in markets such as Turkey and Brazil given that is competitively priced and generally of good quality. Steel grade AS from China has also been secured by Turkish importers although Black Sea product is still sought after due to significant quality issues with recent arrivals from China.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: TCCC buys 10,000 mt caprolactam grade AS\\nTCCC has secured 10,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for early July shipment reported in the low $150s/mt CFR from a trader, reportedly Quantum. Chinese netbacks are suggested in the low $130s/mt FOB basis freight, costs and a small margin to the trader.\\nAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: AN imports pace prior year, exports ahead\\nAmmonium nitrate imports in April were just 31,926 st (28,990 mt), down sharply from 70,403 st (63,869 mt) one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. The April decline was not a major issue to the overall US import rate for the first 10 months of the fertilizer year through April, as the current year outpaced the prior period\\'s 485,102 st (440,082 mt) to 471,116 st (427,394 mt).\\nAlmost all of the April imports - 31,514 st - arrived from Canada. The difference between the prior year’s arrivals and the most recent month was seen in the absence of key suppliers Georgia and the Netherlands from the import line up. One year earlier those countries supplied 27,370 st and 16,521 st respectively.\\nUS AN exports through April closely parallel the current year’s imports, but are moderately ahead of the prior fertilizer year. April shipments out of the US were 35,606 st (32,301 mt), slightly lower than the 38,950 st exported one year earlier. April 2015 exports followed the traditional pattern with almost all US AN loaded for Canada and Mexico at 27,229 st and 8,377 st respectively.\\nAN exports during July-April were 410,926 st (372,790 mt), up nearly 12% from the prior year period total of 367,361 st (333,268 mt). There has been no significant shift in export customers for US AN, although Guatemala bought 23,800 st of AN from the US in the first 10 months of the fertilizer year, up from 8,093 st during the prior year period. More traditional large buyers of US AN during July-April were Canada at 241,321 st and Mexico at 88,201 st.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Yara posts AN and CAN higher\\nYara posted AN and CAN in France higher June 10 with immediate effect. The producer lifted the quote for AN 33.5% N by €7/mt to €292/mt CPT from its May 18 announcement. CAN 27% N was posted at €237/mt CPT.\\nTurkey: AN imports through April down 61.3%\\nTurkish imports of ammonium nitrate (AN) through April at 106,300 mt as identified by customs via GTIS were off by 61.3% on January-April 2014.\\nThis is despite April imports of 18,400 mt which were up by 63% on the prior year. April imports from Russia of 12,200 mt were up from 100 mt in April 2014 while arrivals from Egypt of 2,200 mt were down by 51.7%.\\nJanuary-April arrivals from Russia of 41,000 mt were down by 66% and deliveries from Georgia of 26,700 mt were off by 31%.

It is expected to achieve returns above $180/mt FOB following 36,000 mt sales to Helm and Koch at the end of April priced just below that marker.\\nGrodnoAzot reportedly managed to achieve $170/mt FOB in its 25,000 mt June 12 export tender. Some tonnage is suggested destined for France while the balance will be loaded to nearby markets from the plant by rail.\\nUS movement of UAN continues to disappoint, but the culprit still is wet weather. Assuming conditions improve again before the corn grows too tall, UAN applications still could meet expectations, but summer fill orders likely will be delayed while retailers and distributors are uncertain about their carryover volumes.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nAt least 36,000 mt caprolactam grade AS has been sold by Chinese suppliers to Koch and Trammo with some small container business to Ameropa this week. The Koch tonnage will likely be directed to Indonesia against previous sales to Gresik.\\nPetrokimia Gresik is seeking further product and has issued a tender closing June 22 for 10-15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival.\\nIn the Black Sea steel grade AS values have declined at least $5/mt on a reported 4,000 mt purchase by Mekatrade. Turkey has been suggested as the cargo destination.\\nEurochem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, possibly to Gubretas in combination with 25,000 mt DAP. No further details are known. Turkish caprolactam grade AS prices are pegged in the high $160s/mt CFR duty paid.\\nEuropean caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nFSU suppliers continue to aim for higher netbacks from key markets such as Brazil and Turkey, but sales around an even $210/mt FOB and marginally higher are so far limited to smaller parcels for North Africa.\\nSuggestions that Brazilian buyers had concluded parcles of AN in combination with phosphates and urea at prices providing suppliers with netbacks above $215/mt FOB for AN could not be verified.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports\\nUAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.\\nMeanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans..\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market\\nAs expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.\\nThe new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot sells 25,000 mt UAN-32\\nContrary to earlier reports, GrodnoAzot said it sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 following its June 12 export tender. The product to load onto vessels was reported secured at $170/mt FOB, destined for France while tonnage destined for Ukraine will be loaded from the plant by rail.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Values stable on small number of sales\\nSales into France continue to be slow around the €196-197/mt FCA marker. Some traders continue to push for €200/mt FCA but so far this has not been successful.\\nDemand from farmers is expected to decrease over the next few weeks as their focus is shifted to harvesting the winter wheat crop. A lack of rainfall is causing some concern, with wheat and rapeseed yields in the central part of the country down 10-15% from last year’s high level with the potential to decrease further if rain does not fall over the coming weeks.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir issues 10,000 mt UAN tender\\nAbu Qir issued an export tender closing June 23 for 10,000 mt UAN-32 for prompt loading.\\nHelm and Koch secured a total of 36,000 mt from the supplier at the end of April, priced just below $180/mt FOB.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: More Chinese AS booked for US Gulf\\nA panamax of granular ammonium sulphate plus other products is loading this month from China for Gavilon. Specific volume breakdowns were not clear at press time, but in addition to AS, the vessel is carrying industrial grade AS and phosacid carried in drums.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Number of caprolactam grade AS deals fixed\\nEuropean caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.\\nGranular AS prices are pegged at $235/mt CFR.\\nThe latest ANDA data reveals January-May imports of both grades AS grew 15% to 845,731 mt.

Vessels carrying cargo purchased some weeks ago were delayed and meant some distributors secured additional prompt tonnes at €228-230/mt FCA to meet ongoing demand from farmers. Despite failing to lift prices further, suppliers will have pleased by the euro trading marginally above $1.10 March 26, up from about $1.06 March 19.\\nScarcely any other UAN trade was noted as buyers remain reluctant to secure additional tonnage that may well be delivered after the key application seasons. Grodno scrapped its 25,000 mt UAN for March/April shipment on March 24 after receiving bids well below $220mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, some $30/mt lower than it had anticipated, while Abu Qir failed to sell 27,500 mt UAN-32 which it tendered March 25. The supplier is now reported to be offering the cargo to traders via negotiations.\\nIn the US barge UAN-32 values at New Orleans are steady to slightly lower, but this is mostly because suppliers and endusers are $5-20/st apart on pricing full tows for movement to the Midwest. The recent plunge in US urea pricing should put pressure on UAN sellers, but they likely will wait for more substantial demand before giving ground on their prices.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nLimited activity has been noted across the AS market this week with Chinese suppliers still offering caprolactam grade product at $128- 130/mt FOB. Steel grade is offered nearer $122-123/mt FOB.\\nNITRATES AND SULPHATE | 2\\nGrodno’s 25,000 mt AS export tender for March-April shipment that closed March 24 failed to yield much interest with bids for small quantities reported submitted from neighbouring countries in the mid $130/mt FOB.\\nBlack Sea AS prices remain stagnant with small volumes of steel grade still trading in the low $130s/mt FOB. Caprolactam grade product is still assessed in the low $150s/mt FOB although a lack of product availability means little if any product has been sold lately.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nAs had been predicted, AN and CAN values continue to slide outside Europe, and there is no end in sight in the short term for material loading from the FSU to highly competitive markets such as Brazil and Turkey. Rapidly sliding urea prices and heavy inventories from prior imports are set to continue to excert downward pressure on the two grades.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nUAN\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nUS CALIFORNIA\\nUAN cargo from China headed for California\\nTrammo is expected to discharge 27,500 mt of UAN-32 in California during April. The cargo likely has been resold to other buyers, however neither the CFR California nor FOB China price was available at press time. Rail delivered UAN in California is indicated at $9.70/unit FOB on a short ton basis.\\nUS MIDWEST\\nUS Midwest storage filled, sellers waiting for demand\\nUAN suppliers have met most of their shipment obligations to Midwest distributors and retailers, leaving tanks on both sides of the Mississippi River filled until demand emerges. Most of that demand will have to wait until corn is planted and emerging. Distributors report they are reluctant to commit to forward barge loads or unit trains in anticipation of later demand. This is not because they have any doubts that further volumes will be needed, but because they are convinced prices will soften due to competition from progressivly cheaper granular urea. For now, quotes of UAN to retailers\\nremain around $10/unit FOB.\\nUS NOLA\\nIndications shaky for UAN barges\\nReports of demand and price indications vary substantially this week\\nNITRATES AND SULPHATE | 3\\nfor UAN-32 barges. While some suppliers saw no demand available above $255/st FOB New Orleans, others cited sales around $257- 262/st FOB.\\nFor now most suppliers are holding out above the lowest bids, and more serious interest is hoped for in coming days and weeks now that the upper Mississippi River is open through to the Twin Cities in Minnesota. However, inland distributors are more likely to turn to truck suppliers in the near term for resupply.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBALTIC SEA\\nGrodno scraps UAN tender\\nReports suggest Grodno scrapped its 25,000 mt UAN for March/April shipment on March 24 after receiving bids well below $220mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent, some $30/mt lower than the target set ahead of the session.\\nEUROPE\\nFRANCE\\nOngoing optimism in French UAN market\\nA number of French UAN suppliers reported empty tanks this week and were eagerly anticipating the arrival of vessels carrying cargo purchased some weeks ago. Some suppliers keen to meet ongoing demand from farmers secured additional prompt tonnes at €228- 230/mt FCA. Sellers are still keen to push prices up further but will have been cheered by the euro trading marginally above $1.10 March 26, up from about $1.06 March 19.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEGYPT\\nLatest Abu Qir tender fails to trigger bids\\nNo bids were received in the Abu Qir sales tender for 27,500 mt UAN-32 which closed March 25. Traders had suggested it might be difficult to sell the cargo in Europe given that the tonnes might arrive too late for the current application season.\\nThe supplier is now reported to be offering the cargo to traders via negotiations.\\nThe producer last sold a 25,000 mt UAN-32 parcel February 17 at\\n$239.50/mt FOB, down $11.50/mt FOB on its previous sale under its February 12 tender.\\nAN\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nBRAZIL\\nImporters unwilling to commit to more\\nAN\\nBrazilian importers of AN continue to hold off on additional purchases, citing excessive premiums for nitrate nitrogen versus N content in urea. Offers for granular urea down to $285/mt CFR reflect a $6.20/unit N value while offers for AN around $275/mt CFR\\nare indicative of $8.10/unit N for nitrate premiums still in excess of 30%.\\nFSU sellers that did adjust offers to the $275/mt CFR number in recent weeks are yet to concede further substantial discounts, but these seem inevitable for the sellers to secure additional business unless urea prices were to rebound substantially. Interest indicated from buyers is closer to $250/mt CFR.\\nNITRATES AND SULPHATE | 4\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nEUROPE\\nTURKEY\\nDomestic AN and CAN prices in Turkey lower\\nMost recent quotes for AN from the domestic Turkish industry and from Turkish importers with existing inventories of AN are around TRY 855/mt FCA in bags.\\nThe Turkish currency traded today at TRY 2.60 against the US dollar. Deducting VAT at 18%, handling/bagging/transport at a $17/mt equivalent, and adjusting for 6.5% import duty, the offers reflect a value for imported material around $245/mt CIF, or about $225/mt FOB from the Black Sea with no provisions for margins for the sellers.\\nOffers for CAN are posted at TRY 725/mt FCA. Applying the same cost factors on Ukrainian CAN which is exempt from the 6.5% duty, the calculation projects a delivered value of about $220/mt CIF, or around $200/mt FOB Black Sea.\\nThis environment is obviously not conducive for additional imports based on quotes for AN from the Black Sea around an even $250/mt FOB and quotes at similar numbers for CAN.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nAS\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nBRAZIL\\nChinese AN exports decline\\nExports of ammonium nitrate from China in February identified by customs via GTIS close to 22,000 mt were down by 45.6% on February 2014.\\nCumulative January-February exports of 62,000 mt were down by 25% from the same months in 2014.

Midwest and Southern Plains prices were flat.\\nFar more importantly, distributors also reported substantial sales from retail outlets, especially in the Southern Plains region. That region is where the next wave of US enduser demand for urea will appear, as farmers top-dress emerging winter wheat. The level of demand for urea and some other nitrogen products for this crop already is sparking talk of a reversal in the global urea market. The US has added about 130,000 mt of granular urea spot purchases to arrive by early April in the last couple of weeks. While the volume is a spit in the ocean on the global scale, the trend may force endusers in other countries to return to the market in short order to ensure needed volumes.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nUS NOLA: Thin trading, wide price spread\\nBy the end of the week\\'s trading, prompt granular urea barges had changed hands at $187-204/st FOB New Orleans, but with the market trending higher on amost each transaction.\\nNew Orleans values jumped starting February 2 after CF went shopping for prompt barges. The producer paid $198/st FOB New Orleans or more for two-four barges, but stepped away from the market when offers rose to $200/st FOB.\\nMultiple sales were confirmed as low as $187/st FOB February 1, but most prompt business appears to have occurred around $195-200/st FOB.\\nBids for 2H February started the week at $194/st FOB, but forward business has been booked up to $208/st FOB.\\nImport lineup\\nMeanwhile, a 40-45,000 mt cargo of granular urea and a 30-35,000 mt cargo of granular urea have been booked for March arrival in the US. The urea was bought at $195-200/mt FOB Middle East. The smaller of the two cargos is believed to belong to Keytrade, and will arrive in early March, thanks to taking the short route through the Suez canal. The larger cargo has been linked to just about every importer to the US market, but confirmation of ownership could not be secured at press time.\\nPreviously Koch was confirmed as owning a spot Chinese panamax due into New Orleans at the end of March, while Dreymoor will bring a PIC 40,000 mt contract cargo to the US Gulf next month.\\nUS S. Plains: Sales may support higher prices\\nSome distributors along the Arkansas River who have sold most of their granular urea at $240/st FOB in recent days, believe demand is sufficient to move back up to $245/st FOB.\\nMany sellers in the region report a steady stream of retail demand, almost all of which appears to have been sold to meet prior sales to farmers. This means a great deal of retailer space remains to be filled before the top-dress run on winter wheat gets underway in force.\\nUS Midwest: Prices hold for remaining urea\\nGranular urea bins at the distributor and retail level across the Midwest are exhausted in many\\ncases. Increasingly quotes to retailers are not based on prompt pick up, but on when warehouses can be restocked by barge when the upper Mississippi River system reopens for the spring.\\nThis situation is why prompt offers for the remaining granular urea as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota are holding at $260/st FOB, while river-open prices for the same point are closer to $250/st FOB. The lowest prompt price tag in the Midwest region remains $235/st FOB around St. Louis, Missouri, which still is accessible by barge.\\nCanada: Coop Federee purchase suggested\\nCanadian importer Coop Federee is reported to have booked a cargo of 20-25,000 mt granular urea with a trader supplying from the Baltic in February or early March at $212/mt CFR basis one-port discharge.\\nEvidently convinced that the market for granular urea may have reached a floor, the importer is suggested to be seeking an additional cargo for March loading.\\nMexico: Group testing prices February 4\\nThe Mexican Group of Importers is evaluating offers for 25,000 mt prilled or granular urea February 4. The enquiry called for offers to be submitted for the quantity to load in February/early March for discharge at three East Coast Mexico ports.\\nOther importers are also contemplating purchases, and will be following the Group tender closely for price guidance.\\nMexican imports of urea from January through November were meanwhile assessed by customs at 1.43 million mt, down by 0.5% on the same period in 2014.\\nImports from China were down by 5.9% to 756,000 mt and Russia was off by 1.2% to 484,000 mt. Arrivals from the UAE were up from zero to 52,000 mt while Ukraine was down by 52% to 43,400 mt.\\nNovember imports were off sharply from 149,000 in 2014 to 19,000 mt in 2015. Russia accounted for 18,200 mt of the November 2015 volume while arrivals from China were down from 127,000 mt in 2014 to 140 mt in 2015.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nUS Atlantic Coast: Import competition drives UAN lower\\nUAN truck prices along the US East Coast have fallen as low as $5.31/unit FOB in the Chesapeake region. Prices are still posted up to $5.94/unit FOB from terminals further south.\\nThe driver for the current decline appears to be the willingness of sellers of UAN from EuroChem, Acron and possibly other suppliers to compete hard for business in order to clear tank space for further imports. Postings along the Atlantic seaboard were over $6.72/unit FOB in prior weeks.\\nImport market\\nAs a result of this competition, indications for spot UAN Cargos to the US East Coast have declined $5/mt from the prior week to $170-175/mt CFR. Some importers argue they can buy below this level but no completed business has been confimed in the $160s/mt CFR so far.\\nUS NOLA: UAN quotes holding firm\\nMore and more traders are confirming that despite lower bids and offers in the paper markets, prompt UAN- 32 barges are not available below $160/st FOB New Orleans.\\nMuch of the more bearish talk in the marketplace has been fueled by the rumor that CF is supporting a cargo sale through a trader to Argentina that would net no better than $130-140/mt FOB US Gulf. However, domestic physical offers and barge offers from UAN importers have not reached near these levels.\\nUS Midwest: Modest shift in UAN quotes\\nUS UAN indications arguably are up marginally this week. However, the difference from earlier reports is very modest and reflects higher costs from some inland terminals rather than improved enduser support. The current Midwest price spread is $6.94-7.00/unit FOB.\\nAS\\nUS S. Plains: AS values hold after prior plunge\\nAfter the sharp decline in ammonium sulphate postings in the south at the end of January, distributors have held steady at $220-230/st FOB in the last couple of weeks. Seasonal demand will not emerge for another few weeks, and peak AS use in the south usually coincides with the first urea application on the rice crop, when the two products are blended.\\nMexico: Jump in AS imports from Belgium\\nMexican AS imports for November 2015 were just 23 mt, a decrease of 100% on the same period in 2014.\\nTotal imports for the January-November 2015 period registered 213,982 mt, down 20% year-on-year. Mexican imports from Belgium for the first 11 months of this year grew significantly reaching 144,069 mt, up on the mere 17,000 mt recorded for 2014.\\nOff-take from Belarus was 16,886 mt, up 62%. Due to Mexican sanctions on AS originating from China and US, imports from these countries have slumped. Off-take from China reached just 6,500 mt for January- November 2015, a 96% decline on the prior year, while imports from the US were just 416 mt, down 99% year-on-year.\\nAMMONIA\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nUS Midwest: Some suppliers offer cheaper ammonia\\nNot all suppliers are matching up, but prompt ammonia offers are more aggressive from some US producers and traders this week. Midwest retailers are finding offers from river and pipeline terminals at $430/st FOB this week, down $20/st from prior indications.\\nThere are rumors of sales at even lower levels, based on trucked ammonia from plants farther afield, but there also are postings remaining at $450/st FOB from some sellers.\\nUS NOLA: Barge indications narrow\\nInland ammonia resale values dropped this week, which cut into the potential return available for ammonia barges in the US Gulf and leaving the current week\\'s range at $301-330/st FOB New Orleans.\\nThe decline in the average price was only $10/st over the last week. However, that drop was the result of $20/st being subtracted entirely from the top end of last week\\'s range of $301-350/st FOB.\\nUS Tampa: Mosaic cut hits demand\\nA rough estimate of lost US Gulf ammonia demand during Q1 is 73,000 mt, assuming Mosaic cuts finished phosphate production by the maximum indicated figure of 400,000 mt. However, the likely figure is more difficult to estimate compared to prior years as the company has not provided more details of the likely reduction betweek DAP, MAP and its MicroEssentials line. All tnese products consume various amounts of nitrogen and the company does not provide precise details on its MicroEssentials output.\\nUS S. Plains: More aggressive offers\\nProducers are backing lower prices for ammonia to ship on a prompt and forward basis in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas and elsewhere. Prices have declined an average of $22/st from late January to $315-330/st FOB, according to distributors in the region.\\nOrders for ammonia are coming in based on these offers, with deliveries likely to be spread from coming weeks into March for use as pre-plant applications on corn acres.\\nUS Northern Plains: Ammonia slightly lower\\nThere no consistent reports out of the Dakotas regarding ammonia values, with some suppliers suggesting price cuts in the region are not as aggressive as seen in other regions. Sellers would only admit to about a $10/st decline from prior weeks to $490/st FOB. However, there remains time for buyers to push for cuts that more closely reflect ammonia costs seen in other US markets.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nMosaic cuts output, DAP still losing ground\\nMosaic announced its long expected production curtailment this week, saying it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished phosphate production during Q1. However, it would be a substantial exaggeration to suggest the market has reacted to this move.\\nThe US New Orleans DAP benchmark inched slightly higher this week, but most inland postings moved down in key regions. This indicates that the domestic DAP/MAP supply chain remains well stocked and that\\ndistributors and retailers are more concerned with disposing of existing supplies and spring orders than in adding more volume.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nUS NOLA: DAP steady after Mosaic confirms cut\\nAt the start of the week the bid offer spread for prompt DAP barges was reported at $310-315/st FOB New Orleans. By February 4 completed business was reported at $313-326/st FOB New Orleans by traders, as bullish buying overtook bearish sentiments expressed by many traders. In addition, Mosaic claimed a single DAP barge sale at $335/st FOB, creating a $22/st spread for the week.\\nOn average, this week\\'s DAP New Orleans price range is $1.50/st higher than the prior week.\\nMeanwhile, two more PhosAgro 30-35,000 mt cargos are planned for the US, both believed destined for United Suppliers. EuroChem also is in the freight market to load 50,000 mt of MAP for the US. These vessels are expected to arrive by the end of March.\\nUS Tampa: No new exports again\\nMosaic is not reporting any new export sales over the past week. Its February 3 announcement of a Q1 production cut indicated it would not participate in recent low indications cited in Brazil\\'s market. Even earlier returns possible from Brazil and other markets in South America suggest a decline in the US export indication to $350-360/mt FOB Tampa.\\nThis week\\'s drop indicates a decline of $20/mt from the prior week at both ends of the range. The move down puts the export price tag roughly in line with bids for March physical positions in the New Orleans barge market.\\nUS S. Plains: DAP quotes lower due to lack of interest\\nDAP is not moving from warehouses in the southern US east or west of the Mississippi River yet, but distributors have been tempted to lower posted prices in hopes of attracting demand. At press time, quotes for DAP from warehouses along the Arkansas River were at $355/st, while inland locations south of Mason- Dixon typically were $360/st FOB. The low end of this range is $15/st below last week\\'s postings.\\nUS Midwest: Modest demand yields lower prices\\nModest phosphate sales volumes are typical in winter, but Midwest distributors have been willing to reflect lower replacement costs for DAP and MAP in recent weeks by cutting resale prices to retailers.\\nOver the last week, sales prices have slipped about $10/st to as low as $360/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River.\\nUSA: Mosaic finally announces phosphate cuts\\nMosaic finally came through with its expected market related production cut announcement February 3. It said it intends to reduce output during Q1 by up to 400,000 mt DAP/MAP using rotating plant shutdowns.\\nMosaic insists that current market prices do not reflect the value of its phosphate products. The company is not selling at the low price seen in Brazil in recent days or at the low end of the recent price range in the New Orleans barge market.\\nSome traders were disappointed that the company hedged its plans by not committing to the full 400,000 mt of cuts, and instead said only that it would reduce by up to that volume.\\nNevertheless, the timing of the announcement probably is at the best time for the US phosphate giant, with only about 45 days left before the reopening of the upper Mississippi River system and up to 60 days before field work for most spring planting will be underway. While some further cargos from Morocco and possibly the FSU are expected to arrive in coming weeks, traders probably will not be able to add spot cargos from China to the US import lineup.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP/TSP exports drop 19% in 2015\\nMexico exported 620,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP between January and November against 762,000 mt in the same period in 2014, representing a 19% reduction, according to GTIS.\\nMAP exports reached 263,000 mt during the period with 105,000 mt to Australia, 76,000 mt to Chile and 58,000 mt to Argentina. DAP exports reached 138,000 mt during the period with 41,000 mt to Argentina, 36,000 mt to Chile, 20,000 mt to Australia and 26,000 mt to Cuba and Ecuador combined.\\nTSP exports reached 219,000 mt including 93,000 mt to Chile, 90,000 mt to Argentina, 17,000 mt to the US and 16,000 mt to Brazil.\\nIn December, Fertinal is believed to have exported 70,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP, bringing its full year DAP/MAP/TSP exports to almost 700,000 mt, which would be a fall of 13% against the full year 2014.\\nMexico: DAP/MAP prices fall in new deal\\nFertinal has finalised a 45,000 mt mixed MAP and MAP plus zinc cargo to Australia set for loading in 8-12 days. The shipment is priced on a formula.\\nThe company continues to negotiate one 40,000 mt mixed DAP/MAP/TSP cargo to Chile which is likely to load in early March.\\nFertinal\\'s current DAP/MAP price levels are quoted at 370/mt FOB as the company benefits from higher prices in the Australian buying season and as it avoids sales to the low priced Brazilian market.\\nPOTASH\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nUS NOLA: Barge offers drift lower\\nImported potash barges continue to inch lower as some importers continue to accept lower bids in order to reduce their positions ahead of the expected reopening of the upper Mississippi River system in mid-late March. The bottom of this week\\'s range was cited at $205/st FOB, although some suppliers are holding out for at least $210/st FOB.\\nUS Midwest: Some truck sales at latest postings\\nNew granular potash sales from distributors to retailers are sparse, but reports from the Midwest suggest the $260/st FOB price tag sought by some Canadian suppliers has been accepted in the market. So far only about a $5/st discount is indicated for some, but not all, offshore material.\\nMexico: November MOP imports down 72%\\nMexico imported 9,283 mt of MOP in November, a decrease of 72% from the same month in 2014, according to the latest customs data via GTIS.\\nOf this, 6,307 mt was shipped by SQM. This can be compared to November 2014, when the Chilean producer sent 12,756 mt to Mexico. Uralkali and Canpotex each loaded around 1,000 mt in November 2015.\\nThe month’s MOP imports brought Mexico’s January through November total to 243,068 mt – 17% more than in the same period of 2014, despite the decreased November shipments.\\nSQM remained the country’s largest supply partner, having shipped 94,904 during the 11 months of 2015, compared to 70,907 mt the year before. Mexico imported 74,677 mt from Canpotex and 64,895 mt from Uralkali, respective increases of 27% and 10% from 2014.\\nSULPHUR\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nUS Gulf: Mosaic believed to have reduced Q1 supply\\nMosaic is believed to have negotiated lower liquid sulphur volumes for delivery to its US Gulf phosphate operations during Q1, but it is unclear if it has turned away all of the sulphur to cover its announced\\nphosphate production curtailment. This is because Mosaic said it would cut up to 400,000 mt of finished products, rather than providing a specific figure.\\nCorrection: Last week\\'s edition of Fertilizer Week should have posted a US Tampa contract liquid sulphur price tag of $95/lt FOB. The February 28 edition did not correctly update settled Q1 business, and instead posted $110/lt FOB. FW regrets any confusion that ensued.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nMexico: November exports reach 131,421 mt\\nMexico exported 131,421 mt of sulphuric acid in November 2015, up 65% year on year. This brought exports for the first 11 months of the year to 1.17 million mt, 75% higher than the same period in 2014.\\nThe US remained the main destination for Mexican exports, taking 70,970 mt of the November volumes, most if not all of which was likely sourced from Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad smelter.\\nMexico also sent 38,280 mt to Brazil and 21,780 mt to Morocco in November, having sent sulphuric acid to Morocco for the first time on record in September.\\nFor January to November 2015, exports to Chile climbed to 225,054 mt from 39,286 mt in the equivalent period in 2014 and 45,066 mt in 2013, while exports to Brazil were up to 178,966 mt from effectively nothing in 2014 and 2013.\\nThe increases are the result of production at the Boleo mine, which began producing copper January 17, 2015 and has been a key source of marginal acid supply.\\nCRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid in 2015 was around 60-100,000 mt, while it is able to produce around 700,000 mt.\\nIn recent months, length in the Chilean market forced Mexico to divert cargoes from Chile to Brazil and Morocco at exceptionally low or even negative FOB prices.\\nConversely, Mexican imports for the year to November were down 2% at 168,856 mt, with 99,956 mt from South Korea, 46,086 mt from China, 18,755 mt from Japan, and 4,030 from the US. Imports from China are up from effectively nothing in previous years.\\nUS: Spot market quiet on limited demand\\nThe US spot market remained quiet, though sources suggested that contractual volumes continued moving. Some argued that the domestic market was long, limiting import demand. Meanwhile, spot prices were assessed stable in the $40s/mt CFR pending further indications.\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Indeed, it appears the only direction the barge market can go is down from this week’s highest price of $380/st FOB New Orleans. Other prompt sales this week were as low as $346/st FOB, and subsequent offers late June 18 were below that for prompt barges. July offers are around $305/st FOB, and at least one physical barge was sold for delivery in 1H August at $295/st FOB.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nUS Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike\\nEven though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.\\nUS S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise\\nGranular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.\\nUrea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.\\nPredictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.\\nUS NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker\\nPush almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June\\n15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.\\nMost or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.\\nBy the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB. Prilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.\\nChina Oil\\'s pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.\\nThe spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo arriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July. A rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.\\nUS N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values\\nSpot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.\\nLate season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.\\nCanada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use\\nMarket expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from\\nthe US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market\\nAs expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.\\nThe new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.\\nUS NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports\\nUAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.\\nMeanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans.\\nAS\\nUS NOLA: More Chinese AS booked for US Gulf\\nA panamax of granular ammonium sulphate plus other products is loading this month from China for Gavilon. Specific volume breakdowns were not clear at press time, but in addition to AS, the vessel is carrying industrial grade AS and phosacid carried in drums.\\nAMMONIA\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers $50-60/st below cash market\\nDistributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.\\nUS NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down\\nPossible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.\\nFor now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.\\nTampa: July pricing focus of market\\'s attention\\nMosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nUS DAP enters long, uninterested summer\\nDAP indications are relatively flat over the last two weeks. Barring an unlikely jump in demand for prompt barges the marketplace appears willing to go forward without substantial guidance with regard to fill pricing. Current US spot barge pricing around $420/st FOB still does not support imports from China or Morocco (although Russian producers appear to be wiling to ship modest volumes to the US). Fill offers from Mosaic and at least one importer as high as $440/st FOB New Orleans or the equivalent inland did not excite interest, although the producer is willing to sell prompt barges at $425/st FOB. For now Mosaic seems likely to focus on refilling its consignment warehouse space, and look to the forward market to help it price US DAP.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nUS: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady\\nUS DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nMay 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.\\nUS NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP\\nPrompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.\\nUS Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market\\nMosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.\\nMarkets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.\\nUS Midwest: Little movement expected ahead\\nDistributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.\\nUS S Plains: Wet weather puts end to phosphate use\\nSoybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.\\nNevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.\\nMexico: Fertinal committed through to September\\nDeliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.\\nFertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.\\nFor July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July\\'s production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.\\nAn estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.\\nProduction levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.\\nThe increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.\\nPrice levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nUS: Phosacid exports got boost in May\\nUS phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of\\nthe current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nThe jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.\\nThe main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.\\nPOTASH\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nUS Midwest: Only marginal demand remains\\nSome potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.\\nUS NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat\\nThere are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.\\nSULPHUR\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nCanada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher\\nPrices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.\\nHowever, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Truckloads were a whopping $32/st more expensive in the Midwest where anecdotal reports suggest more warehouses are empty than carrying product. In the Southern Plains values were down $7/st from the prior week. Distributors here appear to have sufficient urea in the pipeline now to meet demand for rice, although much of it still is being trucked from the US Gulf and even the east side of the Mississippi River.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nUS Midwest: Late demand holding prices up\\nGranular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.\\nNevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.\\nUS S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks\\nEven though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week\\'s market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.\\nTravel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.\\nUS NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected\\nBy the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week\\'s close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.\\nAt the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.\\nFor months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.\\nMarket rumours regarding the start-up of CF\\'s urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.\\nUS N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets\\nForward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.\\nIt is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.\\nCanada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports\\nA 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.\\nMarket sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers succeeded\\nCF Industries\\' fill offers for UAN brought buyers across the region to the table to commit material generally expected to ship mostly during Q3. Suppliers are expected to seek higher prices in Q4, but for now indications across the region likely will hold at $7.56-7.81/unit FOB.\\nOverall, CF\\'s price list was more aggressive than many expected. However, it was roughly in line with indications released by small suppliers earlier in June. Aggressive pricing from all suppliers likely was needed for this year\\'s fill as anecdotal reports suggest carryover UAN is greater than nomal, especially west of the Mississippi River.\\nAS\\nUS S Plains: AS holding value as seasonal demand ends\\nDespite the somewhat disappointing reports regarding demand from the rice market this year due to adverse weather, seasonal demand for ammonium sulphate was sufficient to enable distributors to end June with minimal carryover.\\nQuotes for truckloads along the Arkansas River are $290-295/st FOB. This is just $5/st off the seasonal peak, when first nitrogen applications were moving to rice acres. However, prices in Texas and in parts of Oklahoma are cited $20/st or more below river terminals based on recent fill offers from producers.\\nUS Midwest: Fill indications bring offers down\\nFill offers from Honeywell and other US suppliers are reported at $270-280/st FOB across the region for granular product.\\nThis is a huge drop from the sales values seen at the peak of spring demand, but the season was marked by spot outages and better than expected demand as some retailers and distributors moved away from ammonium nitrate.\\nAMMONIA\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nUS Midwest: Fill prices rule market\\nEven though regional buyers did not express anywhere near as much enthusiasm for fill and pre-pay ammonia, consistent reports to Fertilizer Week this week are that endusers booked as much ammonia as CF and other suppliers were willing to sell. One result is that the prompt market has moved roughly in line with fill offers from CF Industries and others at $550-560/st FOB.\\nCarryover ammonia is reported across the Midwest, due mostly to the uncooperative weather conditions. Despite this retailers generally were eager to make sure they go into the fall season with as much ammonia as they would normally carry. The $50-60/st price cut for the fill sales was more aggressive than many expected, but indicated producers\\' recognized the difficult financial math corn growers faced in the fertilizer year that just ended June 30.\\nUS Gulf: Demand may have downs and ups\\nIt is possible US Gulf demand may see some shifts downward before rebounding in August-September, depending on events outside of the supply chain to US DAP/MAP producers.\\nIn the near term, demand for spot ammonia cargos to help refill the US direct application supply chain could easily be delayed, if reports reguarding lost sales this summer prove correct. Supposedly much of the carryover ammonia remains in the hands of retailers and distributors, which helps explain the fairly aggressive fill and pre-pay prices offered for the summer.\\nLooking farther ahead, marketplace scuttlebutt indicates CF could begin commercial production from its new Donaldsonville, Louisiana urea plant in late September or early October. That plant will rely on imported ammonia through Yara until Q1 or Q2 of next year when a supporting ammonia train will be completed at the CF complex.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nUS DAP gains a little, but not enough for imports\\nThis week’s roundup of phosphate activity echoes last week’s. Barge values moved up a little more as inland values remained flat. US prices remain too low to attract competition from overseas, so far. Some inland distributors are reporting Mosaic will not guarantee new purchases will be delivered before November, but this still should be in time for fall applications. DAP values in the US likely will be firm to higher in the near\\nterm thanks to June 30 US Department of Agriculture reports that finally reflected earlier reports of reduced acres for corn.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nUS: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1\\nThe January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers\\' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.\\nAt the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers\\' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.\\nThe February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers\\' inventory at month\\'s end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014.\\nMarch 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year. Inventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.\\nTotal production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of\\n2% compared with the previous year. US producers\\' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.\\nFebruary shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014. During the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July- March, US producers\\' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.\\nUS NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains\\nIncreases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.\\nThe bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.\\nMAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.\\nUS Midwest: Demand over, fill next concern\\nWith seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.\\nHowever, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer\\'s expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture\\'s forecasts will have to hold.\\nUS Tampa: Small sales continue\\nMosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.\\nThe price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.\\nPOTASH\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nUS NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question\\nBPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.\\nThe producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.\\nPreviously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.\\nIn the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.\\nUS Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat\\nThe main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.\\nDemand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The fill programs are offering barge and truck volumes at inland locations for delivery during Q3.\\nThe forward prices are only about $10/st cheaper than the prompt market when netted back to New Orleans, based on current freight. However, the inland summer fill offers are $30-35/st cheaper than prompt pricing.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nUS: Urea poured in during February\\nUS granular urea arrivals surged by more more than 200,000 mt during February compared to one year earlier, pushing July-February arrival totals more than 1.1 million mt over arrivals during the first eight months of the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.\\nFebruary 2015 imports were 868,377 st (787,786 mt), up substantially from 611,160 st (554,441 mt) one year ealier. Traditional suppliers made up most of the arrivals during the most recent month, with almost all of the those countries adding to their February 2014 volume. The largest suppliers to the US in February 2015 all were in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia at 147,576 st, Qatar at 110,060 st and the UAE at 109,953 st. An exception to the trend was Canada, whose February arrivals in the US fell to 58,057 st from 96,566 st--most likely due to domestic demand in Canada.\\nThe February imports brought the first eight months of the US fertilizer year to 5.51 million st (5 million mt), up a whopping 1.26 million st from 4.25 million st (3.86 million mt) during the prior year period.\\nMajor suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Qatar at 1.09 million st, China at 971,778 st (most of which discharged in July-December) and Canada at 600,103 st.\\nExports\\nUS urea exports in February of this year were 11,860 st , (10,759 mt) down from 16,576 st (15,038 mt) one year earlier. In both months most of the tons shipped in very small lots to about a dozen countries. During July-February of the current fertilizer year 149,455 st (135,585 mt) was shipped internationally versus 193,439 st (175,487 mt) during the prior year period. Canada remained the primary destination for US urea, with 120,862 st) loaded for that country.\\nUS New Orleans: Seasonal divide in barge urea values\\nGranular urea barges available on a prompt basis at New Orleans traded as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans this week for barges in the Gulf, while granular urea barges available on up-river tows sold up to $290/st FOB.\\nOverall most trades occured in the low $270s/st FOB, with Chinese and non-Chinese material trading at roughly the same values. The highest price tags were for barges tied up at Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri, which sold as high as $285/st FOB and $290/st FOB respectively basis New Orleans.\\nSummer fill\\nEven though the spring season is far from over for US urea consumption, importers and at least one North American producer are offering granular urea for Q3 delivery. Pricing is on a FOB truck basis from inland terminals and by barge, typically priced on a delivered basis. The indicated values in all cases generally equate to $252-254/st FOB New Orleans, allowing for a modest margin to a trader.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nUS: February UAN imports decline still leaves July- February arrivals in surplus\\nUS UAN imports slowed substantially in February compared to the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. However, the one-month drop still leaves arrivals during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year well ahead of the same period during 2013/2014. The causes for the drop in US arrivals were US importers reducing their bids at a time when other European demand was expected to increase.\\nFebruary imports totaled 337,767 st (306,420 mt) compared to 479,963 st (435,420 mt) one year earlier. The majority of the reduction was seen in shipments from two key US suppliers. February arrivals this year from Trinidad and Tobago fell to 40,228 st from 117,995 st, while imports from Russia fell to 82,906 st versus 163,858 st. Canadian arrivals were up over the relevant months to 45,564 st from 26,947 st.\\nThe February 2015 volume brought the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year\\'s imports to 2.21 million st (2 million mt) versus 1.89 million st (1.72 million mt) for the prior year period. The key traditional suppliers remained the same year over year, with imports from Russia reaching 784,538 st during July- February, followed by Trinidad and Tobago at 502,877 st and Canada at 311,998 st. China, a relative newcomer to the US market, supplied 239,048 st in imports during July-February\\nExports\\nUS UAN exports in February were relatively modest at 51,024 st (46,289 st). The destination for 44,311 st of the total was France. July-February export cargos were 263,882 st (239,392 mt). France at 145,471 st and Argentina at 41,868 st were the primary destinations for US UAN, with CF Industries believed to have suppiled all the US exported UAN.\\nUS Midwest: UAN deliveries starting to stack up ahead of season\\nLogistics ahead of seasonal demand for UAN already has applied some downward pressure on UAN in the Midwest. Distributors report efforts to find storage space for UAN have forced them to offer more aggressive prices rather than rack up substantial demurrage bills for tank cars. The impact has not been felt in the truck markets, as the difficulty is in finding homes for multiple railcars or even barge volumes. As a result, postings to retailers remain around $10/unit FOB across much of the region.\\nAS\\nUS: AS imports up, exports down\\nHigher ammonium sulphate imports in the first eight months of the current fertilizer year and lower exports reflect anecdotal reports in recent months about the tight supply of AS due to greater demand.\\nHowever, despite the overal gain in imports during July-February, February 2015 arrivals in the US were down from February 2014 at 45,318 st (41,112 mt) versus 65,186 st (59,136 mt), according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. Canada and China supplied almost all the imported AS in February, at 29,488 st and 15,713 st respectively.\\nThis brought July-February arrivals to 265,353 st (240,727 mt) compared to 216,068 st (196,015 mt) for the prior year period. Key suppliers to the US throughout July-February of the current fertilizer year included Canada at 154,542 st and China at 109,191 st.\\nExports\\nAS exports from the US were off marginally in February 2015 compared to February 2014 at 108,664 st (98,579 mt) and 115,908 st (105,151 mt) respectively. Brazil at 39,685 st and Canada at 18,993 st were the largest destinations for US AS in February. For the first eight months of the US fertilizer year, exports fell to 898,933 st (815,507 mt) from 1.03 million st (932,020 mt) during the prior year period. Key distinattions for US export AS were mostly in the Americas during July-February of this year, including Brazil at 443,166 st, Peru at 108,267 st, Canada at 58,363 st and the Dominican Republic at 57,551 st.\\nAN\\nUS: AN arrivals roughly even with prior year during July-February\\nAmmonium nitrate imports have been relatively steady this fertilizer year when compmared to one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, even though the US has trailed some international values for much of the July-February period. Market watchers are assuming the steady import trend in the face of discouraging pricing was due in part to some key importers choosing to meet their customer base\\'s needs through their historical channels. But declining US demand for non-industrial AN should start to show up in import volumes in coming months.\\nUS AN imports during February were 74,546 st (67,628 mt), down moderately from 84,502 st (76,660 mt) in February 2014. Almost all of the most recent month\\'s imports arrived from the Netherlands at 43,933 st and Canada at 29,999 st.\\nJuly-February AN arrivals in the current fertilizer year were up modestly from the prior year period at 358,873 st (325,567 mt) versus 341,041 st (309,390 mt). Key suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Canada at 267,082 st, the Netherlands at 66,236 st and Georgia at 20,723 st.\\nExports\\nWhile imports have been somewhat static, the US export market during July-February was up over 18% compared to the prior year period. February exports were roughly flat at 35,635 st (32,327 mt) versus 35,444 st (32,154 st). Canada was the primary destination for US AN exports during February at 23,586 st.\\nHowever, for the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February versus the prior year period exports increased to 338,111 st (306,732 mt) from 288,775 st (261,975 mt). Key destinations for US AN included Canada at 185,200 st and Mexico at 71,526 st.\\nAMMONIA\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nUS: February ammonia imports move US ahead of prior fertilizer year arrivals\\nUS ammonia imports have exceeded the prior fertilizer year through February thanks to a moderate increase in arrivals during that month compared to February 2014, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.\\nArrivals in the US during February 2015 were 462,500 st (419,311mt), up substantially from 323,747 st (293,701 mt) one year earlier. The increase was split between the two primary ammonia suppliers to the US, Canada at 103,589 st--up from 59,687 st one year earlier and Trinidad and Tobago at 345,176 st--up from 233,779 st.\\nThese gains pushed the US import volume for July-February modestly ahead of the prior-year period, at 3.79 milliont st (3.43 million mt) versus 3.67 million st (3.33 million mt). There was very little variation in volumes among the major suppliers to the US during the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year through February versus the prior-year period. Most of the imports during the most recent period arrived from Trinidad and Tobago at 2.49 million st, Canada at 721,422 st, Russia at 222,805 st and Venezuela at 196,122 st.\\nThe US export total through February of the current fertilizer year was 60,601 st (54,977 mt), down substantially from 124,799 st (113,217 mt) during the first eight months of the prior year. Primary destinations for US ammonia during July-February of this year were South Korea at 42,215 st and Chile at 11,026 st. February exports this year and last year were negligible.\\nUS Midwest: Severe weather hampering ammonia application again\\nThere is very little difference between winter storms and spring storms regarding their impact on ammonia applications in the Midwest. This week spring flash floods and tornados have replaced winter\\'s ice storms and snow from Kansas through Indiana.\\nIn much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Missouri work was stopped in its tracks, leaving distributors and retailers to wait for the ground to dry out again. On the other hand in the northern reaches of Illinois and Indiana corn planting is underway. Ammonia movement in Iowa and Nebraska has been more vigorous, and as much as two-thirds of the ammonia pre-plant material has been applied in those states.\\nAs previously noted, almost all the ammonia available for field work at this stage was purchased under forward programs, leaving the spot market in the region relatively untested. However, distributors east of the\\nMississippi especially are optimistic about demand for nitrogen for use as side-dress once the corn comes up. Ammonia is arguably over-priced compared to urea in the Midwest, but retailers are likely to raise prices for urea if demand for that product increases for side-dress applications.\\nFor now quotes east of the Mississippi River for new ammonia remain as high as $630/st FOB to retailers, while values generally are closer to $610/st FOB.\\nUS Tampa: Only anticipation left before May ammonia talks get underway\\nThere is little to do in the US Gulf market but wait for Mosaic and Yara to begin negotiations over Tampa pricing to cover May shipments. Presumably talks will get under way in the next couple of weeks. There would seem to be little doubt that Yara and other suppliers will boost their demands above the $485/mt CFR Tampa price tag covering Mosaic\\'s deliveries to Tampa during April. However, as noted likely it seems Mosaic would like to claw back some of its costs given the decline in DAP pricing in the US and overseas.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nUS Weekly Analysis\\nDAP barge values divided this week, with barges already moving north worth more than barges discharging in the US Gulf, or barges waiting without tows to begin the move to inland markets.\\nThe result was a roughly $15/st split between the two markets, with imported tons generally worth the same as domestic production.\\nSuppliers are increasingly discouraged about DAP demand this spring, viewing the decline in corn prices as forcing the hands of some farmers to mine the soil of nutrients to make a profit rather than applying phosphates at normal rates. Previously this concern was limited to potash crops.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nUS: DAP and MAP arrivals jumped in February\\nImporters showed improved timing in February, bringing 95,639 st (86,763 mt ) of DAP and 28,427 st\\n( 25,789 mt) of MAP to the US just a few weeks ahead of the annual re-opening of the upper Mississippi River system, according to the US Department of Commerce. One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).\\nAlmost all of February 2015\\'s DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.\\nDAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion\\'s share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer year through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.\\nUS Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue\\nMosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America. Expectations are that Mosaic and some other global producers are waiting for greater interest late next month from Brazil. In recent weeks Mosaic has little interest in competing for business in Argentina and other markets that will likely only lower price expectations further in key Brazilian trade.\\nMeanwhile, rumours persist that Mosaic is trying to build an export line-up to its own system in India and other importers in that country. Expectations are that the producer might load two large cargos through June, but so far Mosaic has declined to comment on the speculation. Likely returns from India given current prices in that country and the weakness in the prompt US market make India a reasonable alternative for the US producer in coming weeks.\\nIn the meantime, the US Tampa benchmark likely is not better than $470/mt FOB, assuming small cargoes to Central America still could yield higher returns than are indicated for Brazil and elsewhere.\\nUS New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications\\nBusiness has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders.\\nNevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.\\nUS Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails\\nDAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.\\nPOTASH\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nUS: Potash imports up 30% in Jan-Feb\\nThe US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in February, 43% more than the same month a year earlier and the highest February imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.\\nThe figures bring US year-to-date imports to 2.0 million mt, a 30% increase on Jan-Feb 2013 levels.\\nCanadian producers sent 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nThe US also imported 107,191 mt from Uralkali, 66,175 mt from BPC, 34,945 mt from SQM and 24,610 mt from ICL.\\nTotal US imports reached 10.5 million mt of potash in 2014, 10% (1 million mt) more than in 2013. After tonnage was re-exported through Portland, net imports were 8.0 million mt.\\nCanada: Potash exports at 3.0 million mt in Jan-Feb\\nCanada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data.\\nAs a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.\\nThe country exported 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nIncluding the exports from Portland, in February Canpotex exported 189,992 mt to Indonesia, 164,098 mt to China, 124,328 mt to Brazil, 72,393 mt to Malaysia and 58,121 mt to India.\\nCanada exported 17.3 million mt of potash in 2014, a 7.8% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly potash exports from the country since 2007. The country exported 9.2 million mt to the US in 2014, of which 2.5 million mt was re-exported out of the US from Portland.\\nUS Midwest: Seasonal pricing for potash appears set\\nAfter some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB in the Midwest.\\nThis level likely will be challenged in coming weeks, as distributors are expected to cut values in order to end the season empty. This is due to the prevailing view that crop prices will decline in coming months, bringing pressure on all input costs for the fall season.\\nUS Southern Plains: After last week\\'s start, field work slowed by more rain\\nGranular potash and other products still are being applied on higher ground in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week. Texas still is seing good activity, and corn sowing is underway in that state.\\nQuotes for granular potash are $390-395/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River.\\nSULPHUR\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nCanada: Vancouver FOB levels assessed lower on notional netbacks but indications scarce\\nVancouver FOB prices were assessed considerably lower week on week based on international CFR prices, although firm indications could not be obtained.\\nOver recent weeks, it has been reported that sellers were not considering bids below $170/mt FOB. But with this FOB price above even CFR prices available in any region, it is clear that this would be an unrealistic expectation.\\nPending further confirmation of price levels, values have been assessed at an indicative $140-150/mt FOB Vancouver, though most believe that sellers would in fact have to offer below $140/mt FOB to move volumes given current prices elsewhere.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nUS: February imports climb as European volumes high\\nUS imports of sulphuric acid for February were up 13% year on year to 275,985 mt.\\nCanada was the source of the majority of February tonnes, supplying 140,126 mt. This was followed by Mexico, which supplied 56,143 mt.\\nEuropean countries were the source of more acid imports than usual, with 24,038 mt from Germany, 19,315 mt from Finland, 18,927 mt from Sweden, and 17,001 mt from Poland.\\nThis marks the highest monthly volume from Germany since June 2011, from Finland since June 2009, and from Poland since April 2014.\\nCanada: February sulphuric acid exports decline 16.6%\\nCanada\\'s February exports of sulphuric acid declined 16.6% year on year to 140,148 mt.\\nAs is typical, effectively all of the exports went to the US.\\nNEWS\\nAGRICULTURE\\nUS: First US progress report finds positives for wheat crop, field work overall\\nIt is too early to expect to get a read on spring corn and soybean planting, but the first federal Crop Progress report of the new US spring season provided about as much good as bad news for the first week of April.\\nThe most positive indicator for farm income was the overall US average reported condition for winter wheat. Surveys of the 18 key states for that crop completed April 5 by the US Department of Agriculture show 44% of the winter wheat rated good or excellent, a significant improvement over last year’s finding of 35% for the same period.\\nThe US sorghum crop, forecast by the USDA to increase by 11% (about 750,000 acres) this crop year compared to last year, has not had a fast start this spring, with just 9% of the crop planted versus 15% for the five-year average. Cotton too is off to a slow start, with just 2% of the crop in the ground versus 6% for the five-year average as of April 5.\\nAs noted there was no measurable data for corn or soybeans provided by USDA last week, but there was positive news from the surveys of some of the key corn-growing states. The percentage of days suitable for fieldwork in much of the Midwest was higher or roughly even with last year, the agency report said. The Dakotas also saw a greater percentage of days suitable for field work.\\nPerhaps the most negative news for growers came from California, with regard to the drought hammered state’s subsoil moisture. USDA’s most recent survey found 35% of the state’s subsoil was “very short” of moisture and the condition of 50% of the state was defined as “short.” The national average subsoil moisture level was defined as very short for only 15% of surveyed areas and short for just 25%.\\nPROJECTS\\nCanada: K+S gets port facility permit for Legacy\\nK+S Potash Canada has received a permit to construct its port facility in Port Moody, British Columbia, where potash from the Legacy project will be shipped.\\nPacific Coast Terminals received the permit to modify its existing facility at Port Moody to accommodate volumes of potash from the Legacy mine, Saskatchewan newspaper The StarPhoenix reports.\\nThe facility at Port Moody will have the capacity to hold more than 150,000 mt of potash and major construction is set to start in the next few weeks.\\nCompletion of the construction is set to coincide with the opening of the Legacy mine in 2016. Legacy is projected to reach two million mt of production capacity by the end of 2017.\\nIn April 2014, Pacific Coast Terminals and K+S Potash Canada signed a long-term agreement for the storage and handling of potash from Legacy.\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

As the Chinese domestic season for phosphate applications winds down towards the end of this month or early May, port inventories in that country are expected to embolden buyers for India to make bids below $480/mt CFR, especially if Saudi output is building. US export giant Mosaic may also participate with June cargoes, as returns at $480/mt CFR are not far below current US barge values.\\nIf there is good news here for suppliers it is that low prices inevitably are the cure for low prices. India\\'s clout means whatever price is concluded for that market typically sets the floor during Q2 and Q3 for global values. Other buyers can expect to see higher demands once Indian buying returns.\\nIn the US domestic market, sales of imported DAP continue at a few dollars either side of $410/st FOB, the equivalent of $452/mt FOB US Gulf, suggesting Mosaic likely will come down to meet Brazilian expectations once pricing there is more settled. For now the producer is happy to holdout at a higher export indication until most of the US seasonal demand is met.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n•Argentina/Uruguay aim to pick off cheaper offers while others on side line\\n•Saudi continues to sell cargoes at top of range to India\\n•Rumours continue of US DAP cargoes for Q2-Q3 shipment to India\\n•SE Asia DAP sales completed across wide range\\n•European contract price talks for phosacid finally underway, maybe\\nTwo key enduser markets, the US and China, will have met their seasonal demands in coming weeks. This will leave producers in those countries to consider their price demands primarily on the backs of how much DAP/MAP is worth in India and Brazil. While this should lead to lower prices in May, it should also set the stage for a rebound as those endusers sweep up the lowest priced DAP and MAP. The combination of international sales and empty domestic systems in the US and China should enable suppliers to seek higher prices later in the summer.\\n\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails\\nDAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.\\nUS New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications\\nBusiness has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders. Nevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.\\nUS Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue\\nMosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America.

One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).\\nAlmost all of February 2015\\'s DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.\\nDAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion\\'s share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer year through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Bids and offers may remain far apart until May\\nBrazil\\'s market is weighed down by carryover from the prior season, a weak domestic currency versus the US dollar and strikes in the transportation industries.\\nBids and offers for new MAP and DAP cargoes in Brazil are at least $10/mt apart and neither buyers nor sellers expect to see that situation change until May, and new cargoes may not discharge before June in significant volumes.\\nImporters are looking to buy from US, Russian or North African suppliers at $465/mt CFR for MAP and DAP today, a value that likely will not be accepted by those sellers in the near term. Offers are suggested at $475/mt CFR for now, and Chinese material is indicated even higher.\\nArgentina/Uruguay: Trader buys DAP/MAP cargo, price tags still inching down\\nEuroChem sold 20,000 mt MAP and 20,000 mt DAP on a single cargo to load for Argentina and Uruguay in April.\\nWhile details are sparse, a previous purchase by Profertil below $480/mt CFR suggests this latest business was around $475/mt CFR for both products. This indicates a return to EuroChem of about $445/mt FOB whether it loads from the Black Sea or the Baltic, and assuming a margin for the trader involved, rumoured to be Nitron.\\nWhile EuroChem still has some April availability, a planned turnaround at its Kingisepp plant in May will limit forward availability, and may allow it to focus on its higher-priced customers in Europe, rather than selling further afield in the coming weeks.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Europe DAP demand all but over\\nThe DAP season over in France and the southern part of West Europe, and the end is approaching in Germany, though the season will continue through April for corn application.\\nEurochem is expected to announce a new price for April but in the meantime DAP prices, almost exclusively Lithuanian, are holdiing in the range of $525-530/mt FCA Terneuzen.\\nSome limited demand for DAP in the local truck markets is reported.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nTunisia/Turkey: GCT and Gubretas still locked in DAP talks\\nAs of last week GCT had not indicated anything firm for April pricing. With the European season almost over, the Tunisians are likely to be concentrating on talks with Turkish buyers.\\nAs of last week, Morocco\\'s OCP was indicating $515/mt FOB in Southern Europe, which may mean a deal close to $505-510/mt FOB is possible. GCT likely will aim to match the same range.\\nSaudi Arabia: Ma\\'aden and Sabic agree Indian sales\\nMa\\'aden is now fully committed through April and early May after agreeing recent sales into India. Ma\\'aden sold a 30,000 mt DAP cargo to Kribcho in India at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April.\\nA second cargo from the Saudi producer of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.\\nMa\\'aden says it is now fully committed through April and early May but has received enquiries from May onwards from India, Pakistan, East Africa and South America. The company\\'s last shipment to Latin America was to Yara and priced on a formula.\\nThe seller last week indicated it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business into Pakistan.\\nUnder a recent MoU, Sabic sold a second DAP cargo to Zuari of 30-35,000 mt at about $485-86/mt CFR India with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced similarly at $485- 486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.\\nMa\\'aden has now signed contracts with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered between April this year and March, 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment.\\nMorocco: OCP plans for Brazil still unclear\\nAs reported last week, OCP plans to switch its attention to increased phosacid and NPS shipments through April.\\nFollowing on from last month\\'s settlement of phosacid prices in India, OCP will now focus its attention on shipping increased volumes of acid from Morocco. It will ship reduced quantities of DAP/MAP in April while balancing granulation according to demand. The final three 50,000 mt NPS shipments for Ethiopia will be loaded through April/May along with additional NPKs for Nigeria and West Coast Africa, as detailed in last week\\'s report.\\nDAP/MAP production will be limited with just 20-30,000 mt allocated for the European market and nothing firm as yet for Brazil. Serious phosphate demand in Brazil is widely said to be 30-40 days away.\\nAfter loading 260,000 mt for the US in February/March, it is believed OCP plans no more US April shipments but has allocated 1-2 cargoes for Q2.\\nOCP indicated a price last week for DAP of $515/mt FOB for Europe.\\nQ2 discussions for phosphoric acid into the Northwest European market are expected to be taking place imminently.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: Still no new DAP sales confirmed\\nFirming freights have meant producers have increased their price ideas for product delivered into Karachi.\\nSaudi\\'s Ma\\'aden indicated last week it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business in Pakistan.\\nIndia: Three April Saudi DAP cargoes confirmed\\nSome new business was reported this week to India from Saudi Arabia even as buyers awaited an annoucement on the new NBS rates.\\nLast year the NBS rates were announced on April 4 but not until May 2 in 2013.\\nKribhco confirmed it purchased a 30,000 mt cargo of Saudi DAP from Ma\\'aden at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April. A second Ma\\'aden cargo of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.\\nThese two sales increase the top end of the DAP Bulk CFR India Spot price by $3/mt. The benchmark is now assessed at $480-489/mt CFR.\\nZuari has bought a second cargo of 30-35,000 mt from Sabic (under an MoU) at about $485-486/mt CFR with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced at $485-486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.\\nMa\\'aden has now agreed MoUs with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered\\nbetween April this year and March 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment. The exact division is unclear though Kribcho has agreed to take about 250,000 mt, Zuari will take 100,000 mt leaving a third buyer, thought to be IPL, with about 350,000 mt.\\nPhosAgro is visiting several buyers including IPL/IFFCO and the two companies are considering the purchase of two to three DAP cargoes once clarity emerges over the NBS.\\nPrice ideas for Chinese DAP are around $480 CFR with Saudi product in the mid-to-high $480s/mt CFR.\\nRCF is expected to take another one or two days to finalise its DAP tender.\\nWith regard to the MRP, the current range for most producers is between INR 23,300-23,800/mt. IFFCO has maintained a lower MRP through Q1 at INR 23,200 but is planning to increase this by INR 500/mt to INR 23,700/mt. TCL, one of OCP\\'s JV partners, is heard to have raised its MRP already to INR 24,260/mt.\\nIndia: January DAP imports up nearly 40%\\nIndia imported 116,781 mt of DAP in January, a 39% increase on January 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nIn January, Saudi Arabia supplied 65,810 mt or 56% of the total import volume, while the US supplied 50,970 mt or 44% of the total import volume.\\nGTIS data for the full calendar year 2014 showed Indian DAP imports at 3.8 million mt, higher than 2013 when just 3.6 million mt were imported. Imports over the previous four calendar years had averaged 5.5 million mt DAP.\\nIndia imported 199,788 mt of phosacid in January, an 83% increase on its January 2014 imports, according to GTIS data. Almost 80% of the imports came from OCP which limited its export shipments to only its joint venture partners during Q1. For Q2 it is expecting to increase volumes to a level similar to Q4 2014 when around 100-120,000 mt P2O5 per month was supplied from Morocco.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Phosphate prices showing signs of further weakness\\nChinese phosphate prices are showing further signs of weakness as major MAP demand in Brazil is yet to emerge and domestic DAP consumption is currently limited. Exports are expected to be high through April.\\nPhosphate and NPK producers in China can comfortably afford the current sulphur price, but are holding off as they anticipate sulphur will decline further in the weeks ahead.\\nConcern among sulphur suppliers at the lack of Chinese demand is causing producers to drop prices, but this is yet to stimulate a buy-side reaction. Chinese delivered sulphur is currently assessed at $150-160/mt CFR.\\nSome Chinese phosphate producers have planned maintenance in April and May, so operating rates are expected to decline in May, with normal production expected to resume from late June.\\nDistributors and traders say small and mid-tier phosphate companies may delay maintenance as they seek to supply the export market from April, rather than from late May/June. These smaller producers are likely to produce at rates of around 80% to maximise exports.\\nFor the largest producers (such as YTH and Wengfu), for whom maintenance was scheduled in May, plants are not expected take complete shutdowns. Operating rates are instead likely to drop to 60-70% from 80% for three or four weeks, before normal production is resumed.\\nExports to India between February and April will have been comparatively high due to a need by Indian importers to replenish stocks ahead of the next season and on the Chinese side, facilitated by the removal of seasonal export restrictions from the beginning of 2015. The weaker RMB has also encouraged Chinese suppliers to take advantage of additional export opportunities.\\nThe lower end of DAP Bulk FOB China Spot is assessed by Fertilizer Week as slightly lower on last week at $460-470/mt FOB. Most large producers have booked their production through April and don\\'t have product available for prompt sale. However, domestic DAP sales are said to be very slow, not just for seasonal reasons but also due to the price advantage MAP and NPKs currently hold over DAP.\\nSome regional markets such as Northwest China, demand has been postponed due to extreme weather conditions. Ploughing time has been pushed back by at least one or two weeks. Demand in Northern and Northeast China is also limited.\\nProducers will not currently move much volume to ports as they do not expect to see a sharp increase in monthly shipments in April or May, hence there has been no obvious growth of port inventory.\\nAs seen last week, MAP remains under pressure. Chinese granular 11-44-0 can sell at $350-360/mt FOB, according to sources in China, with granular MAP 10-50-0 at around $405/mt FOB. MAP Bagged EXW 11- 44-0 is assessed at RMB 1,900-2,000/mt, a decline of about RMB 125/mt week on week, with 10-50-0 at RMB 2,100-2,200/mt, down RMB 75/mt on last week.\\nMajor buyers are still said to be traders rather than end users with demand and supply roughly balanced. No negotiations are not yet under way for deliveries after mid May.\\nSome traders are reportedly eyeing exports to the US of granular 10-50-0 or 11-52-0 for June onwards, but no business was heard to have been concluded at the time of writing.\\nVietnam: Australian DAP bought at $500 CFR\\nIncitec Pivot is reported to have sold a cargo of around 20,000 mt Australian DAP into Vietnam at $500/mt CFR for end April loading. The producer was not immediately available to confirm the trade.\\nElsewhere in Vietnam, cargoes of bagged DAP were traded at $490/mt CFR Ho Chi Minh and cross-border trade with China was reported at $475-480/mt CFR.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Phosacid negotiations expected\\nThe market still awaits news of Q2 phosphoric acid contract negotiations for Europe.

The bad news for suppliers comes even as seasonal demand emerges in the US Midwest and Southern Plains. While this has been supportive of current pricing, the supply chain is well stocked according to distributors. Expectations are that cheaper input costs next year will allow US farmers to return to historical application rates. However, there are no confirmed reports of fill pricing from Mosaic for the summer.\\nElsewhere the market has been seasonally quiet with many of the major players in China this week. Indian importers are taking a breather having lined up sufficient tonnes to cover immediate requirements and build up a buffer stock ahead of the season. They are also awaiting final confirmation of the NBS rates, which although are expected to remain largely unchanged, will need to be confirmed to give real clarity on pricing.\\nChinese producers meanwhile are relaxed with a solid quantity of export business on the books for the major producers in India and some curtailments as a result of planned maintenance. As such they are holding firm on price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB with many still citing numbers at the mid-upper end of this range. Buyers are quoting lower numbers and rumours have been circulating that sales in the mid $470s/mt CFR India have been concluded however there is no firm evidence as yet to back up these\\nreports. Nevetheless buyers are putting pressure on Chinese suppliers to reduce prices below $480/mt CFR for the next round of import purchasing. If values for non-Chinese product hold in the mid $480s/mt CFR for India, then US exports also will be competitive in that market.\\nIn Brazil the import campaign is yet to start. However the freefall in price indications seen in recent weeks appears to have been halted with Russian producers said to be offering at higher levels for May. Mosaic meanwhile has dropped its export price down to $460-463/mt FOB which although moving in the right direction is still equating to a CFR level well above current indications from Brazilian buyers. Current in Brazil prices remain unsupported by any real volumes but perhaps a floor, albeit temporary, has been found.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Mosaic drops its price to $460-463/mt FOB Tampa\\n∙Rollover in NW European phosphoric acid contracts for Q2\\n∙Rumours of lower prices in India but no firm confirmation\\n∙NBS rates yet to be announced\\n∙Chinese prices remain in range of $460-470/mt FOB\\n∙Bangladesh to issue tender for private sector import of DAP and TSP\\nShort Term Outlook\\nThe market is likely to remain quiet through to May and even mid-May by which time most producers will have completed their respective turnarounds. Although the market will remain weak until then, it will stabilise as the key importers return to the marketplace such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh and Turkey. The import prospects for India and Pakistan are looking positive, given a normal monsoon, while the longer the Brazilians delay, the shorter the import window and the more condensed it will become. As such the market could get quite interesting by June particularlry as two major Chinese producers are foregoing MAP production and concentrating their efforts on DAP only. The potential downside risk could come from increased production in Morocco as OCP ramps up JPH-1, but OCP has proved that it will curtail production if demand warrants such a move.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Export benchmark moves down\\nThe Tampa benchmark fell by as much as $10/mt this week with a sale by Mosaic of 15,000 mt of DAP sold to Latin America at $460-463/mt FOB for May shipment. In the meantime, rumors of possible sales of DAP cargos to India continued. The decline in US Gulf Q2 liquid sulphur costs likely making that market more attractive over the summer. It also reduces the likelihood of market related curtailments. However, some traders believe Mosaic may consider such a move depending on upcoming MAP pricing for Brazil and elsewhere.\\nUS Midwest: DAP moving, but demand expectations lower\\nExpectations about spring demand for DAP and MAP have been replaced by reports of deliveries of previously ordered material and new spot sales.\\nWhile phosphates are moving, distributors say it has become apparent that farmers are cutting phosphate application rates, even on rented ground. Landowners understand that renters will lose money if fertility requirements in contracts are enforced to the letter this year, given current input costs, land rents and new crop pricing. Anecdotal reports expect demand in the Midwest region to be off by around 20% compared to the prior year, although much of that decline will be due to fewer corn acres in the region compared to last year. Prices for truck loads remain around $460/st FOB.\\nUS New Orleans: Barge values flat with steady demand\\nMost DAP trades in the US barge market were cited around $410/st FOB this week for barges in the Gulf or prompt load dates.\\nBarges up the river traded at higher values, with Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri business still cited around, $415-$420/st FOB, in line with last week. Reports of trades, bids and offers for MAP barges are across a range either with no premium to DAP to up to $5/st more expensive.\\nBuyers’ timidity in prior weeks and even in the current market is helping to support New Orleans prices in the near term, with endusers exhausting alternatives before committing to further barges. This has left sellers in a position of strength. However, inland buyers are buying only with this season in mind.\\nUS: Export rate continued to gain through March\\nUS DAP and MAP export volumes in March of this year were 169,111 st (153,416 mt) P2O5, up from 142,873 st (129,613 mt) P2O5, according to the latest producer data from The Fertilizer Institute.\\nThis trend continued for much of the current fertilizer year that has seen US exports stay moderately ahead of July-March shipments in the previous year , at 1.59 million st (1.44 million mt) P2O5 this year versus 1.36 million st (1.24 million mt) P2O5 for 2013/14.\\nA comparison of export destinations between March of this year and March 2014 does not show a significant difference in destinations. Primary destinations for US DAP/MAP during March of this year included Brazil at 47,788 st P2O5, Mexico at 20,941 st P2O5 and Australia at 18,346 st P2O5.\\nFor the first nine months of the current fertilizer year through March, US DAP/MAP exports were dominated by its historically key customers of Brazil at 340,551 st P2O5, India at 258,629 st P2O5 and Canada at 258,375 st P2O5.\\nMexico: Fertinal committed through May\\nFertinal is committed through May with shipments to South America and the domestic market.\\nWith the Australian shipping programme now over, Fertinal has shifted its attention to markets closer to home until the Australian season resumes later in the year. As such it has just finished loading 33,000 mt DAP/MAP on the Orient Tide for Ameropa/Argentina and Uruguay, as reported previously. The tonnes were priced on a formula basis.\\nThis will be followed by a 35-40,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP cargo for Chile loading late April and a second Latin American cargo is believed to be loading in May. In addition, Fertinal will be supplying the domestic market and on the basis of all these shipments, will therefore be fully committed through to June. Price levels remain unchanged in the $460s/470/mt FOB range. It is now discussing H1 June business.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Little change as buyers continue to take as needed\\nThe market remains unchanged in terms of demand but prices have continued to weaken over the past couple of weeks.\\nBrazilian buyers are yet to really show their hand and return to the market in earnest for the main import season. There appears to be no rush and at least two major suppliers are prepared for further delays to the start of the import campaign. Price indications for MAP remain weak although there are signs that maybe a floor has, at least temporarily, been reached.\\nFollowing reports last week of Russian offers as low as $460/mt CFR, it would appear that these have now moved up with talk of $470/mt CFR being indicated for May. Again speculation over price is rife with price levels varying depending on whether traders are long or short and with a lack of volume sales to support any true price.\\nOCP has refrained from shipping any MAP this month but has sold around 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S to various buyers in the $470s/mt CFR for April shipment in four lots. This will be used both for blending as well as direct application and could displace some demand for 11-44-0 where the additional sulphur is needed.\\nMosaic has dropped its price once again, this time indicating a price out of Tampa of $460-463/mt FOB equating to the upper $470s/480/mt CFR Brazil level , still above current indications from the buyers.\\nChinese MAP producers are foregoing MAP where they can and producing DAP instead in order to take advantage of better netbacks in Asian markets. With two major producers, Hubei Yihua and Wengfu not producing any MAP grades at all for export this year, it will be interesting to see how this affects availability of these grades for the Brazilian market through the key import months.\\nBrazil: Q1 P2O5 consumption falls 13% year on year\\nDespite some improvement in March, Brazilian P2O5 consumption fell by 13% overall in Q1.\\nLatest ANDA data show that consumption of P2O5 in March fell by 3% against 2014 and although an improvement on January and February, overall sales in Q1 fell 13% year on year.\\nNevertheless despite not reaching the record levels of 2014, Brazil consumed 44% and 48% more P2O5 in Q1 this year than it did in 2013 and 2012 respectively.\\nLooking at import volumes there is a clear and sharp decline in the import quantity of almost all phosphate fertilizers, particularly MAP, in Q1 but only when compared with 2014. If we compare the volumes of MAP and DAP to 2013, imports this year were up by 19% and 15% respectively.\\nAverage Q1 imports for the past three years, between 2011 and 2013, were 385,000 mt so this year\\'s imports have been only marginally below this number.\\nThis all reinforces the view that Q1 2014 was an anomaly prompted by higher crop prices, lower fertilizer prices (just $410-420/mt CFR Brazil when buyers first returned to the market) and greater confidence in the market arising from, amongst other factors, a more stable exchange rate. As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, this year Brazil has merely reverted to its normal seasonal buying patterns.\\nBrazil: Imports and Production (‘000 mt Product)\\nMAP Imports arrived in Q2 (‘000 mt product)\\n857 737\\nTaking all the available data, it becomes clear that availability in Brazil remains at manageable levels and comparable with last year, even accounting for the drop in consumption and a higher surplus at the end of 2014. As such, demand in Q2 should be relatively robust and even allowing for a less bouyant agricultural and economic backdrop, should translate into steady demand going forward.\\nSource: ANDA * excluding any surplus from previous years\\nCONAB has also released its monthly update projecteding total corn production at 79 million tonnes, with the full season crop seen at 30.3 million and safrinha 48.7 million. Although 10% of Mato Grosso safrinha planting in occurred outside the ideal planting window, conditions have been very good and encourage good crop growth. However, late April and early May will be the key yield determining period. CONAB has also raised its forecast for soyabean production to 94.3 million tonnes, exceeding the previous record by over 5 million tonnes.\\nEUROPE\\nBulgaria: Iran emerges as Agropolichim\\'s TSP primary market\\nLatest GTIS data for January show Agropolichim export 31,500 mt TSP to Iran that month. There were no other exports of TSP, DAP or MAP in January.\\nBulgarian TSP exports reached a high of 226,000 mt in 2014 of which 157,000 mt were shipped to Iran, almost 70% of all Agropolichim\\'s export availability. The balance was delivered into West Europe with 24,000 mt each to Belgium and France and small lots to other West European markets.\\nWith more emphasis being given to TSP, export availability of MAP was lower in 2014 while DAP remained unchanged from the previous year. Just 20,000 mt MAP were exported last year in small lots to Romania, Hungary and Austria. Of the DAP, 42,000 mt went into Romania although some of this may have been transported further into Europe.\\nPoland: Further growth in NPK exports to Venezuela\\nGTIS data for January show 15,000 mt Polish DAP delivered into Germany.\\nJust 52,000 mt DAP were exported in 2014 which although a higher volume than in 2013, was still considerably lower than in previous years. Police has continued to place greater emphasis on the production of NPs and NPKs.\\nIn January Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark. Total exports in calendar year 2014 reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity more than 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons probably being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.\\nPoland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.\\nTurkey: DAP tender scrapped and negotiations continue\\nIgsas scrapped its tender of April 10 for 10,000 mt DAP.\\nGubretas continues to negotiate its annual phosphate requirement with GCT/Tunisia. An agreement is expected shortly.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP well committed through April\\nOCP is well committed through April but with limited DAP and MAP shipments.\\nOCP remains well committed through April and into early May with shipments to Africa, Europe and\\nBrazil. However, no DAP, MAP or TSP will be shipped to Brazil this month, instead OCP will ship 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S in four shipments sold in the mid $470s/mt CFR to various importers including Heringer. The product will be used both in blending and for direct application. OCP has indicated that it is not interested in the recent low prices seen in Brazil for MAP and if solid demand is still not evident in May, it will ship further quantities of phosacid into India.\\nLooking at the rest of the April line-up, as reported previously in Fertilizer Week, OCP will also load the balance of its Ethiopian cargoes, a total of 150,000 mt in three lots. The first has already loaded, the second will load shortly and the third will load at the end of the month/early May.\\nIn addition it will load close to 100,000 mt DAP/MAP/NPKs to other African markets including 16,000 mt DAP to Mali/Senegal, 5,000 mt to the Ivory Coast, 6,000 mt MAP to Algeria, and 25,000 mt DAP/MAP to South Africa (mainly DAP). Additional NPKs will be delivered into Nigeria.\\nJust 25-30,000 mt DAP will have been delivered into Europe in April, sold between $510-515/mt FOB Jorf Lasfar including sales to Fertiberia/Spain.\\nOCP will also load two lots of MAP, one 6,000 mt parcel for Italy sold at a premium to DAP for non-fertilizer use, and the second cargo comprising 8,000 mt high grade MAP for Mexico.\\nThe domestic market will take 25-30,000 mt DAP and NPKs in April. Morocco has raised its wheat import duty to 75% to help protect the local cereal crop, which is expected to see a bumper harvest of 10 million tonnes (6.7 million in 2014).\\nThis all equates to around 360,000 mt DAP in product tonnes equivalent when calculated on a P2O5\\nbasis. OCP has total granulation capacity of nearer 500,000 mt DAP per month but only if phosphoric acid is diverted from export use. Otherwise when phosacid exports are back up to the normal (higher levels i.e. this month) it is nearer 350,000 mt.\\nIn addition to this, OCP will ship 110-120,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid to India, around 15,000 mt to Saudi Arabia and, regular quantities to Brazil and Europe and the normal 30-35,000 mt P2O5 to Pakistan from the Pak-Maroc joint venture plant.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Market quiet and rumours abound\\nAs most of the traders and importers gather in China this week, rumours of cargoes being traded at lower prices, in the mid $470s/mt have been circulating.\\nSo far there is little evidence backing up these reports and even a number of the major buyers are refuting these rumours. Although prices for Chinese tonnage may fall below the $480/mt CFR level, they are not expected to fall dramatically. Chinese suppliers are holding firm to current prices in the range of $460-470/mt FOB and show no intention to drop prices further in the near future. Indian CFR prices at or around $480/mt equates back to the mid/upper $460s excluding any trader\\'s margin.\\nA delegation from PhosAgro visited India last week and further DAP/NPK cargoes are said to have been sold in addition to the NPK cargoes previously sold to Deepak and IPL and the DAP cargo to IFFCO; the DAP in these cargoes was priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Further details on the new business have not yet been confirmed and may not be until the NBS rates are formally announced.\\nUttar Pradesh Co-op is expected to issue a re-tender for 100,000 mt DAP. Hudson was awarded the full quantity from the original tender at $478/mt CFR held in January but failed to deliver.\\nRCF has still not awarded any tonnage against its DAP tender of March 16 for 65,000 mt and it is widely thought that this tender will be scrapped.\\nThe NBS rates have not yet been announced. Whereas last year they were announced at the beginning of April, in 2013 the announcement was not made until May 2.\\nJust over 1 million mt DAP has been confirmed to date, excluding new business from Russia. An estimated\\n2.4million mt DAP in the form of MoU agreements has been agreed to date between Saudi, Jordanian and Chinese suppliers and the major buyers for the current fertilizer year.\\nThe latest port data information is as follows:\\nwww.crugroup.comPhosphates Weekly Report | 13\\nIndia: MMTC issues new DAP tender\\nMMTC issued a DAP tender for 30,000 mt black or dark brown DAP (18-46-0) +/- 10%, closing 1400 hrs in New Delhi on April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada. Both technical and price offers will be opened on April 23. Offers to be remain valid for 15 days.\\nBangladesh: Tender to be issued for private sector DAP/TSP requirement\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has decided to issue a tender to determine the supply of the forthcoming crop year\\'s DAP and TSP import requirement via the private sector.\\nA total of 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP may be imported through private sector companies in 2015/16 and a tender to this effect is expected to be announced shortly, to close end April/early May.\\nThis quantity is below the quotas given to the private sector last year for 2014/15 of 460,000 mt DAP and 250,000 mt TSP. Against this quantity 220,000 mt DAP were supplied from China and 136,000 mt DAP from Australia. China used to be a major supplier of TSP to Bangladesh, shipping 400,000 mt in 2009, but since 2012 there have been no imports of Chinese TSP due to alledged quality issues.\\nIn calendar year 2014, against the long standing government-government agreement, BADC (Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation) imported an additional 150,000 mt DAP and 190,000 mt TSP from OCP/Morocco and 300,000 mt TSP from GCT/Tunisia according to GTIS and IFA data. A similar quantity will be allocated to the public sector again for 2015/16. OCP has been shipping more TSP in Q1 to Bangladesh due to supply issues from Tunisia.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Producers aim to hold firm on price\\nAs much of the industry gathers in China this week, the main topic is the Chinese DAP price going forward.\\nChinese producers are holding firm on the DAP price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB. There have been rumours of sales concluded in the mid $470s/mt CFR India but as yet no firm evidence to back them\\nup. Indian buyers are putting pressure on the Chinese to drop the price below $480/mt CFR, a price which gives a netback in the mid-high $460s/mt FOB China excluding traders\\' margin. Hubei producers generally have a freight advantage but producers like YUC are not only selling direct but also ship panamax vessels, again giving a more attractive netback.\\nAs Indian demand slows down following the rush of buying seen in recent weeks, Chinese producers are taking advantage of the quieter period to undertake annual maintenance. Both YUC and Kailin are taking rolling turnarounds through April and into May which will reduce overall production by around 25-\\n30%.Wengfu started its month long maintenance programme this week, taking each of its two phosphoric acid units down at a time, thereby reducing overall production by 50%.\\nAs reported previously in Fertilizer Week, both Wengfu and Hubei Yihua are now focusing almost exclusively on DAP, foregoing production of all grades of MAP in favour of DAP, and in the case of Wengfu, purified phosphoric acid or PPA. Having not sold any DAP into India at all in 2014, Wengfu will be looking to establish a presence in this all important market this year and already we have seen it sell three cargoes to CIL with a fourth on offer, at competitive prices relative to other suppliers.\\nMost producers are bypassing granular MAP for export due to the low netbacks currently being seen in the Brazilian market as the return on DAP remains significantly higher. Even at $470/mt CFR Brazil for granular 11-52-0, the netback would be close to $440/mt FOB China, well below the equivalent netback for DAP in India and more costly to produce.\\nIt remains to be seen how the absence of two of the major producers will affect availability of MAP once the Brazilian season gets under way in earnest. Certainly prices will have to improve to prompt other producers, with the flexibility to switch between products, to move away from DAP and back to MAP especially as Indian DAP demand is forecast to see a solid improvement on 2014.\\nThe issue of VAT has once again come to the fore. Latest speculation suggests that the government will re- introduce VAT on fertilizer sales from September this year at a rate of 13%. Producers will be able to offset VAT already paid on raw materials and other inputs against this rate. As such, CRU estimates that the VAT will mean that producers are looking at an additional cost of between RMB 50-100/mt on the cost of producing DAP.\\nThe National Bureau of Statistics sees rice plantings in China expanding 1.2% this year, with corn up 1.9%. This will help to boost domestic fertilizer demand.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNW Europe: Rollover agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts\\nA rollover has been agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts in NW Europe.\\nAn agreement was reached last week between OCP and its customers in NW Europe for the Q1 price for phosphoric acid to be rolled over into Q2. As such the price range for CFR NW Europe will remain unchanged at $900-990/mt P2O5 CFR NW Europe for shipments up to and including June. Some Moroccan contracts were agreed at slightly higher prices but the overall range remains unchanged. Phosacid from non- Moroccan sources remains at the more competitive end of the price range while the upper end of the price range represents a higher grade Moroccan acid to customers taking smaller quantities.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Slow rate of Indian phosacid imports this month\\nIndian phosphoric acid imports appear to be relatively light so far this month.\\nA combination of higher prices, turnarounds and the delay in the announcement of the NBS rates appear to have caused phosphoric acid rates to slow down this month. However, with OCP planning to ship 110- 120,000 mt P2O5 in April and again in May to India, arrivals should soon start to pick up.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nEUROPE\\nBulgaria: Syrian rock imports continue at a steady pace.\\nAgropolichim imported 25,000 mt Jordanian rock in January this year according to the latest GTIS data, along with a further 9,000 mt from Syria.\\nFor calendar year 2014, phosphate rock imports reached a high of 578,000 mt comprising 231,000 mt from Syria, 216,000 mt from Morocco and 130,000 mt from Jordan. Syrian deliveries have remained at an average of 222,000 mt per year since 2012 but in the two previous years, the volume was well over 300,000 mt. The quantity from Morocco jumped last year, mainly displacing tonnage from Jordan.\\nPoland: More rock arriving from Senegal\\nPoland imported 100,000 mt phosphate rock in January this year, according to the latest GTIS data.\\nCargoes came in from Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and a further 10,000 mt from Israel.\\nVolumes from Grupa Azoty\\'s own reserves in Senegal have been increasing slowly but steadily since 2013. In calendar year 2014, a total of 220,000 mt Senegalese rock were shipped to Szczecin of which 150,000 mt were shipped in H2.\\nOverall imports in 2014 from all sources reached 1,266 million mt with Algeria supplying 564,000 mt or 45% of the total. Additional quantities came in from Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Togo, Turkey and Israel.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nTunisia: Severe curtailments again hit phosphate rock production\\nYet again production of phosphate rock in Tunisia has been severely curtailed by sit-ins and local unrest.\\nFor the second consecutive week, production and/or transport of rock has been halted at most of the major mines in the Gafsa region, including Redayef, Oum Larayes , Metaloui , Kef Eddour and Kef\\nChefayer. According to local press reports, only the mine and beneficiation facilities at M\\'dhilla are currently operating. Unemployed protesters have been organising sit-ins at a number of the mines as well as the railway stations at Redayef and Oum Larayes while also blocking water supplies to the mines.\\nRail transport is however operating between Metaloui and Mdhilla to feed the downstream plants at Gabes, M\\'dhilla and La Skhira (including Tifert). Private truck companies are also being used to transport the rock to the plants to meet ongoing off-shore commitments.\\nAs a result of the problems, rock production is reported to have fallen to an estimated 15% capacity.\\nAccording to a statement made to the press by the director general of the CPG (Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa), Q1 production of phosphate rock failed to meet its original target of 1.56 million mt. Instead output fell almost 40% against Q1 2014, to just 604,000 mt in the first three months of this year compared with 983,000 mt last year.\\nIt was only recently that the new government had announced that it had made the phosphate industry in Gafsa one of its priorities for its first 100 days of office, as reported by Fertilizer Week April 2. It had laid out plans for the production of rock to reach 500,000 mt per month in March, April and May but clearly this volume will not be reached in March/April. Officials have stated that continued efforts are being made to find solutions to \"this very difficult situation\".This included setting out a new set of measures at a high level meeting on April 13 to re-examine the cause of the problems, conducting an audit on the management approach of CPG and its subsidiaries to ensure \"good governance\", sending a government delagation to the region to address the problems first hand and dedicating a in Inner Cabinet meeting to the situation in May.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Q2 Rock contracts yet to get started\\nNegotiations are yet to start for Q2 phosphate rock contracts in India and may not until the NBS rates are formally announced giving clarity on the subsidy and market prices going forward.\\nSuppliers will be pushing for an increase in the wake of the $40/mt P2O5 hike in phosphoric acid prices for H1. Buyers will be citing the weak DAP market. DAP production in India via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option, particularly given the lower sulphur prices. If buyers achieve a good price for Q2 rock which maintains this advantage, we can expect a robust level of imports going forward.\\nImports to date for this calendar year stand at 2.31 million mt,a little less than this time last year. Imports for the full four months between January-April totalled 2.8 million mt with 837,000 mt arriving in April alone.\\nNP/NPKS\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nVenezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014\\nVenezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland\\'s Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

In India and Brazil where both markets should be at the height of their import season, the impasse between buyers and sellers continues.\\nPakistan has seen further buying interest this week with a sale from China and Saudi Arabia reported but with a higher price paid for the Chinese material, thereby bucking the normal trend. Much of the Chinese DAP coming into Pakistan is sourced from the Hubei Yihua plant and is well respected in the marketplace and the gap in price between the various origins is beginning to narrow accordingly. Firmer freights from China have supported a drive for higher prices also.\\nAlthough indicating higher prices in Pakistan and achieving some increase compared with previous sales, Chinese suppliers are unlikely to achieve a similar increase in India. Indian importers continue to put pressure on suppliers to reduce prices from the $480/mt CFR level by $7-10/mt to a range of $470-475/mt CFR. The rupee has been particularly volatile this week, spiking to INR64.3 at the beginning of the week to INR63.6 against the dollar at presstime today. The latter rate raises importers\\' margins at $480/mt CFR (and a MRP of INR 24,000/mt) from 1% to 2% but this still excludes any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.\\nMuch depends on the monsoon but in theory India still has substantial tonnes to buy for the Rabi season despite the large quantities already booked to date. Low stocks and low production levels have prompted the greater H1 volumes of import tonnage booked. It can slow down its import programme and is likely to do so as it watches the monsoon but will not want to delay too late to avoid a similar situation to 2014 when a last minute surge in demand coincided with the Chinese autumn season and prompted a spike in\\nprice. Nevertheless China, although currently in the peak export season with no alternative afforded in the domestic season or indeed much outside the Indian subcontinent, can play the waiting game also and it still remains to be seen who buckles first.\\nThe Brazilian market remains very quiet as farmers assimilate the new Harvest Plan with its additional funding but with the higher interest rates that go with it. The weak crop prices are a real problem and with a higher cost of credit, farmers may continue to cut back on phosphate usage. This week\\'s ANDA data make gloomy reading with a drop of 26% in consumption of P2O5 in May, the largest monthly reduction to date this year and well below the level of May consumption in previous years. Here buyers are also resisting suppliers\\' attempts to drive prices higher for July and the impasse is expected to last for another week or more before one or other caves in.\\nMosaic will continue to ship to India, and presumably add cargoes for Brazil once a price agreement is found. However, the key for the producer remains the domestic market even though seasonal demand has been met. Mosaic is expected to begin railing refill tonnes to its consignment warehouses in July, and these volumes will reduce its need to search for further export opportunities. So far competing phosphates from China or Morocco are not on the radar for the US Gulf, although Russian suppliers appear willing to accept US returns on small volumes.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Two new sales reported for Pakistan in mid-upper $480s/mt CFR\\n∙Lithuanian DAP sold into Turkey at around $510/mt CFR\\n∙Phosacid negotiations start but no agreement\\n∙Demand in South Africa as Moroccan and Saudi tonnes sold\\n∙Mosaic will refil US domestic maw over summer.\\nSulphur\\n∙Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards march, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq\\'s latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.\\nAmmonia\\n∙Lack of clarity over price direction continues to stall ammonia activity. Despite weak demand east of\\nSuez, prices edged up slightly on CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award at $448/mt CFR.\\nShort Term Outlook\\nThe Brazilian market continues to disappoint and although there are some still anticipating a last minute surge in buying for the September season, current economics would suggest otherwise with more of the same hand to mouth buying expected going forward. With US domestic prices also attracting no import interest for the coming months, the attention will focus on the Indian subcontinent to provide much of the activity over Q3 and probably the direction for the market. Both Brazil and India are needed to support the market during this period but without much impetus from either, prices may falter. So much therefore depends on the monsoon, even just from a psychological standpoint, as we head into Q3 and the start of the next round of import activity.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S Plains: Wet weather halts further phosphate use\\nSoybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.\\nNevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Little movement expected ahead\\nDistributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.\\nUS Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market\\nMosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.\\nMarkets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.\\nUS NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP\\nPrompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.\\nUS: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady\\nUS DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nMay 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.\\nMexico: Fertinal committed through to September\\nDeliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.\\nFertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.\\nFor July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July\\'s production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.\\nAn estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.\\nProduction levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.\\nThe increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.\\nPrice levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Import interest wanes and prices stall\\nThe Brazilian import market remains very quiet with buyers resisting moves by suppliers to raise the price for MAP 11-52-0/12-52-0 above $500/mt CFR to $505-510/mt CFR, as is currently indicated for Russian and Moroccan product. As such the price range for this week has been assessed at $498-500/mt CFR.\\nOCP is currently in discussions with buyers for July shipments but as yet no tonnes have been placed.\\nDemand for Chinese 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 has started to ease off in China as few traders want to take positions for cargoes from mid July onwards for fear of both port congestion and demand worsening through August/September. As such prices in China for new sales of 11-44-0 for H2 July onwards have dropped off to $370-375/mt FOB giving landed prices sub $400/mt CFR depending on freight. For near term delivery into Brazil, prices are still in the low $400s/mt CFR.\\nYUC is producing granular 11-52-0, essentially for the Brazilian market, with its earliest shipment by the end of June and one cargo per month available through Q3 if needed.\\nHeavy congestion is being reported at Paranagua this week with delays of between 10-30 days reported at the fertilizer quays where a total of 24 vessels are expected, including 4 carrying MAP. At Santos, there is a\\ndelay of 11 days with 10 fertilizer vessels expected. Delays at the fertilizer terminals at the other main Brazilian ports are currently less than 5 days.\\nBrazil: ANDA data show 26% drop in May P2O5 use\\nThe latest ANDA data show a 19% drop in January-May P2O5 consumption with a 26% decline in May itself against 2014. The actual volume of P2O5 consumed over the full five months was the lowest since 2011.\\nImports of all phosphate fertilizers into Brazil fell by 27% year on year January-May with DAP down by 36% and MAP, SSP and TSP all down by 26-27% compared with the same period a year earlier. The import volume for this period was also 19% down on 2012.\\nBy contrast, Brazilian production of phosphate fertilizers rose by 4% in the first five months compared with the same period last year. Both MAP and TSP output increased by 7% year on year.\\nLooking at the demand/supply balance we can see that the availability to date appears to be in balance with demand. More costly credit lines and lower crop prices continue to cast a cloud across the whole fertilizer market. Brazilian corn prices continue to fall below cost of production levels, and are likely to move lower as\\nthe safrinha crop harvest rolls on. This is likely to see full season corn planting fall yet again once fieldwork begins in September and will continue to impact demand across the nutrients.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nFSU: Turkish sale netback in mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic\\nEuroChem sold 25,000 mt Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment at around $510/mt CFR cash duty free. With a freight rate in the mid $20s/mt, the netback is in the mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic.\\nNegotiations are ongoing for further sales into Turkey for July/August.\\nSales to nearby and domestic markets have left Belorechensk sold out until 15-20 July. For Kingisepp, a cargo for mid July is now available. EuroChem is indicating $505-510/mt CFR for July shipment to Brazil. At current freights this would netback to $484-489/mt FOB Baltic excluding trader\\'s margin but Brazilian buyers continue to balk at paying above $500/mt CFR.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Sale of 20,000 mt Lithuanian DAP\\nEuroChem has sold a 25,000 mt cargo of Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment, in combination with 15,000 mt AS. The price for the DAP is heard around $510/mt CFR duty free cash and the buyer, although not confirmed at presstime, is believed to be Gubretas.\\nGubretas would normally be receving regular supplies from Tunisia at this time but the DAP plant at Gabes is yet to restart production after the two month stoppage. An initial 20,000 mt DAP delivery was supplied by GCT at the end of May out of stocks at the Tunisian plant but until the plant resumes steady production, further deliveries into Turkey will remain suspended.\\nBuying has been subdued in Turkey since the IFA meeting when a flurry of DAP and NP cargoes were booked. To date up to 280,000 mt DAP has been booked. Assuming that the full quantity of 100,000 mt is shipped from Morocco, a further 100-120,000 mt DAP is still theoretically required, ideally for Q3 shipment, and buying activity should start to pick up over the coming weeks. Cargoes from Jordan and Lithuania, both duty free, are likely to cover any outstanding demand not met from Tunisia.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: New sales to Pakistan\\nMa\\'aden sold a cargo to Engro/Pakistan over the past week in the mid $480s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment. As reported last week, Sabic also has a cargo booked for Pakistan, to United Agro, for July shipment, also priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR, giving an estimated netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK.\\nSaudi DAP has become more competitive in Pakistan, priced at or even below prevailing Chinese prices from Hubei Yihua and as such, the Saudi market share has risen this year to just over 55% of the import market to date.\\nSabic reports two sales of MAP for July shipment to South Africa both priced in the mid $480s/mt FOB. The first 25,000 mt cargo is for loading on July 3 and the second 30,000 mt cargo on July 15. Netbacks on South African business from RAK are currently more attractive than for sales to Brazil.\\nThis brings Sabic\\'s sales for July to date to 85,000 mt DAP/MAP excluding any cargoes to its regular customers in India. As such Sabic is said to be sold out for July and indicating in the $490s/mt CFR India WC and Pakistan for August.\\nTunisia: Little change at Gabes\\nThe latest reports suggest that DAP production is yet to resume at Gabes due to further disruptions to rock supplies. Even though rock production has been resumed at the mines, there are still pockets of unrest disrupting the transport from the mines to some of the downstream plants. GCT had hoped to restart phosphoric acid production at the complex by the start of Ramadan but this does not appear to have been achieved as yet.\\nMorocco: OCP targets Brazil and Europe for July\\nBrazil and Europe, including Turkey, will be the target markets for Moroccan DAP and MAP in July. Price indications for Brazil are in the range of $505-510/mt CFR whereas for Europe OCP is quoting the same range as for June, around $510-515/mt FOB Morocco.\\nAs yet no sales for July have been booked in either market but OCP sold a second 30,000 mt MAP cargo to South Africa for end-June loading at a price said to be close to $490/mt FOB.\\nDemand in Southern Europe is starting to pick up and with no DAP currently coming out of Tunisia, additional sales opportunities for Morocco will be present over the coming weeks.\\nFor the Turkish market, OCP booked the first 30,000 mt DAP vessel against its agreement with Toros for up to 100,000 mt for June-September shipment. The vessel will load end June/early July.\\nPlans to load an 80,000 mt MAP/DAP vessel to the US in July are still under discussion and will depend on demand in the US. Prices at NOLA are still unattractive to potential off-shore suppliers, equating to around $450/mt CFR.\\nAs previously reported, OCP will ship a panamax to China at some time in Q3 against its government- government agreement but the actual date has not yet been fixed.\\nNPK sales to Nigeria are also under discussion for July and as yet no tonnes are believed to have been booked.\\nOCP will ship 75,000 mt TSP against awards in the recent Bangladesh private sector tender for Q3 shipment. As reported previously, the netback on this business is in the low $400s/mt FOB Morocco.\\nThe new 1 million mt DAP/MAP plant is still in the commissioning phase and is still scheduled to start commercial production in early Q3.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBangladesh: Awards dominated by China\\nAlthough the final supplier details remain unconfirmed, awards for the 400,000 mt DAP in the Ministry of Agriculture\\'s recent private sector tender will be mostly covered from China. Just one cargo has been awarded to Quantum/Australia.\\nNetbacks for the lowest-priced DAP offered from the Hubei Dongsheng plant are sub $460/mt FOB, but this is not reflective of the Chinese market today and is believed to be a result of trader positioning rather than actual netbacks offered by the producer.\\nMost of the offers were at around $490/mt CFR which would give a straight netback to China in the upper\\n$460s depending on freight and excluding margins. The netback on the Australian cargo is reportedly in the low-to-mid $470s/mt FOB Townsville.\\nShipment has been requested by September.\\nIndia: Imports reach 1.45 million mt DAP in April/May\\nThe latest data released by the Department of Fertilizers show DAP imports for the first two months of the current fertilizer year, April/May, of 1.449 million mt. The breakdown by origin is as follows:\\n854,000 mt from China\\n338,000 mt from Saudi Arabia\\n172,000 mt from Russia\\n55,000 mt from the US\\n30,000 mt from Jordan\\nIn terms of importers over the April/May period, IFFCO and IPL received 383,000 and 279,000 mt respectively or some 46% of the total to date. Chambal, Kribhco and Zuari each took between 138-165,000 mt with the balance accounted for by TCL, Mosaic, Deepak, Shriram, PPL, MCFL and CIL.\\nIn terms of NP/NPK imports over the same two month period, IPL imported 124,000 mt with Deepak and Kribhco at 44,000 mt and 38,000 mt respectively.\\nOf this total, 148,000 mt NP/NPKs were sourced from Russia and the balance of 58,000 mt from China.\\nIndia: Up to 2.5 million mt DAP imports still needed\\nAdditional DAP cargoes have been added to the June line up over the past week bringing the new total to just over 1.2 million mt. Official DoF data show a further 1.45 million mt arriving through April/May (see separate update for further details). Together with the cargoes arriving through Q1, the total quantity imported for the Kharif season is now just short of 3 million mt.\\nFertilizer Week estimates that about 1.5 million mt remains outstanding against the MoU agreements for the current fertilizer year (excluding the recent PhosAgro agreement which combines NPKs and DAP). Whereas\\nthese agreements are not set in stone, we can assume that this quantity or thereabouts will be shipped over the forthcoming months to build up support for the Rabi season.\\nRabi consumption over the past four years has averaged 4.7 million mt. Taking the 1.5 million mt MoU tonnage together with domestic production between July-March of an estimated 2.7 million mt (based on 300,000 mt/month average), total availability will be around 4.2 million mt.\\nMuch depends on the level of Kharif consumption and the stocks that will remain by September. But given a healthy drawdown on inventory, this volume of 4.2 million mt would theoretically be insufficient to cover potential demand for the Rabi and leave some opening stock for the following year. It also assumes\\na comparatively robust domestic output which in reality may not be sustained through the whole period, particularly if H2 phosacid prices remain on the higher side.\\nTherefore additional spot imports over and above the MoU tonnes could be needed of as much as 1 million mt (up to 2.5 million mt in total with MoU tonnes) through H2 but with the overall quantity dependent on how the monsoon eventually progresses. Ideally the bulk of these tonnes should be shipped July- September. Doubts over the monsoon at this time last year led to a delay in purchasing and a consequent surge in last minute imports during September/October, coinciding with the Chinese domestic market and consequently pushing prices up.\\nIn 2014, a total of 1.23 million was imported into India in Q3, rising to 1.63 million mt in Q4, compared with 2.1 million and 747,000 mt in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively.\\nImporters will prefer to avoid a late surge this year but will also want to delay the next tranche of spot buying to a) guage the behaviour of the monsoon and b) push prices down in the near term to provide some cushioning against the current rupee volatility.\\nThe rupee has traded between 64.2 and 63.7 against the US dollar over the past few days as the currency markets speculate on US interest rates and the US Federal Reserve\\'s next move.\\nGiven a rate of INR 64 flat against the dollar and a maximum retail price of INR 24,000/mt, an import price of $480/mt CFR provides importers with a margin of barely 1% and does not include any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.\\nImporters therefore continue to push for numbers closer to $470/mt CFR which would provide a basic margin of 3%. Suppliers from China are resisting any move from current values, particularly in the light of the recent firming in freight rates.\\nPakistan: Engro buys Saudi DAP in mid $480s/mt CFR\\nEngro has purchased a cargo of DAP from Ma\\'aden at a price in the mid $480s/mt CFR for end June/early July arrival. Pakarab is linked with a Chinese cargo in the high $480s/mt CFR and Fauji is also expected to finalise a cargo for June/July shipment by the end of the week. Against its recent enquiry, it received prices in the mid-high $480s/mt CFR, mostly of Chinese origin.\\nEngro will have had three DAP cargoes loading in May/June, two from Ma\\'aden and one Chinese cargo from Trammo. The reason for the decision to buy a third cargo was to lock in additional prompt tonnes for delivery by July 1 ahead of the proposed import tax increase. The threat of such an increase has since receded as reported last week in Fertilizer Week.\\nSuppliers have increased their price ideas into Pakistan for July with Chinese offers now in the high\\n$480s/mt CFR, having moved up from the low $480s/mt CFR for June. One of the arguments cited by suppliers of Chinese DAP is the higher freight, now being indicated at around $19/mt, up by $2-3/mt on previous rates.\\nSaudi tonnage has become as competitive as Chinese in some instances and as a result, out of the cargoes booked for 2015 arrival, over 55% has been souced from Saudi Arabia to date with 35% from China. This is a reversal of the trend seen last year which saw the market dominated by Chinese imports.\\nIncluding the Fauji cargo not yet confirmed, close to 440,000 mt DAP has been booked for shipment into Pakistan this year and represents close to half the import quantity required for the year.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Higher prices achieved in Pakistan\\nFirmer freights have been one of the main arguments cited by Chinese suppliers in price discussions in Pakistan for July cargoes. One sale has been reported this week in the upper $480s/mt CFR Karachi, up from the low $480s/mt CFR previously, which at current freights of around $19/mt would netback to the high $460s/mt FOB, still within the current price range published in Fertilizer Week.\\nCurrent prices for sales into South and Southeastern Asia, excluding India, are in the range of $467-470/mt FOB. For India the range is between the low-upper $460s depending on whether to EC or WC and size of vessel.\\nIn India meanwhile the stalemate on price continues with buyers still pushing for a reduction of around $7- 10/mt in line with the rupee depreciation and suppliers maintaining a firm price nearer $480/mt CFR.\\nOf the 1.2 million mt in the line up to arrive into India in June, approximately 870,000 mt will have been shipped from China, a substantial quantity compared with previous years. It not only reflects the earlier start to the Indian DAP campaign due to lower opening stocks but also the increased flexibility afforded to Chinese suppliers following the removal of the export window.\\nOne question frequently asked is how much DAP the Chinese producers can store at the ports. This is particularly relevant given the current situation in India at the moment with buyers holding off while they gauge the progression of the monsoon and at the same time put pressure on the price.\\nPrior to 2014 producers were bound by the rigid export windows and therefore tried to push as much into bonded warehouses as possible ahead of the closure of the export windows. The time taken to transport product along the Yangtse river, for example, and into the ports, was also much longer, requiring more planning by producers.\\nThis year there is no need for the bonded warehouses and the speed and efficiency not only of the transport to the ports but the throughput at the ports has meant that for many producers it is merely a few days from leaving the plant to being available for export at the seaports.\\nA lower volume of other commodities has also freed up capacity at the ports for fertilizers. As such producers can be more flexible and act at relatively short notice on export orders. This is partly why inventory levels reported at the ports this year have been comparatively low. In terms of actual storage, it is estimated that as much as 1 million mt DAP could be stored if necessary.\\nAvailability for 11-44-0 from mid July onwards has increased as traders back away from taking positions for the Brazilian market for H1 July onwards. As such prices have weakened to the $370-375/mt FOB range for this period.\\nYUC has confirmed the production of granular 11-52-0 and will load its first cargo at the end of June and will have around one cargo per month thereafter if demand is there.\\nFEDERATED STATE OF ASIA\\nVietnam: Chinese cross-border tonnes dominate\\nChinese cross-border DAP is priced at around $475-480/mt CFR in bags, a level too cheap for product coming through the seaports to compete with. As such interest in bringing any vessels into Vietnam through the official import channels remains extremely limited.\\nTSP\\nEUROPE\\nBulgaria: Iran takes 75% of TSP exports\\nQ1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.\\nQ1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt TSP of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: MoA issues new TSP tender\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture issued a new tender for 28,000 mt TSP, plus urea and MOP, closing on June 29 for delivery in bags by the end of September.\\nAgainst the MoA\\'s earlier tender that closed on June 9 for 18,000 mt TSP, an award is due to be confirmed within the next 2 days to Swiss Singapore for the full quantity. Swiss Singapore offered the lowest price in this tender at $339.33/mt CFR and $341.30/mt CFR with 180 and 270 days credit respectively.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Phosacid exports got boost in May\\nUS phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nThe jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.\\nThe main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Phosacid negotiations stall\\nNegotiations started this week in Dubai between OCP and its joint venture partners for Q3 contract shipments into India. Buyers are looking for a sizeable reduction in price against the current level of $805/mt P2O5 CFR while OCP is expected to be looking for a small increase or at least a rollover. These initial discussions did not however result in any agreement.\\nBangladesh: BCIC issues tender for 50,000 mt phosacid\\nBCIC, on behalf of the DAP fertilizer Company (DAPFCL), issued a new tender for 50,000 mt solution phosphoric acid (52-54% P2O5) closing on July 29 for shipment in five lots of 10,000 mt solution to the CUFL jetty at Chittagong as follows: 1st , 2nd, 4th weeks of November, 1st and 2nd weeks of December.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nEUROPE\\nPoland: Update on Senegal rock project\\nIn the 12 months ending March 2015, Grupa Azoty imported almost 230,000 mt rock from its mining concession in Senegal, almost double the volume imported in the previous 12-month period. It plans to reach 300,000 mt in the current calendar year.\\nThe company is close to completing the feasibility study on the phosphate project. In a recent statement the chairman indicated that a decision on whether to proceed with extending the concession will be taken shortly, on completion of both the feasibility study and an environmental report. The existing mine is small with limited resources so to reach the group\\'s aim of becoming self sufficient in rock, the development of a larger mine is necessary for which the cost has been estimated at PLN 500-600 million ($135-160 million). Police\\'s annual rock requirement is currently around 1 million mt rock.\\nIt is also working with the Senegalese government with a view to supplying fertilizers into Senegal and in February shipped 10,000 mt NPKs.\\nBulgaria: Record rock imports\\nAgropolichim imported 152,400 mt phosphate rock in Q1 comprising 72,300 mt from Morocco, 55,000 mt from Syria and 25,000 mt from Jordan. While the volume from Syria was down on recent years, the quantity imported from Morocco increased.\\nRevamping work at Agroplochim\\'s Devnya plant has led to increased demand for phosphate rock. In the 12 months ending March 2015, Bulgaria imported just over 600,000 mt phosphate rock, a record 12\\nmonth volume according to GTIS data.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: RCF tender for 40,000 mt phosphate rock\\nIndia\\'s RCF issued a tender for 2 x 20,000 mt low grade phosphate rock (+/-10%), minimum 29% P2O5/63% BPL, closing on July 9 at 14:30hrs in New Delhi. Offers are to be valid for 30 days.\\nRCF requested the first 20,000 mt cargo be shipped to Mumbai in August with the second for October shipment.\\nBangladesh: Moroccan rock lowest in BCIC tender\\nAgainst its tender of June 16 for 30,000 mt phosphate rock (72% BPL minimum), BCIC received four offers. The details are as follows:\\nNP/NPKS\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices\\nThe European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.\\nEuropean NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea for 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB or the\\nequivalent when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 continues to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.\\nBelarus: NPK exports flat January-April\\nBelarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nBelarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarussian NPKs was suspended in August last year.\\nIn the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.\\nBelaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to around 240,000 mt.\\nThe company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.\\nIn 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision\\nNigeria\\'s fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack of clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.\\nThe current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).\\n\"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen,\" Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.\\nNigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.\\nOCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.\\nFertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Price for corn, wheat and soybeans all increased sharply this week in a weather dominated market, with bullishly interpreted USDA data adding further support. Indeed the crop price index is now at its highest point since mid January.\\nAt the same time concern over a potential shortage of product in the face of zero imports booked for the Fall season has supported the barge price increase. As prices move higher, imports will start to become more of a reality although as yet the differential to the global market is not quite narrow enough to prompt cargoes to be booked but it is probably just a matter of time. The widely expected Moroccan tonnes will almost surely load some time in August/early September.\\nShould Brazilian MAP demand not warrant any volume selling from Morocco through August, the US will look even more attractive to OCP. By mid September the peak Brazilian season will be over but Europe will yet be starting so outlets at that time will be sought for Moroccan tonnes. Maintaining market share in the US with new capacity coming onstream will surely be a crucial move going forward. Although OCP has been able to benefit hugely from production constraints in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan, this trend may be short lived and OCP will need to re-establish its own key markets.\\nIn India, a two tier market is beginning to appear with a clear differential between prices offerd by traders for Chinese product and those offered by producers for a direct sale. Producers are becoming more aggressive in the all-important Indian market, looking to remove the middle man where possible and reap the benefits of direct selling. This explains the higher prices offered in recent tenders/enquiries by traders compared with the sales made by producers.\\nThe rupee has stabilised at around 63.5 against the dollar, relieving some of the pressure from importers and as such the market has stabilised in the mid-upper $470s-low $480s/mt CFR but sizeable July tonnage is yet to be priced. Importers are reluctant to price tonnes too far ahead given the tendency for rupee volatility and continued concern over potential rainfall through July and August.\\nBrazil remains the big disappointment in terms of phosphate demand this year. The lack of volume demand is putting renewed pressure on traders holding long positions, which is in turn putting renewed pressure on price levels. Current prices appear to be nearer the $490/mt CFR level although remain largely untested on limited business. However, hopes by suppliers of achieving $505/mt CFR for July have been extinguished as the market limps along, constrained by the dismal economic backdrop.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙NOLA price moves up with upper end at $430/st\\n∙Two tier market for Chinese DAP opens up in India between trader and producer prices\\n∙Brazilian market weak with MAP prices closer to $490/mt CFR\\n∙OCP secures more acid sales\\n∙GCT resumes production at La Skhira but Gabes remains down\\n∙Crop prices increase in US\\nSulphur\\n∙Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level, representing a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR. The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.\\nAmmonia\\n∙Few price changes have been noted across the ammonia price index on a distinct lack of activity. Koch continues to buy up tonnage west of Suez but this is doing little to affect values\\nShort Term Outlook\\nMany in the market have already assumed that a final surge in import demand will not now be forthcoming from Brazil over the coming weeks. Whether it does or it doesn\\'t, the combination of supply constraints in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa plus good prospects for demand from both India and Pakistan and potentially the US should keep the market reasonably stable through the next couple of months. Should Brazil suddenly find some form before the end of its season, this could prompt prices to firm however this latter development is looking increasingly unlikely unless there is a sustained improvement in to the negative economic factors that weigh heavily over the market.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Small sales continue\\nMosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.The price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Demand over, fill is next concern\\nWith seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.However, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer\\'s expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture\\'s forecasts will have to hold.\\nUS NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains\\nIncreases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.\\nThe bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.\\nMAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.\\nUS: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1\\nThe January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers\\' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.\\nAt the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers\\' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.\\nThe February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers\\' inventory at month\\'s end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014. March 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year.\\nInventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.\\nTotal production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of 2% compared with the previous year.\\nUS producers\\' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.\\nFebruary shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014.\\nDuring the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July-March, US producers\\' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: Prices weaken to nearer $500/mt CFR\\nRecent sales have been concluded in the range of $500-505/mt CFR with current offers said to be even lower. With Brazilian demand far lower than anticipated for the time of year, long positions are beginning to build prompting competitive offers of MAP from most origins , e.g. Australian, Russian and Chinese (YUC granular 11-52-0), into alternative markets.\\nBrazil: Market stalls and prices stay weak\\nThe market in Brazil remains weak in the low $490s/mt CFR but these prices have not really been tested over the past week. Volumes are thin and demand remains limited. reports also suggest that inventories on the ground are healthy with imports arriving against previous sales and buyers reluctant to risk holding unnecessary stocks in the current economic climate.\\nThe market remains very weak as yet another week goes by with little real demand although some are hoping that the increase in soybean prices this week might prompt some renewed interest.\\nSome suppliers are still looking to achieve at or above $500/mt CFR but these levels are not workable today with demand so slow. Part cargoes from trader longs are heard sold at significantly lower levels over the past couple of weeks and although sub $490/mt CFR is not currently evident, the market would certainly appear to be nearer $490 than $500/mt CFR today.\\nReports indicate that Russian and Australian product is on offer in the low $490s/mt CFR if not lower and Ma\\'aden has a 40,000 mt cargo for H1 shipment to South America.\\nYUC is producing granular 11-52-0 in China and is indicating at or above $480/mt CFR which would equate to the low $500s/mt CFR Brazil on a direct sale basis. Eurochem too is indicating $485/mt CFR for new business but this also does not tally with recent or indeed offers being made into Brazil from current trader positions which would equate back to sub $470/mt FOB Baltic.\\nOCP has made no sales into Brazil during July and is not expected to do much if any volume business there until August if at all this season. Neither demand nor price prompts the normal volumes that OCP would expect to ship into Brazil at this time of year. In June it shipped 200,000 mt MAP/DAP preceded by 200,000 mt MAP/DAP/NPS 12-46-0+7S in May.\\nMosaic continues to ship into its own system in Brazil but has not made any new spot sales here for a number of weeks. Based on its latest spot prices at $470 FOB US Gulf range and a freight of $17/mt, it would theoretically be the only major producer in a position to offer into Brazil at a competitive level.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP benefitting from supply constraints\\nOCP has added to its July line up this week with two additional sales of phosphoric acid comprising 15,000 mt solution to South Africa and 30,000 mt solution to Turkey equating to just over 50,000 mt DAP. Although\\ngranulation has not yet started at the new JPH-1 plant, the phosphoric acid plant has been running for several weeks, some surplus acid could theoretically be made available between now and when the granulation begins towards the end of the quarter.\\nIn the meantime, OCP remains comfortable going through July, as detailed in last week\\'s Fertilizer Week report, with DAP/MAP sales to Turkey, South Africa, Algeria and Europe totalling as much as 210-230,000 mt plus a further 85,000 mt NPKs for Nigeria and other West Africa. The lack of Brazilian demand has been compensated for by the production issues in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa which have opened up additional outlets for Moroccan DAP/MAP/TSP and acid in markets such as Turkey, South Africa, Europe, Bangladesh and of course India.\\nAs the US NOLA price moves up, the chances of Moroccan tonnes loading in August become more likely.\\nSaudi: Port data show increase in May exports\\nThe latest estimates indicate Saudi production and export rates close to capacity. Price levels in India for July are under discussion with buyers expecting a level close to $480/mt CFR or just above.\\nData for the port of Ras al Khair show exports of fertilizer in May at 264,000 mt, the largest monthly volume for the year to date. Between January-April, monthly exports were mostly in the range of 180-190,000 mt with the exception of February which had dropped to 141,000 mt. Total exports between January-May from Ras al Khair totalled 960,000 mt.\\nFor May, a total of 11 vessels were loaded and the breakdown by country included an estimated 160,000 mt for India, and 30,000 mt for Pakistan.\\nTotal production capacity at MPC\\'s Ras al Khair plant is 250,000 mt DAP/MAP per month.\\nOfficial data for June is not yet available but preliminary estimates suggest that around 220,000 mt was loaded last month, as per the table below.\\nFor July, the only Indian shipment to date confirmed is the Kribhco cargo for Ma\\'aden loading in the last week. The price is not yet agreed and is currently under discussion. Further Saudi tonnes are expected for July from both Sabic and Ma\\'aden against agreements with Zuari, Chambal and IFFCO. As such production rates and exports are expected to remain close to capacity.\\nPrice levels in India are still believed to be in the very low $480s/mt CFR for Saudi tonnes while in Pakistan recent sales have been in the mid $480s/mt CFR.\\nTunisia: La Skhira restarts but not Gabes\\nProduction has resumed at the TIFERT phosphoric acid plant at La Skhira but DAP production remains suspended at Gabes. Protestors have been blocking the railway lines into Gabes over the past month with a continual sit-in and as such the plant is unable to receive a regular supply of phosphate rock.\\nWith a return to business at La Skhira, phosphoric acid shipments to the two Indian joint venture partners, GSFC and CIL, can be resumed for Q3. Shipments to date this year for India have been extremely limited due to the renewed problems to beset the industry since December 2014.\\nMeanwhile GCT has no DAP availability for its regular Q3 customers, namely Turkey and southern Europe. OCP has already stepped in to cover part of the shortfall from Tunisia for the Turkish market, specifically to supply Gubretas with 100,000 mt in July. If GCT\\'s plant can start production over the coming weeks, Turkey and Europe, specifially southern Europe, will be the priorities.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: CIL books 50,000 mt Wengfu DAP for July\\nCIL purchased 50,000 mt DAP for July shipment direct from Wengfu, with the buyer claiming a price below $475/mt CFR. Neither of the two 50,000 mt cargoes required by CIL for August shipment has yet been booked. Trader offers meanwhile remain at higher prices, at or above $480s/mt CFR.\\nAgainst its enquiry of June 24 for 65,000 mt DAP and 35,000 mt NPK 10-26-26, Deepak received around 8 offers for the DAP mostly in the range of $480-485/mt CFR. Deepak subsequently countered at $475/mt CFR but as yet has not agreed any tonnes.\\nAgainst its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for 1H August shipment, RCF has not yet made an award but is expected to make its next move by the end of the week. As already reported, it received six offers with the lowest submitted by Wilson International, backed by Yidu Xingfa, on 35,000 mt for shipment into Gangavaram at $483.00/mt CFR. MMTC, backed by Hubei Chuxing offered the next lowest for Gangavaram or Mundra, at seller\\'s option, at $483.95 or $484.95 respectively. Rare Earth backed by YunnanHonxing, offered the lowest price for delivery to Mundra at $485.80/mt CFR.\\nThe trader offers of around $483-484.00 into India equate back to between $468-470/mt FOB China depending on freight but exclude any trader\\'s margin and provision for hedging. When taking these additional costs into account, the netback is closer to the $460/mt FOB China level.\\nRecent reported sales at the $478/mt CFR India level or lower are for panamax sales and generally concluded direct, i.e. without the need for any trader margin, thereby giving a netback in the low/mid $460s/mt FOB. These direct sales have proved more attractive not just to the suppliers but to the bigger buyers who are able to reap the benefits offered in the form of lower landed prices.\\nAny movement in the rupee will continue to have a direct impact on landed prices to India. Having crept above 64.2 against the rupee mid June, it has since settled back at around 63.6, bringing some relief to importers faced with the prospect of eroding margins once again.\\nMonsoon: Another positive factor to start the month with has been the level of June rainfall despite falling from a high of 28% above the LPA (Long Period Average), but still ending the month some 13% above. The heavy rains seen across much of the country have boosted reservoir levels that had been comparatively low from last year, in some cases to levels above the 10-year average, an extremely significant development going forward and for the Rabi season, should the monsoon fail to perform through Q3.\\nJune rains account for just 18% of the average monsoon rainfall with July and August accounting for 33% and 29% respectively and the balance falling in September. Therefore even though the heavy June rains have encouraged a robust level of Kharif planting (up by 23% yoy as of last week) and boosted water levels, it is the coming weeks that will be the most crucial.\\nIndia: RCF opens price offers\\nRCF has opened price offers against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for H1 August shipment in two lots, 40,000 mt to Mundra, WCI and 35,000 mt to Gangavaram, ECI.\\nPrice offers were as follows:\\nPakistan: Data show need for 650,000 mt more DAP\\nLatest NFDC data show both P2O5 and DAP consumption for May recorded at a high of 68,000 mt P2O5 and 110,000 mt product respectively. Off-take for the first two months of the Kharif season, April-May, has been extremely positive with a 20% year-on-year increase in P2O5 usage and a 17% increase in DAP. DAP sales were also 57% higher than the four-year average for this period.\\nAs such the NFDC has revised up its consumption estimate for the Kharif season to 629,000 mt, up from last month\\'s estimate of 618,000 mt.\\nThe latest NFDC report suggests a sizeable shortfall in imports for the current season but only takes into account those imports that have actually arrived into the country during April/May. The real import volume is much higher as documented over the past few weeks in Fertilizer Week and currently stands at an estimated 440,000 mt for the calendar year of which 83,000 mt is included in the opening balance and a further 65,000 mt as arrivals in April/May. Almost 300,000 mt has been booked for June/July shipment and hence added to the table below.\\nOverall consumption of DAP looking robust for the year and, barring any unforeseen negative variables, is expected to reach last year\\'s volume of 1.7 million mt which necessitated imports of around 1.1 million\\nmt. Therefore we can expect a similar volume of imports for this year, prompting a requirement for up to 600- 650,000 mt to arrive before the end of this calendar year.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: Market dominated by YUC material\\nThe DAP market has been dominated by cross border sales of YUC green product priced below the CFR equivalent of $500/mt CFR HCM in bags. As such there is no interest in product from other origins either in or outside China.\\nFarmers prefer to buy the green or natural DAP from YUC, and if this is currently in the market, there is little interest in any other type of DAP. Even if at the same price as darker coloured DAP from China, (once favoured by the market) farmers seemingly will opt for the YUC product.\\nThe netback on the YUC DAP is said to be around the low/mid-$470s/mt FOB China, but sales are concluded on a cross-border basis and as such are in extremely small lots.\\nChina: Two-tier market in China as industry gets competitive\\nWengfu\\'s sale of a July panamax, allegedly in the mid $470s/mt CFR India would netback into the low/mid $460s/mt FOB China, well within the current price range as reported in Fertilizer Week. Panamax rates to India EC are close to $10/mt but this sale is for a 2 port discharge suggesting a slightly higher rate. A two-tier market is developing in India with Chinese product as traders struggle to compete with sales being concluded direct by the producers.\\nOver the past couple of weeks, trader offers of Chinese DAP into India appear to have been consistently higher than offers and indeed sales concluded by the producers who have sold direct to the buyer. Prices in recent Indian tenders have been at or above $480/mt CFR while sales of panaxes by the larger suppliers have been concluded in the upper $470s or potentially lower in the case of CIL\\'s purchase. Traders are faced with limited margins and a more competitive stance from the industry.\\nMost recent sales to India have been concluded in the mid $460s/mt FOB China. There have been some sales of YUC DAP into Vietnam reported in the low $470s/mt FOB but these would appear to be cross\\nborder tonnes sold in very small parcels and not large enough to be reflected in Fertilizer Week\\'s price range.\\nYUC is producing gMAP 11-52-0 at its Tian\\'an Chemical plant, formerly known as Furui. It is currently producing the MAP on its two DAP trains but will switch back to DAP if demand does not support further production runs. The plant has an annual capacity for 600,000 mt DAP equating to around 50,000 mt per month. A price of $480/mt FOB or higher has been indicated for the 11-52-0 which would equate to the\\nlow $500smt CFR Brazil and higher if including trader\\'s margin. Current price ideas are in the $490s/mt CFR Brazil for 11-52-0 with limited demand.\\nPrice indications for granular 11-44-0 for late July are nearer the $365/mt FOB level and remaining weak, reflecting waning demand from Brazilian buyers all too aware of time constraints in shipping product from China after mid July.\\nThe phosphate industry will be maximising export sales, particulalry for DAP, between now and mid-August when demand from the domestic season will start to pick up to build supplies for the autumn season.\\nRain has been an issue in China in recent weeks. According to Martell Crop Projections the North-Eastern province of Heilongjiang, responsible for around 18% of China\\'s corn production, heavy rain that began in May has intensified through June, with rainfall at 150-200% of normal levels. This is said to have hampered corn planting and therefore DAP, NPK and urea consumption are all likely to be impacted.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Talks underway on NW European Q3 acid contracts\\nOCP is currently negotiating Q3 phosacid contracts with its customers in NW Europe and hopes to finalise prices by next week. It is looking for an increase on the back of its recent $5/mt P2O5 increase achieved last week in India for Q3 and Q4.\\nTo justify a further increase in Europe, OCP is citing a tight market, prompted by production constraints in Tunisia and South Africa.\\nOCP also reports two new sales of phosphoric acid with 30,000 mt solution to Turkey and 15,000 mt solution for South Africa, both for July shipment. The price was not disclosed.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: July arrivals not yet deterred by higher price\\nClose to 80,000 mt phosphoric acid solution is arriving into India during 1st week July with volumes boosted by a Senegalese cargo and another thought to originate from JIFCO/Jordan, both for IFFCO. The TIFERT\\njoint venture plant in Tunisia has resumed production after a two month stoppage and cargoes for CIL and GSFC should materialise from August if not before.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Rock import demand expected steady through Q3\\nRock imports continue at a steady pace supported by more attractive production costs from the imported rock/sulphur route compared with imported phosphoric acid, particularly given the recent increase, albeit nominal, in acid prices for H2.\\nEven though sulphur prices have also edged up, the price differential remains relatively wide between the two production routes and as such, demand for rock should remain healthy through Q3.\\nNP/NPKS\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: NPK imports down January-May\\nJapan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.\\nThe country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.\\nSE Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season\\nSoutheast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.\\nIn Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with prices in the other markets closer to the upper end of the SE Asian range, nearer $415/mt CFR.\\nThailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russia and 124,000 mt from Yara.\\nImports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt a year previously. During May this year, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Although a marginal increase had not been ruled out, few expected an increase of this magnitude particularly as the Indian phosphate industry remains constrained by cashflow issues arising from outstanding subsidy payments, the MRP limitations and an unchanged urea price.\\nOn the upside though and the argument used to push through this increase is the fall in ammonia prices. Even with a lower ammonia cost, the higher acid price can be supported by the Indian industry only if the ammonia price falls to a level below $440/mt CFR and the INR does not weaken further. As such the cost position for the industry remains vulnerable and producers are therefore not expected to suddenly ramp up production as these variable factors could turn against them at any time.\\nNevertheless, production will be maintained at a reasonable level through Q2 as the industry prepares for the Kharif but imported DAP will remain the preferred choice. However there is now concern that suppliers will start indicating higher DAP prices to move further in line with the latest acid price hike. A price of $500/mt CFR is being speculated for Saudi product with Chinese not far behind. Currently the breakeven point for importers is nearer $490/mt CFR with recent sales being concluded in the range of $480-488/mt CFR to ensure at least a minimal margin. An increase in price to $500/mt CFR would necessitate an increase in the farm-gate price or MRP to over INR 24,000/mt, not a move that the farmers, producers or government will undertake lightly if at all.\\nWith India currently offering the best netbacks of the three major markets, India, Brazil and the US, Chinese producers are focussing their efforts on Asia over the Americas for new business for DAP and MAP 11-52-0. For the lesser grades, prices are more fluid as there are fewer export alternatives and they find some common ground for the Brazilian market.\\nOn paper Mosaic and PotashCorp might be better off selling for export than in the US market. Export values to Central America equate to the mid-$420s/st at New Orleans. If India has to pay up to $500/mt CFR for DAP, then the return to Tampa would be $15/st more than than the high end of this week\\'s New Orleans market of $415/st FOB.\\nBrazil is buying but progress is more slow and steady. Buyers yet again are achieving the best prices without allowing any unchecked import frenzy to drive prices up. As such the price range remains largely unchanged.\\nHighlights of the Week\\nOCP achieves $40/mt P2O5 increase in H1 Indian contracts Russian DAP sold in India in the low $480s/mt CFR\\nUS barges fall close to $400/st FOB, but seller resistance emerging, export trade equates to mid $420/st in domestic market.\\n$10-12/mt increase in phosphate rock prices expected on the back of acid price\\nAmmonia parcel purchased in India below $440/mt CFR but will it stay there?\\nShort Term Outlook\\nPHOSPHATES | 3\\nWhereas many expect higher prices to be quoted in India over the coming weeks, in line with the higher phosacid price, the tone in Europe and the Americas remains decidedly weak. Will the two regions come back into balance or will the trend be reversed as it was last year when prices west of Suez were markedly stronger than their Indian counterparts. This year India has got off to a more bullish start, supported by low stocks while Brazil in particular has held back, a little more cautious in the face of lower crop prices.\\nThere are two questions which will determine the outlook for Q2. The first is whether Brazilian demand will take off sufficiently over the next few weeks to absorb all the long positions building up in the market and secondly whether Indian demand is strong enough to withstand a hike in the MRP to INR 24,000/mt or more while urea prices remain unchanged.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nDAP\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nUS GULF\\nMosaic sells to Central America,\\nTampa inches down\\nMosaic reported selling another April cargo destined for Central America this week. The producer will load 17,000 mt of DAP/MAP for the customer at $470-475/mt FOB. Rumours have emerged of more business by the producer to Central America, believed to be at a similar price or based on an index.\\nThere is speculation that Mosaic will begin exports to at least its own system in India this summer. Sales to Indian importers are not likely in the near term, as company sources insist Mosaic does not have tons to spare for that much business.\\nMeanwhile, demand in the South has been sufficient for truck sales to continue from Mosaic\\'s Central Florida plants at $440-445/st FOB.\\nUS MIDWEST\\nDAP holding ground in US Midwest as application season nears\\nRetailers and distributors report some DAP postings remain around $470/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River. Resupply is available through Iowa and the Twin Cities in Minnesota by barge, and lower replacement costs out of the US Gulf could weigh down the inland truck market in coming weeks.\\nPHOSPHATES | 4\\nUS NOLA\\nSlide turns to collapse before DAP finds support at New Orleans\\nPrompt DAP barge demand has gone cold, as paper indications through the FIS cash-swap service moved to $390-398/st FOB New Orleans for May-June this week. As a result, a DAP barge changed hands at just $405/st FOB New Orleans before sellers dug in their heels.\\nSubsequent nearby DAP trades were reported from multiple players at $415/st FOB, while offers reached $420/st FOB late in the week. However, buyers had not accepted that price tag at press time. While most of the DAP trades were reported as domestic product, available MAP is dominated by imported material. Indications for\\nimported MAP are roughly in line with DAP.\\nLast week quotes for prompt and all-April DAP barges were $421- 435/st FOB New Orleans.\\nUS SOUTHERN PLAINS\\nDAP applications wait for rain to end in South\\nRain has continued throughout the week in much of the US marketplace in the South, keeping farmers from starting phosphate and other fertilizer applications for spring crops. It may take another week for many of the key growing areas to dry out sufficiently to support field work. This has reduced expectations for corn acres in the region, with farmers considering other crops. In the meantime, DAP price quotes are unchanged from last week.\\nARGENTINA\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nwhile Saudi and South American product are said to be on offer into Argentina at nearer $490/mt CFR. Based on recent price indications for Chinese MAP 11-52-0, a price of $480/mt CFR would not be workable and would necessitate a sizeable drop in FOB values.\\nBRAZIL\\nBuyers playing a measured game, avoiding price surge\\nImport activity in Brazil is picking up but there has been no surge in buying and nor is there likely to be in the near future.\\nBuyers pick off what they need from the continuous stream of vessels offering tonnes from a wide variety of origins. This measured approach to the import season has meant that prices remain largely unchanged from last week, still in the range of $475-485/mt CFR, with some suggesting even lower numbers at $470/mt CFR and others quite clear that the market is well into the $480s/mt CFR.\\nKoch is said to have a PhosAgro DAP/MAP cargo for April loading, which currently is expected to find its way to Brazil although a number of potential destinations have been mentioned. Nitron has a March cargo loading in Saudi Arabia and Indagro has been linked with a South African MAP cargo. Eurochem tonnes are on offer and OCP will load its three MAP/DAP cargos this month and supply both Herringer and its own system without yet coming out with a firm price.\\nMosaic has not indicated a new price for Brazil but its latest spot deal in Central America is another $5/mt lower than last week suggesting that the gap between US and Brazilian prifce ideas is getting smaller. With a FOB price at $470/mt, a landed price into Brazil for US product would equate to the upper $480s/mt CFR.\\nThe lack of buying frenzy has resulted in buyers enjoying some of the lowest netbacks across the globe. India currently presents a far more attractive option for Chinese and Saudi suppliers and even Russian DAP is now being diverted there rather than the Americas.\\nFor 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 there are fewer viable alternatives. Buyers are bidding $380/mt CFR for 11-44-0 which is currently on offer at $360-365/mt FOB China. With freights in the low $20s and a trader\\'s margin, the gap between buyers and sellers is around $10-\\n12/mt. Offers of 10-50-0 have been made in the $440s/mt CFR.\\nBuyers retreat for now but will be back again for H2 April\\nAfter the recent flurry of purchasing, most importers in Argentina are now covered through H1 April for DAP/MAP requirements and can take some breathing space before returning for H2 April shipment.\\nRecent sales include a DAP/MAP cargo for April shipment with open origin, potentially Mexican or Russian, with most priced in the upper $480s but a small parcel has also been sold at around $490/mt CFR.\\nChinese MAP has been offered in the low $480s/mt CFR\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nIndia and Far East attract Russian DAP, NPKs\\nThe sale into India of a panamax cargo of DAP suggests a netback below $460/mt FOB Baltic for PhosAgro given a freight in the low $20s and allowing for some trader margin. Potential sales into the Americas would give a netback at even lower levels, especially given prevailing barge values at NOLA.\\nPHOSPHATES | 5\\nIn Europe the price remains weak to stable with official prices at Terneuzen at $545 but reports of sales concluded at lower levels. Renewed strength in the euro this week has brought some relief to buyers and in Germany, where the season has not yet ended, there are signs of some tentative recovery in demand. This will be of benefit to Eurochem\\'s Lithuanian duty free DAP rather than Russian which is finding its way to other non-European destinations.\\nPhosAgro DAP has been reported on offer in Vietnam this week also but at too high a price to attract any serious interest. Koch is said to be taking an April PhosAgro cargo to Brazil although the destination may yet not be set in stone.\\nWith OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant next month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa. As such it is possible that we will see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian DAP and NPK market, a market\\nthat Russian producers have foregone in the last two years, preferring to develop new NPK markets elsewhere, but which may start to look more attractive in 2015.\\nEUROPE\\nSpring season over in south; tentative improvement in north\\nThe market south of Germany is all but over. In Italy the season is long over and tonnes lie unsold, brought in during February from North Africa and Lithuania and finding little buying interest with the weak euro and lack of demand. Even with lower prices being indicated in recent weeks, nearer $510-515/mt FOB North Africa and $520/mt CFR duty paid for Lithuanian, little interest has been shown.\\nIn France the season has ended early after an exceptionally poor last few weeks, due to higher prices and weak currency. No further DAP imports are expected.\\nOnly in northern Europe, namely Germany, is there any real interest and even here it is limited. The season will continue through to mid April with corn application traditionally starting on April 20. There are signs that the slightly stronger euro this week has prompted a little more interest in DAP. Official prices at Terneuezen remain at $545/mt FCA but a more realistic price range is $535-545/mt FCA.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nTURKEY\\nNegotiations ongoing for Tunisia DAP supply to Turkey\\nNegotiations are underway between Gubretas and GCT for this year\\'s annual phosphate supply contract. Prior to the troubles in 2011, GCT would ship more than 300,000 mt DAP into Turkey per year. Since then, annual volumes have been significantly lower. In 2014 just 90,000 mt DAP was imported into Turkey from Tunisia along with 11,000 mt MAP and 41,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSAUDI ARABIA\\nAmmonia plant down again but DAP production to continue\\nMa\\'aden shut its ammonia plant at the Raz al Khair complex for unscheduled maintenance, estimated to last about 10 days.

The other three technical offers were submitted by Ameropa, Aries/Kailin and Transmart.\\nIndia remains the market of choice for Chinese DAP\\nAll eyes are on China to see whether DAP producers raise their prices to India on the back of the increase in phosacid prices achieved this week. Some speculate that the hike in acid prices will necessitate an increase in the MRP which in turn will prompt suppliers to take advantage of this and raise prices to over $490/mt CFR.\\nIn the meantime more sales to India in the low $480s/mt CFR have been reported this week, giving a netback in the mid-high $460s/$470/mt FOB range depending on size of cargo.\\nIndiacations for 11-52-0 and DAP for Latin America are far less attrractive with potential netbacks in the $450s/mt FOB China. As such Chinese suppliers will continue to target DAP sales to India over 11-52-0 sales into the Americas.\\nPrices have declined for granular 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 due to the lack of better sales opportunities outside Latin America. Recent price indications for 10-50-0 have been around the $415/mt FOB level while 11-44-0 is in the range of $360-365/mt FOB for April loading.\\nFebruary DAP output down again, 37% rise in NP/NPKs\\nThe latest FAI data show February DAP production at 320,000 mt which, although well above the average monthly output for the year, remained below the volume produced in both January this year and February last year.\\nTotal DAP production therefore for April-February was 3.08 million mt, some 7% below 2013/14 and 12% below the average for the previous 5 years.\\nBy contrast, NP/NPK production in February totalled 620,000 mt, more than 35% higher than the 470,000 mt produced in February 2014 but less than in January this year.\\nOverall NP/NPK production for the year to date has reached 7.3 million mt, some 12% above the same period last year but remaining in line with the 5 year average.\\nProduction of all the major NP and NPK grades increased both in February and over the year to date when compared with 2013/14. Production of 20-20-0 went up by 12% to reach 2.76 million mt by the end of February while production of 12-32-16 and 10-26-26 went up by 42% and 14% respectively.\\nImport data for DAP show the overall total for the fertilizer year to date at 3.72 million mt, up by 460,000 mt compared with 2013/14.\\nSales of DAP during February were in line with February last year, at 358,000 mt but the overall total for April-February has been reported at a higher volume of 6.76 million mt compared with 6.17 million mt last year.\\nSales of complex\\nfertilizers, excluding DAP, were also reported higher by the FAI this year at 6.6 million mt at the end of February, up from 6.4 million mt in 2013/14.\\nFAI stock data show closing stocks of DAP at 365,000 mt at the end of February, an increase on the previous two months but still below last year\\'s level of 745,000 mt. By contrast, stocks of NP/NPKs, as measured by the FAI, are reported at 770,000 mt, up from previous months and also up on last year\\'s stock level of 632,000 mt at the same time of year.\\nA delegation of Chinese producers met in India with officials to discuss the current FCO regulations with regard to the specifications of imported DAP. Currently imported DAP is only eligible for a subsidy if it meets the FCO requirements of 18-46-\\n0.The N content can be slightly less but can not go below 17.5% or the product will not be eligible for the DAP subsidy. Instead it would have to be either re-exported or used as a raw material in the manufacture of other phosphate products. The level of water solubility has also been under discussion.\\nAround 800,000 mt DAP already booked for India\\nClose to 800,000 mt DAP have been booked for shipment to India for the coming fertilizer year. Not all the cargoes have been priced but discussions are ongoing to finalise these sales.\\nOne interesting development has been the sale of Russian DAP through Rare Earth to IFFCO for April shipment (see table below for details). This follows the sale of a small parcel of Russian DAP from PhosAgro in combination with 10-26-26 sold earlier to IPL. These DAP sales mark the first Russian DAP sold into India since 2012.\\nOther new sales that have come to light this week include a 45,000 mt cargo purchased by MCFL from Aries/Kailin for April shipment with 10,000 mt AS, at a price in line with recent sales, i.e in the low $480s/mt CFR. Chambal/Zuari will share a 70,000 mt cargo from Aries/Kailin and this has also been priced at a similar level. Chambal will take further cargoes from YUC against its MoU for 500,000 mt but as yet a price has not been confirmed.\\nKRIBHCO has confirmed that it has booked 40,000 mt DAP from Ma\\'aden for April shipment against its MoU for 250,000 mt. Ma\\'aden has indicated a price of $490/mt CFR but the final price has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe $40/mt P2O5 hike in the phosphoric acid price will push the Indian market further towards the import market for DAP given the widening disparity in price between imported and indigenous product based on imported phosphoric acid. With few expecting any significant increase in domestic DAP prices, given that urea prices are to remain unchanged for 2015/16, the industry may continue to produce higher analysis P2O5 products at lower levels through Q2 compared with previous years.\\nWhat could prompt a switch back towards a higher domestic DAP output could be a further decrease in ammonia prices. In the meantime, the industry is likely to continue favouring imported DAP as long as suppliers do not use the hike in acid prices as an excuse to hike their price ideas for DAP, already an area of concern to the market.\\nIndia: DAP Purchases 2015 – estimated to date\\nPHOSPHATES | 7\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nRecent NPK purchases include the following:\\nDeepak bought 40,000 mt 10-26-26 ex Phosagro for March shipment.\\nIPL bought 50-60,000 mt 16-16-16 ex Acron for March shipment\\nIPL has bought a cargo of Russian 10-26-26 from Phosagro for April shipment which will also include some quantities of DAP.\\nThe 10-26-26 cargoes are heard priced around $440 CFR.\\nNEPAL\\nAICL issues tender for 20,000 mt\\nDAP\\nAICL has floated a tender for the purchase of 20,000 mt DAP plus 35,000 mt urea in 50 kilo bags, closing May 7 at\\n13:00hrs Kathmandu time.

The higher acid price agreed in India for Q2 will filter through to production costs and eventually prices in Pakistan with Fauji\\'s acid coming from its joint venture with OCP in Morocco. Currently domestic prices are depressed, being the off-season, and some PKR 80-90/50kg bag below costs.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChinese DAP/MAP exports in Jan/Feb exceed 800,000 mt\\nThe latest GTIS data show that the removal of the seasonal export tariffs has prompted increased export activity this year with 827,000 mt DAP/MAP passing through customs in January/February.

Bangladesh and India took 65,000 mt each in February with a further 50,000 mt reported as loading for the US. At least one cargo of DAP that was originally destined for the US earlier this year was subsequently diverted to India but it is not yet confirmed whether this has been reflected in the GTIS data. Indian DAP shipments for January/February from China totalled 130,000 mt.\\nFebruary MAP exports reached 219,000 mt with the 119,000 mt loading for Brazil together with 52,000 mt reported for the US and 20,000 mt for Argentina.\\nIn addition to the traditional MAP grades loading for Brazil, China also loaded a further 113,000 mt NPs in January/February, with more than 80,000 mt in February alone and including 33,000 mt for Brazil.

JPMC started annual maintenance at its Aqaba complex on March 15 and will be fully shut down, including granulation lines, for 3-4 weeks.\\nMOROCCO\\nOCP achieves $40/mt P2O5 increase in H1 Indian phosacid price\\nOCP has achieved a $40/mt P2O5 increase in the Indian phosphoric acid price for H1 2015, January-June, compared with the price of $765/mt P2O5 in H2 2014. This increases the low end of the FOB Morocco price range accordingly.\\nThe justification for pushing through such an increase is said to be due to the weaker ammonia price and the expectation that it will weaken further in India to enable Indian DAP producers to afford the higher phosacid price. If lower ammonia prices are achieved in India, OCP will step up its acid shipments once again after the relatively low quantities shipped in Q1of just 1-2 cargoes per month to its joint venture partners, PPL, Zuari and TCL.\\nThe rationale for the increase is also to drive through a corresponding increase in the phosphate rock price. A number of rock contracts are based on the Indian phosacid price and as such we can expect to see an increase of between $10-12/mt sought for these Q2 rock contracts.\\nPHOSPHATES | 9\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBANGLADESH\\nNo award yet in BCIC\\'s latest phosacid tender\\nNo award has yet been made against BCIC\\'s tender of March 19 for 30,000 mt phosphoric acid solution for use at BCIC\\'s DAP plant at Chittagong.

Producers in turn will attempt to push down sulphur prices but even with higher rock costs and a stable sulphur price, the production of indigenous DAP through the phosphate rock route remains a more attractive option to that of using imported phosacid.\\nThe current price for imported DAP is still in the low $480s/mt CFR for Chinese product, giving importers a margin of around 1-2%. The equivalent price for imported DAP based on the latest acid price, and ammonia at an average of $440/mt CFR, is close to $500/mt\\nCFR. With ammonia back up at $480/mt CFR or more, the equivalent DAP price for producers importing phosacid would be over $510/mt CFR.\\nMadras Fertilizers Ltd. issued a tender for 10,000 mt solution, closing on April 6 for May delivery.\\nINDIA\\nDAP producers\\' profitablility depends on lower ammonia costs\\nThe new H1 phosphoric acid price has been confirmed at $805/mt P2O5 CFR with 30 days credit, as reported earlier in the week by Fertilizer Week. This represents an increase of $40/mt P2O5 on the price agreed for H2 2014 of $765/mt CFR with 30 days credit.\\nThis new price covers both Q1 and Q2 2015, eg January-\\nJune. Negotiations will take place in July for a new Q3 contract price.\\nA price of $805/mt P2O5 CFR at the current subsidy rate, ammonia price of $480/mt CFR and exchange rate, equates to an estimated farm-gate price for DAP of INR 24,500/mt. The MRP for most suppliers is currently around INR 23,400-INR 23,500. As urea prices remain unchanged, few will want to push DAP\\nprices much higher and will be extremely reluctant to increase them above the INR 24,000/mt level. Government approval is still needed to ensure prices are maintained at a \"reasonable level\".\\nHowever, the ammonia price has become the most significant factor in this negotiation. Taking a theoretical average ammonia price of $440/mt CFR, the estimated cost of producing DAP using imported phosacid comes down to just under INR 24,000/mt.\\nNevertheless, to make this workable for the industry, this would necessitate an increase in the MRP to a minimum of INR 24,000 plus ammonia prices to settle at this level or lower through Q2. There are reports of a purchase as low as $430/mt CFR but it remains to be seen whether this marks a sustained decline or whether prices from the Middle East will settle at a higher level over the coming weeks.\\nWith the rupee still looking vulnerable, the industry may prefer to maintain a more conservative level of production through Q2 and make up any shortfall through imports. With ammonia looking cheaper at the moment though, and the likelihood of an increase in potash prices, production of a product such as 20-20-0 begins to look the most attractive.\\nStill, for those producers using phosphate rock and sulphur, a corresponding increase in rock prices is expected to follow\\nPhosphate Rock\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEGYPT\\nEgypt poised to export first high- grade rock\\nEgypt is poised to become an exporter of higher grade rock for the first time in its history.\\nIn October, Fertilizer Week reported that Misr Phosphate was awarded a licence by the Egyptian government to operate the Red Sea Mine.

Although exact quantities have not been released, the deal is believed to be for more than 700,000 mt at the new contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nThe agreement brings total contracted Indian potash volumes so far to 3.5-3.7 million mt, including some optional tonnage, compared to a total of 3.9 million mt last year. ICL and K+S is still to agree volumes (roughly 700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), but ICL is unlikely to sign a deal to India unless ongoing strikes at its Dead Sea Works operations can be brought to an end.\\nPhosAgro also signed a three-year NPK supply deal to IPL during IFA for 1.35 million mt after a nearly two-year absence. The deal may lead to a slowdown in the domestic NPK production increases which have recently helped boost Indian demand for potash but with most potash contracts already signed to India, overall Indian potash imports are expected to increase to 4.4-4.8 million mt in the current fertilizer year from 4.2 million mt last year.\\nThe increase in Indian demand runs parallel to a recent volume increase in Chinese contracts (6.1 million mt) and Chinese imports data, which shows an 18% increase in potash deliveries between January and April to 2.4 million mt. While demand is expected to fall in some global markets like Brazil during 2015, it is unlikely that deliveries will fall as far as some are expecting, still total demand should be in the range of 58-60.4 million mt in 2015.\\nPrices in the global spot markets have been significantly weaker than suppliers had targeted so far in 2015. This week, US prices have continued their downward trend with key planting largely completed in the Midwest and demand dropping across the buying regions. Prices in the US south have fallen to as low as $380/st FOB while NOLA barge prices cannot be seen higher than $325/st FOB.\\nIn Southeast Asia, prices are largely the same but Malaysian sMOP quotes have lowered to $310-315/mt CFR with current larger tenders unlikely to push up prices in the near term. The price range across the region is seen at $310- 350/mt CFR with the upper end of deals only seen in the smaller markets like The Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\\nIn Europe prices are also flat with potash buying out of season. Granular potash is quoted at €305-315/mt CIF with most quotes at €310/mt CIF, while standard quotes are seen at the very weak level of €270-280/mt CIF.\\nMost suppliers at IFA were highlighting the Brazilian market as their opportunity to boost spot prices in 2015 after the lacklustre start to 2015. The major suppliers have set their June and July delivery prices at $340-345/mt CFR and hope that they can further increase prices through until October. If some of these gains can be achieved in Brazil over the coming months it will likely have a knock on effect in the other spot markets by the end of the year but spot prices are unlikely to reach the levels they ended 2014.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙BPC signs Indian quantities above 700,000 mt with IPL and 3 others\\n∙Total Indian volumes now seen at 3.5-3.7 million mt\\n∙BPC wins RCF tender for up to 265,000 mt MOP\\n∙Suppliers target $340-345/mt in Brazil for June/July deliveries\\n∙US prices fall further, US NOLA $325/st FOB and US South $380/st FOB\\n∙Southeast Asian potash prices dip slightly, $310-350/mt CFR vs $315-350/mt CFR\\n∙PhosAgro signs three-year Indian NPK supply deal for 1,35 million mt\\n∙Europe out of season, prices flat at €305-315/mt CIF\\n∙Chinese domestic prices flat at RMB2,030-2,130/mt FCA\\n∙Canpotex agrees to supply up to $60 m worth of potash to Bangladesh\\n∙China MOP imports up 18% Jan-Apr to 2.4 million mt\\n∙BPC postpones maintenance plans for RU-2 and RU-3\\n∙Europe SOP prices increase, €460-500/mt FCA vs €450-470/mt FCA\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S Plains: Truck values flat despite resupply problem\\nGranular potash truck values have not gained, despite the lack of resupply available from the barge market due to regional flooding. Quotes for potash from terminals along the Arkansas River remain around $380/st FOB, but distributors report retailers already have sufficient tons in hand to meet their remaining seasonal commitments.\\nUS NOLA: Little demand remains for potash\\nModest demand remains for granular potash, and it appears further price cuts from the current price tag of $325/st FOB New Orleans will do little if anything to boost demand at this stage of the season.\\nUS buyers expect BPC will participate in the import market over the summer, perhaps shipping as much as 200,000 mt to the US. However, no deals are believed settled with potential importers at press time.\\nUS Midwest: Potash needs met for season\\nGranular potash demand from retailers is down substantially, as corn and soybean planting is largely completed across the region.\\nFarmers generally are concerned with secondary nitrogen applications at this stage, and there is little enthusiasm for potential fill offers from Canadian producers in coming weeks.\\nDistributors suggest a discount of $20/st from recent retail values in the $380s/st FOB Midwest would might be needed to drive summer fill sales. However, with only moderate amounts of offshore potash likely to arrive over the summer, domestic producers may not have to give that much ground.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Suppliers target $340-345/mt CFR in Brazil\\nBrazil is now seen as the key region for increasing potash spot prices after a weak H1, with US and European markets largely out of season and the Southeast Asian market likely to see little change from their current weak levels until autumn.\\nPrices are currently seen at $330-340/mt CFR with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. BPC and SQM are currently looking for $340/mt CFR for June/July deliveries and Uralkali have priced July deliveries at $345/mt CFR. Canpotex is believed to also be pricing in the $340-345/mt CFR range for June/July deliveries.\\nWith Q1 Brazilian potash imports very low, buyers are expected to pick up high levels of volumes in the next few months in order to limit delays at port during September and October.\\nSuppliers plan to take a staged approach to price increases and if $340-345/mt levels can be maintained for July deliveries then suppliers will likely try to push for $350-370/mt levels before the end of the Brazilian season. However, the $380/mt CFR price achieved by October 2014 is unlikely to be reached before the end of 2015.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Belaruskali postpones maintenance plans\\nBelaruskali postponed planned maintenance at RU-2 at the end of May and at RU-3 at the start of June.\\nThe company made the decision to continue its current high rate of shipments to China and the forthcoming deliveries to India under the new contract.\\nIt is unclear when the sites will go down for maintenance, if at all in 2015.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Action slows and prices unchanged\\nThe European potash market has entered its end of season lull with gMOP prices stable at €305-315/mt CIF ($332-344).\\nMost suppliers quote prices around €310/mt CIF after K+S increased its prices to €315/mt CIF earlier in May but note that deals are currently limited.\\nStandard potash prices in Europe are seen at the exceptionally weak level of around €270-280/mt CIF ($294-305) pushing suppliers to focus standard deliveries on other markets. However, some sources indicate possible tightness in standard supply during 2015 with large supplies going to India and China while BPC is said to be producing at as high as 70-80% granular product.\\nTight supply may help the standard European market see some recovery in the coming months.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: BPC agrees Indian potash volumes\\nBelarusian potash exporter BPC has signed its Indian quantity agreements for the current fertilizer year ending March 2016 with both regular BPC buyer IPL and three others but the exact quantity has yet to be announced.\\nIt is believed that the company has agreed to an increase in volumes above the 700,000 mt sent by BPC to India in the previous fertilizer year.\\nThe deal further backs up expectations of an increase in Indian demand during the current fertilizer year despite the $10/mt increase in the current contract price to $332/mt with 180 days credit.\\nThe agreement brings total potash volumes, including some of the optional tonnage, to around 3.5-3.7 million mt. With further optional tonnage also likely to be sent to India, spot deals and tenders through the year, and both ICL and K+S still to sign volumes (700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014’s 4.2 million mt.\\nAccording to Indian vessel data, around 50,000 mt has been booked for arrival in the first two weeks of June and May deliveries totalled only around 200,000 mt as suppliers agreed contracts for the new fertilizer year.\\nBangladesh: Canpotex agrees BADC deal\\nCanpotex is to supply as much as $60 million of potash to Bangladesh in the current fertilizer year.\\nThe deal was signed between the Canadian Commercial Corp on behalf of Canpotex and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and includes $40 million worth of potash and an additional $20 million in optional volumes.\\nThe exact volumes have not been announced but are likely to be similar to the 120,000 mt signed during 2014 for $40 million between Canpotex and BADC, which also included an option worth $20 million for an additional 60,000 mt.\\nIndia: BPC awarded RCF MOP tender\\nBPC has been awarded RCF\\'s tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional MOP, closed on May 7.\\nThe Belarusian producer was awarded the tender at the new Indian contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nMMTC, IPL and Transmart DMCC also made offers at $332/mt CFR with 180 days.\\nDelivery is split into three shipments to India in June for the firm volumes and two shipments in August for the optional tonnes.\\nThe MMTC tender for 145,000 mt, which was expected as cover to offer in the RCF tender, is believed likely to be scrapped.\\nPrice offers on the NFL tender for 50,000 mt which closed on May 10 have yet to be announced but should be released in the next few days.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: MOP imports at high level in 2015\\nVietnam imported 106,505 mt of potash in April, a 24% increase year on year, according to port data, with high levels of imports believed to be continuing through May.\\nNPK production was seen at over 560,000 mt in Q1 2015 and the January-April MOP imports total 365,000, up 23% on 2014. Currently Vietnamese potash prices are quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.\\nChina: Domestic prices flat amid high imports\\nWith the end of spring application season, domestic potash purchasing activity in China has become slow and thin. Most distributors and downstream users adopt hand-to-mouth buying strategies.\\nPrices on the whole remain stable. Despite wholesale prices still ranging from RMB 2,000- 2,130/mt FCA ($323-344/mt) at port, the mainstream prices of 62% K2O white MOP slid again and dealt at RMB 2,100/mt FCA ($339/mt) this week, while the high end still stands at RMB 2,130/mt with small quantities.\\nAs Fertilizer Week estimated, the April imports reached 822,612 tonnes, up by 9.1% on the 747,774 tonnes imported in April 2014. The January-April imports totalled 2.81 million tonnes, up by 18.1% on the 2.38 million tonnes imported during the same period in 2014.\\nBPC is currently the biggest supplier to China, accounting for nearly 30% of total January-April imports. In addition, shipments from Laos seem more consistent since Oct 2014. China imported\\n65,827 tonnes of MOP from Laos in January-April 2015, making the country the 7th largest exporter to China, exceeding Chile and Uzbekistan.\\nSoutheast Asia: Suppliers struggling to push up prices\\nMalaysian potash prices have slipped to as low as $310-315/mt CFR with the current larger tenders unlikely to achieve higher prices in the near term and significant price increases later in the year largely reliant on a price push in Brazil.\\nCurrency depreciation, weak agricultural commodity prices and high competition in the country have forced the Malaysian price below even the new Chinese contract level but suppliers hope they can achieve at least $330/mt CFR levels between September and December when the market builds again.\\nIndonesia is also priced below the $330/mt CFR level with some suppliers quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR.\\nVietnam and Thailand prices are seen at $330-345/mt CFR. High levels of imports are being seen into both countries including recent shipments from Uralkali and BPC.\\nSmall deals to the Philippines continue to be quoted as high as $350/mt CFR for Canpotex volumes. The total range in Southeast Asia is now seen at $310-350/mt CFR.\\nSOP\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: SOP prices increase further in tight market\\nThe European SOP market remains tight and prices have increased to the high level of €460-500/mt FCA from €450-470/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €520/mt FCA.\\nAfter a bumper year in 2014 regarding SOP production in China, some Chinese volumes are managing to make it into the European market for spot deals but not enough has arrived to have any effect on the under supply situation.\\nBetween January and April, China exported 43,275 mt SOP, around 70% of its entire 2015 exports and more than five times than the same period in 2014. Just under half of the exports went straight to the European market.\\nTessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year.\\nK+S may also choose to increase SOP production in Europe towards the end of 2016, replacing some European MOP production with SOP when its major Legacy potash mine in Saskatchewan begins production.\\nNPKS\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP announces Toros deal, African deliveries\\nOCP has also announced an agreement to supply 50-100,000 mt DAP and some NPKs to Toros/Turkey for June-September shipment. Price details have not yet been disclosed.\\nOCP is planning to send 60,000 mt NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria but some 12-24-12 for Benin.\\nThe Moroccan producer is indicating $330/mt FOB for 15-15-15 sales into African markets and $350/mt FOB for sales into Europe. Other NPK suppliers to Europe say that deals are very hard to come by with the market now out of season and prices continue to be quoted at $325-335/mt FOB Baltic.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: PhosAgro agrees three-year Indian NPK deal\\nPhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India during the IFA conference this week.\\nThe deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but is believed to also include DAP.\\nThis deal follows the flurry of shipments (mainly DAP cargoes) sold for March/April shipment by PhosAgro to IPL and IFFCO earlier this year.\\nPhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: NPK imports increase with jump in Russian deliveries\\nChina imported 413,428 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 64% increase on the previous year but lower than the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, China imported 140,000 mt from Russian producers, more than a three-fold increase year on year, after low levels of NPK deliveries during 2014, while Yara also delivered 140,000 mt NPKs.\\nIt was expected that higher domestic NPK production in China would continue to push down imports in 2015 after an 18% fall in imports during 2014 but with some small Chinese NPK plants down in H1 due to environmental concerns and demand remaining strong, international suppliers have increased deliveries.\\nApril saw an increase in NPK volumes to China with140,000 mt imported; the highest April levels since 2007, with Russian producers providing 40% of the April deliveries.\\nSoutheast Asia: NPK prices increase on solid demand\\nVietnam imported 57,188 mt NPKs in April bringing its January-April NPK imports to more than 100,000 mt with Q1 NPK production exceeding 560,000 mt.\\nMay has continued to see shipments into Vietnam and current prices are around $405-410/mt CFR.\\nThe Thailand and Myanmar markets are achieving even higher prices, putting the range at $410-420/mt CFR. As a result Southeast Asian NPK prices have increased by $5-10/mt and are seen in the $405-420/mt CFR range.\\nNEWS\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nUralkali investors tender 11.89% of shares\\nUralkali said investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback, less than it had looked for when the plan was announced.\\nThe deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.\\nUralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.\\nUralkali offered $3.20/share and $16/GDR for as much as a 15.97% stake in the company.\\nThe company said the plan, which will be funded by its existing cash-flow, was intended to help distribute cash to security-holders at a time when giving out dividends would not comply with company policy. It recommended waiving a dividend based on its full-year 2014 numbers. Major owners in Uralkali, Mikhail Prokhorov\\'s Onexim Group and Uralchem, both voted against the payment of an interim dividend in December 2014.\\nUralkali, which had a cash balance of $2.5 billion at the end of 2014, eventually plans to cancel the acquired shares.\\nIn March, Uralkali announced a new strategy for 2015-2020 in the wake of flooding at its 2.3 million mt/year Solikamsk-2 mine. The $4.5 billion investment plan to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years includes construction of a new mine at SK-2.\\nUralkali also recently agreed on a $530 million loan deal with a range of international lenders, Russian business\\' first international loan of 2015.\\nEarlier in May, major shareholder UralChem announced that it would not take part in the share buyback, considering the investment as \\'strategic\\', leaving more opportunity for minority shareholders, including Acron, to get a better return.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The new deal reduces staff at its Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations as part of the company\\'s on-going efficiency plan. Workers have already returned to operations at DSW.\\nIndian buyers are said to be agreeing quantities for the current fertilizer year with ICL now that the strike is over and a volume announcement is expected within the next two weeks from the Israeli producer. Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.\\nThe US spot market has further weakened this week with Agrium believed to be offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB. Overall prices are believed to have fallen to as low as $365/st FOB in the Midwest and offers in the next few months are said to include price protection, indicating that further price falls could be imminent.\\nThe US imported 4.3 million mt of potash between January and April, 24% higher than the same point last year. With Canpotex reducing re-exports through Portland along with higher imports from Uralkali and new material from BPC so far in 2015, the US is proving to be an increasingly competitive market.\\nThe Chinese domestic market is out of season and purchasing activity is slow. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.\\nEurope is also out of season and prices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF while Southeast Asian potash prices are flat at $310-350/mt CFR, but more Malaysian tenders have been awarded at $310-312/mt CFR levels.\\nBPC continued a strong month for deals after announcing that it has been awarded 80% of the volumes (192,000 mt) in a Bangladeshi tender this week. The company agreed an increase in volumes to India during IFA Istanbul and was recently awarded RCF\\'s tender for as much as 265,000 mt, with firm deliveries to be made this month.\\nSuppliers are pinning their hopes on Brazil for the coming months if they want to reverse the weak price levels seen so far in 2015 across most markets. Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases to as high as $345-350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries, before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.\\nAchieving their targets in Brazil should help suppliers recover losses in other key potash markets later in 2015. However, with Brazilian and US spot potash prices currently $40-50/mt lower than those at the end of 2014, the question is whether price discipline amongst suppliers remains strong enough.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙ICL strikes end, DSW returns to operations\\n∙ICL soon to announce Indian volumes agreement\\n∙US Midwest prices fall, $365-370/st FOB v $385-390/st FOB\\n∙US Saskatchewan Spot levels fall, $340-345/st v $375-375/st\\n∙Chinese Port Wholesale prices fall, RMB 2,000-2,100/mt v RMB 2,000-2,130/mt\\n∙EU gMOP prices €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙More Malaysian sMOP tenders awarded at $310-312/mt CFR\\n∙BPC wins 80% of volumes in Bangladeshi 240,000 mt tender at $344/mt CFR\\n∙Brazil gMOP prices flat at $330-340/mt CFR, suppliers begin price push\\n∙US potash imports up 24% Jan-Apr at 4.3 million mt\\n∙Canpotex exports up 17% Jan-Apr at 6.5 million mt\\n∙OCP raises NPK production, Moroccan potash imports up\\n∙QSL Potash produced 1.4 million mt Jan-Apr\\n∙Malaysian potash imports up 50% Jan-Feb, to 274,000 mt\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Potash exports up by 1 million mt\\nCanada exported 1.7 million mt potash in April, a 3.5% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.\\nAs a result, Canada has exported 6.5 million of potash in the year to date, 17% or 1 million mt more than the same period in 2014. Between January and April, 3.5 million mt was sent to the US and 903,000 mt was re- exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nThe country exported 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland.\\nIncluding the exports from Portland, in April Canpotex exported 404,000 mt to Brazil, 222,000 mt to China, 152,000 mt to Indonesia and 67,000 mt to India.\\nBetween January and April, including the exports from Portland, Canpotex exported 856,000 mt to Brazil, 664,000 mt to Indonesia, 575,000 mt to China, 358,000 mt to India and 468,000 mt to Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand combined.\\nUS: April potash imports flat but re-exports down\\nThe US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in April, largely flat year on year, bringing its year-to-date imports to 4.3 million mt, 24% higher than the same point in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nCanadian producers sent 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic. Despite imports being flat in April, re-exports fell 10% adding high competition and excess supply to the US market.\\nThe US also imported 92,772 mt from Uralkali during April, a 44% increase from the Russian producer year-on-year.\\nIn the year-to-date, the US imported 4.3 million mt of potash with 903,000 mt re-exported as part of the Canpotex agreement. 3.5 million mt came from Canada, 378,000 mt from Uralkali, 140,000 mt from BPC and 133,000 mt from ICL.\\nUS NOLA: Barge market anticipated fill market\\nGranular potash barge values fell in prior weeks, effectively anticipating aggressive fill marketing from Canadian and offshore potash suppliers in the US.\\nThe $325/st FOB New Orleans business completed in prior weeks thanks to excessive barge supplies in the Gulf likely figured into suppliers deciding on summer fill values.\\nCanada: Returns to Saskatchewan sellers lower from\\nUS\\nReturns to Saskatchewan potash producers are down substantially since the start of the spring, thanks to recent offers from some producers into the US for fill programs that began this month.\\nAt press time indications for Canadian granular potash were as low as $370/st FOB in the US Midwest, suggesting a return no better than $340/st FOB mine in Saskatchewan. Even these returns may come under pressure if cheaper offers of overseas material already in play force Canadian producers to match up.\\nUS Midwest: Potash fill offers include price protection\\nOffers for granular potash available to Midwest retailers during June-September include price protection, an assurance typically only employed by suppliers when they find their customer base is certain there will be cheaper values in coming months.\\nAgrium is named by market sources as offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB, with price protection through October. Subsequently, a trader offered potash from overseas for June pickup from terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $365/st FOB. Price protection for this offer runs through September.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Potash prices stable ahead of suppliers push\\nBrazilian potash activity is expected to be quite strong through June and July but there have been limited deals this week as buyers return to Brazil from IFA Istanbul last week.\\nSuppliers are confident that with high demand in the coming weeks and price discipline, prices can be pushed up from the weak levels seen so far in 2015 and are banking on Brazilian increases to help push up other spot markets later in the year.\\nPrices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases towards as high as $345- 350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.\\nIn some good news the Brazilian government has announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the harvest support programme. Brazilian delegates at IFA voiced concerns over the availability of credit so the announcement may help ease those worries but depressed demand is likely to remain in Brazil, considering higher interest rates, inflation and low corn prices.\\nColombia: Potash imports at 100,000 mt in Q1\\nColombia imported 100,000 mt of potash in Q1, an 8% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the quarter, Colombia imported 55,000 mt from Canpotex, 25,000 mt from Uralkali and 13,000 mt from K+S.\\nRecent deals from BPC and Uralkali to Colombia are believed to have been made in the mid $340s/mt CFR.\\nColombia imported 486,595 mt of potash in 2014, a 30% increase year on year with Canpotex and Uralkali providing almost 80% of the imports.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Market out of season, prices largely stable\\nThe European market is largely stable this week and out of season. Prices are quoted €300-310/mt CIF to Northwest Europe for granular deals.\\nSome sources continue to highlight tight supply, particularly for standard potash, with most suppliers sending large volumes to China and India under the new contracts.\\nEuropean prices are unlikely to see major changes until the market begins to build again in July.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Potash imports rise as OCP ups NPK production\\nMorocco imported 57,000 mt of potash in Q1 2015, an increase from just 8,000 mt in Q1 2014 as OCP builds up its NPK production, according to GTIS data.\\nThe imports are more than OCP\\'s entire MOP imports in 2013 and already over half of the 109,035 mt of MOP imports in 2014. During the quarter, Morocco imported 26,000 mt from ICL\\'s Spanish operations, 15,000 mt from Uralkali and 14,000 mt from APC.\\nConcurrently, Q1 NPK exports from Morocco jumped to 88,000 mt from just 6,000 mt in Q1 2014 with large volumes delivered to Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Benin. In 2014, OCP exported 313,000 mt NPKs, with more than 75% going to the African markets.\\nThe Moroccan giant recently embarked on a major expansion with hopes of tripling its fertilizer output in 10 years. OCP also plans to increase its overall capacity of NPKs with the first of its new DAP/MAP/NPK plants expected to start commercial production in late June/early July at Jorf Lasfar. The fully integrated plant will have a capacity for 1 million mt DAP/MAP/NPKs.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: ICL soon to announce Indian agreements\\nBuyers in India have been in talks with ICL this week following news that the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations has come to an end.\\nZuari has confirmed that it has already agreed volumes with ICL, along with APC, BPC, Canpotex and Uralkali totalling 700,000 mt. ICL\\'s total list of quantity agreements should be announced in the next week or two and will likely be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.\\nDeepak Fertilisers has confirmed that it agreed to buy 60,000 mt from Uralkali while Chambal bought 100,000 mt from BPC and is currently in the process of buying another 100-120,000 mt, most likely from Uralkali.\\nPotash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.\\nAround 50,000 mt of potash is scheduled for arrival in the next week to India, inlcuding a 33,000 mt shipment from APC to IPL and an 18,000 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.\\nBangladesh: BPC awarded 80% of private tender\\nBPC will deliver 192,000 mt of potash to multiple importers as part of the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture private tender that closed on May 31.\\nBPC won the volumes at an average price of $344/mt with 180 days credit, excluding the price of bags, a spokeswoman for the company told Fertilizer Week.\\nThe MoA received offers from 21 importers representing different international suppliers.\\nThe potash part of the tender is for as much as 240,000 mt and shipment in September, with individual importers able to submit offers for a maximum of 24,000 mt MOP but suppliers not limited in the number of agents they may use.\\nThe 21 importers offered quantities between 10,000 and 24,000 mt and prices between $327.50/mt and $348.50/mt. These prices are quoted on a CFR basis including another $10/mt for bagging and other charges.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: More tenders awarded at lower prices in Malaysia\\nFurther tender awards have been announced in the $310-312/mt CFR level for Malaysia with prices unlikely to see any increases until the market builds back up in August/September.\\nMost of the larger tender awards were made during last week\\'s IFA Istanbul conference and action should be quite slow in the near term in Malaysia.\\nIndonesian potash is believed to be priced below the $325/mt CFR level with some sources quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR. Quotes from the smaller markets such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand are made at $330-350/mt CFR.\\nAs a result, potash prices are currently seen at $310-350/mt CFR across Southeast Asia.\\nChina: QSL on track for 5 million mt production\\nQSL Potash, created by the merger of the two largest subsidiaries of QSL in March, is believed to have produced more than 1.4 million mt of potash between January and the end of April.\\nThe level puts QSL Potash on track to produce 4.5 million mt potash in 2015, allowing the whole group to reach its planned production of 5 million mt this year.\\nThe merged entity was created to improve management, efficiency and help increase production. Together their production levels represented roughly 86% of the 4.3 million mt produced by QSL in 2014.\\nChina: Domestic prices dip further during off-season\\nThe Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow. Port wholesale prices are largely stable with some slight falls at the top end of prices.\\nThe low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.\\nArrivals of seaborne volumes remain at a stable high following recent contract agreements but some sources have suggested that border rail deliveries may be cut back in the coming months.\\nIn Q1, average potash rail deliveries from Russia are believed to have been around 175,000 mt but this rate is said to have fallen to 136,000 mt in April, with the new level expected to remain for May and June.\\nRail side spot prices into northern China are quoted as unchanged despite the recent $10/mt seaborne contract price increase, they remain at $300-305/mt CPT, but Uralkali has been boosted in the last six months by significant falls in the rail tariff to China after a switch to a less-costly route to Zabaikalsk on the border and the weak ruble.\\nJapan: Potash imports at five-year high\\nJapan imported 180,946 mt of potash between January and April, a 7% increase on the same period in 2014 and the highest January-April imports since 2010, according to GTIS.\\nJapan imported 138,000 mt from Canpotex, or 77% of its entire imports, while 20,000 mt was imported from Uralkali. Canpotex concluded its H1 potash contracts for Japan in December 2014 at an average price of over $410/mt CFR depending on grade, an agreement for the second half is likely to be made shortly.\\nWhile Q1 imports were down on 2014, in April Japan imported 68,000 mt or five-times the imports in April 2014.\\nJapan\\'s full-year 2014 imports were 534,365 mt, a 12% year-on-year increase, with 73% of the imports coming from Canpotex.\\nMalaysia: Early 2015 potash imports up 50%\\nMalaysia imported 273,606 mt of potash in January and February, a 50% increase year on year and the highest January-February imports since 2003, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period both Canpotex and Uralkali increased volumes by 8% and 10% respectively but BPC saw the largest increase, sending more than 60,000 mt compared with just 7,000 mt in the same period during 2014. ICL\\'s Spanish operations sent 27,400 mt and APC sent more than 25,000 mt.\\nThe figures confirm high levels of competition in Malaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.\\nMalaysia imported 1.6 million mt potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and\\nits largest on record. The increase is largely due to higher palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower rate due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.\\nSOP\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Archean plans to start SOP exports this month\\nArchean Group\\'s Rann of Kutch Gujarat project began production of SOP in April after a lengthy overrun, the company told Fertilizer Week.\\nThe project, which is set to produce 100,000 mt/year of SOP before ramping up towards as much as 400,000 mt/year, was planned for operation in the second half of 2011.\\nHowever, development of the project has been slow and key environmental approvals were not awarded until earlier this year.\\nArchean plans to sell material to export markets from June onwards and it is targeting sales for Europe and Asia but it is yet to sign any firm agreements over exports.\\nNPKS\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nUkraine: NPK imports at five-year low\\nUkraine\\'s Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.\\nImports from Russia saw the biggest drop, 24%, with Russian producers sending 165,000 mt, around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian producers sent 21,000 mt, 18% less than last year.\\nThe figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy is likely to have shrank by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.\\nIn the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK prices quoted lower this week with limited activity\\nActivity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quote European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.\\nWith high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are for deals from July.\\nIndia\\'s IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs and DAP during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.\\nIt is unclear whether PhosAgro plans to reduce some NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Thailand\\'s NPK imports drop 23%\\nThailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.\\nMalaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports for the same period in 2014. Russian producers sent 22,000 mt and Indonesia sent 13,000 mt.\\nMalaysia exported the same volumes (58,000 mt) NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.\\nPalm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.\\nNEWS\\nFINANCIALS\\nUralkali extends pre-export facility by $100 million\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $100 million increase on its $530 million pre-export finance facility with the Bank of China.\\nThe facility has now increased to $630 million and there is an option to increase the loan amount by another $170 million to a total of $800 million.\\nThe loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.\\nThe interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years. Uralkali plans to use the loan for general corporate purposes, including helping fund its ambitious $4.5 billion expansion plans to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years.\\nThe news comes a week after Uralkali investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback. The deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.\\nUralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.\\nAcron Q1 net income up on weak ruble, efficiency measures\\nRussian fertilizer producer Acron\\'s revenues and net profit increased in the first quarter due to efficiency measures and the weak rouble despite a decrease in sales volumes in its key products.\\nAcron posted a 59% increase in revenues to RUB 27.7 billion ($445 million), due mainly to a collapse in ruble exchange rates at the end of 2014, as well higher year-on-year dollar-denominated prices for complex fertilizers.\\nThe company\\'s net profit increased to RUB 7.1 billion from RUB 1.4 billion in Q1 2014 with Acron saying that its Oleniy Ruchey mine achieved record operating results of 100,000 mt of apatite concentrate during March.\\nOn a dollar basis using Acron\\'s average exchange rate across Q1 2015 and Q1 2014, revenues fell to $444.7 million against $496.3 million, but net profit increased to $113.6 million from $41.1 million.\\nThe company said the output of its key products was 1.6 million mt, down 2% year on year, and its sales of key products fell 4% to 1.5 million mt due to maintenance at its Novgorod-based facility.\\nAcron noted that costs of goods sold increased, mainly due to higher comparative potash prices, which are pegged to the dollar exchange rate. The company also posted an exchange loss of RUB 1.4 billion from the revaluation of its assets, loans and liabilities.\\nPhosAgro boosts Q1 net profits on higher production\\nRussian fertilizer producer PhosAgro increased net profits in its first quarter on a dollar basis to $228 million from $55 million the previous year as production, sales volumes and most prices increased.\\nThe company said total fertilizer production increased 8% year-on-year due to efficiency measures, with its phosphates operations recording a 4% increase in sales volumes to 1.3 million mt. Its nitrates division saw a 3% fall in sales volumes to 412,500 mt.\\nFirst quarter revenues were up 71% on a rouble basis but due to the massive depreciation of the currency against the dollar at the end of 2014, revenues are down on a dollar basis to $808 million from $841 million.\\nThe company said it received higher realised prices on a rouble basis for DAP/MAP and NPK exports during Q1. Average DAP prices in Q1 were $483/mt FOB Tampa, up 2% year on year.\\nOn a rouble basis, revenue from DAP/MAP sales more than doubled and revenue from phosphate rock sales increased 22%, but sales volumes decreased 27% due to higher internal consumption. NPK export sales more than doubled.\\nPhosAgro saw a net loss in Q4 from revaluation of USD and EUR denominated loans but a clean slate in 2015 coupled with higher production has given the company a good start to the year.\\nIn February, PhosAgro commissioned a new phosphate-potash-sulphur fertilizer production line with capacity of 100,000mt/year and the company said it now intends to invest further in expansion of the number of NPK and other fertilizer grades it produces.\\nIn the upcoming summer season PhosAgro expects significant buying activity from India and Brazil and it noted that it now expects India\\'s 2015 DAP imports to reach 5.5-6 million mt in 2015, at least a 2 million mt increase on last year.\\nDuring the IFA conference this week, PhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India.\\nThe deal between PhosAgro and IPL is over a three year period suggesting around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but also including DAP and NPS.\\nPhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.\\nThe company said in a conference call May 29 that individual sales as part of the contract would be made on a spot basis. At today\\'s prices and freights, Indian netbacks on Russian DAP are in the low/mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic, significantly lower than potential netbacks from Brazil at current price levels of $500/mt CFR.\\nDespite the current weak rupee, PhosAgro forecasts significantly higher NPK demand outweighing domestic output in the coming years due to high internal production costs. During 2014, domestic NPK production rose by 13% to 7.8 million mt and so far in 2015, domestic production has risen further.\\nThe new PhosAgro deal could also have an effect on potash demand in India. If domestic NPK production slows due to the imported NPKs then the recent trend of higher potash buying could slow.\\nFREIGHT/SHIPPING\\nK+S begins modifications at Port Moody\\nGerman potash producer K+S and Pacific Coast Terminals Co. have begun modifications to the existing bulk handling facility in Port Moody, Canada, in order for the site to take potash from the Legacy project.\\nK+S Potash Canada is currently on track and on budget to start potash production in late 2016 at the CAD\\n4.1billion Legacy solution mine in Saskatchewan. The company plans to ramp up production to two million mt/year by 2017 before a gradual extension of the annual capacity to 2.86 million mt of potash products.\\nThe handling facility stores and transports potash products arriving by rail and will allow K+S access to its international clients from the Legacy site. Completion of the modifications is planned for late 2016.\\nPEOPLE\\nICL comes to agreement with striking workers\\nAfter three months of strikes at Israeli fertilizer producer ICL\\'s Dead Sea Potash Works and Neot Hovav Bromine operations in Israel, an agreement has been reached and employees will return to work immediately, ICL said in a press release May 29.\\nManagement at ICL have now signed an agreement with Israel\\'s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and unions representing ICL Israel employees. The deal provides a new framework for ICL\\'s restructuring plan and allows for a reduction in the workforce at both production facilities.\\nAccording to the final terms, the labour reduction at ICL Dead Sea Works and ICL Neot Hovav will total 248 employees, 210 of which will be through an early retirement plan.\\nThe strike, which began in mid-February, cost ICL $164 million in lost revenues in Q1 and net income was hit by $76 million. The company said the impact of the strike will be higher in Q2 due to depleted inventories of bromine during the quarter.\\nICL said that while the strike was costly it considers it to have been \\'a worthwhile investment in the future of its plants in Israel\\' and the economic benefits of the strike will \\'significantly exceed its costs\\'.\\nThe company said that DSW facilities have been less competitive in the past few years due to lower potash prices and high labour costs in Israel, while an \\'unfriendly business environment… by the previous Israeli government\\' led to higher taxes and royalties.\\nThe strikes are likely to have cost ICL as much as 1 million mt in production from the Dead Sea Works so far in 2015. The company has managed to make divestments to boost its net income in Q1 and covered some of its lost sales volumes by increasing production at its Spanish and UK operations.\\nThe company also still managed to agree its major Chinese potash contracts for 2015, with buyers agreeing that volumes which ICL fails to provide in the first half of the year due to the strikes can be replaced by extra volumes in the second half of the year.\\nEnding the strike comes just in time for ICL to agree a new contract with its Indian buyers, after Belarusian potash producer BPC agreed its volumes during the IFA Conference this week. Last year ICL agreed roughly\\n700,000 mt in quantities to its Indian customers and the company is likely to have already conducted discussions over new contracts during the conference in anticipation of the end to strikes.\\nDespite it already being nearly two months into the new fertilizer year in India, potash demand is expected to increase in the country and ICL should be able to agree similar quantities to its Indian buyers.\\nTRADE\\nICL may owe Haifa over potash pricing\\nIsraeli fertilizer producer ICL may have to make a provision in its Q2 financial statements to pay as much as $70 million to Haifa over potash pricing in 2012-13, Israeli publication The Marker reported on May 2.\\nThe most recent ruling in on-going arbitration proceedings regarding potash pricing from ICL to Haifa for its NOP requirements has found that settlement over payments between the two parties needs to be made for between 2011 and 2013.\\nAn examiner for the court ruled that a refund should be paid by Haifa to ICL\\'s Dead Sea Works operations for 2011 but that for both 2012 and 2013, Haifa can request returns from ICL to meet a court formula agreement over pricing.\\nIn early 2014, an Israeli court ruled that quarterly sales prices for potash to Haifa would be based on a formula rather than a set price by ICL.\\nICL may now be liable to pay $60-70 million to Haifa, according to The Marker.\\nIn ICL\\'s 2014 financial report it said that the company was unlikely to have to pay significant amounts in respect to 2009-2013 and no provisions were included in the 2014 figures.\\nICL says it is reviewing the court ruling and intends to petition the court against it over the 2012-13 decision. The company also noted that it was is reviewing any provision that may need to be made in its Q2 financial statements.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The price highlights how weak prices have been in the Southeast Asian market so far in 2015 with currency depreciation and low palm oil prices key.\\nStandard potash deals are seen at $300-345/mt CFR across Southeast Asia, with the average level a premium of only $5-10/mt on the current Chinese contract price.\\nIn the US, traders claim that granular potash barges are now available as low as $320/st FOB New Orleans with some importers trying to liquidate positions. Expectations are weak, with some sources predicting even lower values over the summer. Midwest distributors adjusted their offers last week to compete with fill offers available from some US and Canadian suppliers. That $20/st decline brought quotes from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River and inland warehouses from Nebraska to Ohio to $365-370/st FOB, and barge delivered indications to $350/st DEL.\\nWith the European market out of season, there is currently very little activity other than for small volumes of summer fill. Prices remain €300-310/mt CIF for granular potash and around €280/mt CIF for standard potash. The Chinese domestic market is also off-season. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($322-332)/mt FCA but at the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, small quantities are said to have been purchased by small buyers at RMB 2,120 ($342)/mt FCA.\\nSuppliers continue to highlight Brazil as the key region for price improvement and hope that higher prices in Brazil can drive forward recovery in the other potash markets. According to new GTIS data, Brazilian potash imports are down 30% so far this year at 2.3 million mt with all of the major suppliers seeing major falls in deliveries so far this year. Producers expect that seasonal demand will pick up towards autumn and price improvement is near.\\nBrazilian prices currently remain stable at $330-340/mt CFR but suppliers are said to be selling no lower than $335/mt CFR. Producers have set prices at $340-345/mt CFR for July delivery and hope that values could rise to as high as $350-360/mt CFR in the coming months. While most sources do expect some kind of increase, many continue to highlight issues with farmers, particularly regarding credit, which may limit price increases and note that if one supplier slips from price discipline in the coming months then suppliers\\' optimism over prices in Brazil could quickly disappear.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Malaysian tenders awarded as low as $300/mt CFR\\n∙Southeast Asia sMOP prices slip, $300-345/mt CFR vs $310-350/mt CFR\\n∙US NOLA gMOP barge prices down, $320-325/st FOB vs $325/st FOB\\n∙Europe gMOP stable at €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙Brazil gMOP stable at $330-340/mt CFR\\n∙China port wholesale prices up, RMB 2000-2120/mt FCA v RMB 2000-2100/mt\\n∙GTIS Brazilian potash imports 2.3 million mt Jan-May, down 30% yr-on-yr\\n∙GTIS Malaysia potash imports 421,000 mt in Q1, up 41% yr-on-yr\\n∙GTIS SQM exports 360,000 mt Jan-Apr, down 16% yr-on-yr\\n∙SOP SDIC Luobupo set for summer maintenance, end June-end August\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Prompt market adjusts to fill expectations\\nDistributors adjusted their offers last week to compete with fill offers available from some US and Canadian suppliers.\\nThat $20/st decline brought quotes from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River and inland warehouses from Nebraska to Ohio to $365-370/st FOB, and barge delivered indications to $350/st DEL.\\nUS NOLA: Potash barge quotes lower\\nTraders claim granular potash barges now are available as low as $320/st FOB New Orleans, as some importers still are trying to liquidate positions.\\nPrevious quotes at $325/st FOB are profitable assuming they can be resold in the Midwest at $365-370/st FOB, but traders do not expect to see any gains in coming weeks or month in the barge market, and some still predict even lower values over the summer.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Prices firm as deals build for July\\nPrices remain stable in Brazil as June deals at previous price levels continue to enter the market but deals for July delivery are said to have already secured the $340/mt CFR price.\\nPrevious deals from before new price ideas were set at IFA are believed to still be holding down the low-end of gMOP imports at $330/mt CFR but new deals from Canpotex and previous deals from BPC are seen at $340/mt CFR for June delivery. As a result potash prices remain at $330-340/mt CFR but no supplier is believed to currently be selling below $335/mt CFR.\\nUralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC and Canpotex are believed to have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.\\nMost sources expect that the new price levels will stick and could rise to the $350-360/mt CFR level by the end of August but many continue to highlight issues with farmers, particularly regarding credit, which may limit price increases and note that if one supplier slips from price discipline in the coming months then suppliers optimism over prices in Brazil could quickly disappear.\\nBrazil: Imports down 30% on weak demand in 2015\\nBrazil imported 2.3 million mt of potash between January and May, a 30% fall (1 million mt) year on year, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC reduced volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali reduced volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt.\\nIn May, potash imports fell by more than a half to 607,000 mt. Canpotex deliveries fell by almost 60% to 171,000 mt, BPC volumes fell 55% to 161,000 mt, K+S volumes fell 22% to 101,000 mt and Uralkali volumes fell 66% to 90,000 mt.\\nCurrency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.\\nChile: SQM exports fall 16% January-April\\nSQM exported 360,000 mt of potash between January and April 2015, a 16% fall year on year, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the four month period, SQM sent 130,500 mt to Brazil, 54,000 mt to US (double the levels at this time last year to the US), and volumes between 15,000 mt and 30,000 mt to Mexico, Thailand, South Africa and Europe.\\nIn April, SQM exported 98,000 mt of potash, a 24% fall year on year. SQM sent 39,000 mt to Brazil, 29,000 mt to Thailand and 12,000 mt to South Africa during the month.\\nThe company saw a 27% fall in revenues during Q1 2015 to $387.5 million as MOP and SOP sales volumes fell 48% due to delays in shipments. MOP and SOP revenues fell 42% overall to $87.9 million during the period.\\nIn the company\\'s Q1 report, SQM said it expects sales volumes to significantly increase in the rest of 2015 but volumes over the full year will likely be below the 1.6 million mt shipped in 2014.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Little activity as euro improves\\nWith the European market out of season, there is currently very little activity in Europe other than for small volumes of summer filler. Prices remain €300-310/mt CIF for granular potash and around €280/mt CIF for standard potash.\\nThe average granular MOP price in Europe currently translates to $345/mt after recent improvements in the euro price against the dollar. The price is relatively high against current major markets like Brazil and is equal to many of the smaller granular markets worldwide.\\nThe euro has improved against the dollar by 7.2% since mid-March but overall remains down 20% on the same point last year.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Uralkali shipment to arrive this week\\nVessel data from India shows just one vessel carrying almost 30,000 mt of potash from Uralkali for IPL arriving this week. The vessel brings total shipments in June to more than 100,000 mt so far.\\nICL is expected to announce their agreed volumes to India by the end of the month, with some Indian buyers already confirming that agreements have been made. ICL\\'s total volumes should be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.\\nPotash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nPhilippines: Potash imports up 12% in first quarter\\nThe Philippines imported 52,676 mt of potash in Q1, a 12% increase year on year and its largest Q1 imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, the Philippines imported 31,000 mt from Canpotex and 10,000 mt from Chinese storage, most likely from BPC.\\nMost of the quarter\\'s potash imports came during March, with monthly volumes more than double the previous year, at 36,000 mt, including 30,000 mt from Canpotex.\\nSoutheast Asia: Prices slip further across region\\nMalaysian potash is quoted at $300-315/mt CFR this week, with two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt said to have been sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level, the supplier is yet to be confirmed.\\nThe tender season has largely come to an end in Malaysia and buyers were said to be looking for $295/mt CFR levels before agreeing to prices in the two tenders around the $300/mt CFR level.\\nMalaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 16% against the dollar in the last year, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition\\nis abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.\\nIn Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR while Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam is quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals up the upper end and only for very small volumes.\\nAs a result potash prices are currently seen at $300-345/mt CFR across Southeast Asia. In previous years, average Southeast Asian prices see a $40-50/mt premium against the Chinese contract price but at this point the premium remains only around $10/mt.\\nChina: Prices largely stable but imports slow\\nThe Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow but some small quantity deals have edged up the top end of prices in the region.\\nThe low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($322-332)/mt FCA but at the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, small quantities are said to have been purchased by small buyers at RMB 2,120 ($342)/mt FCA.\\nMay potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April. Between 100,000 and 130,000 mt is believed to have been imported by rail and 400-430,000 mt is said to have been imported by sea.\\nMost sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.\\nMalaysia: Q1 potash imports up 41%\\nMalaysia imported 421,000 mt of potash in the first quarter of 2015, a 41% increase on the same period last year, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, Canpotex volumes reduced by 13% to 140,700 mt but Uralkali more than doubled its Malaysian volumes to 93,000 mt and BPC more than tripled its Malaysian volumes to 87,350 mt. APC and ICL also each sent volumes over 30,000 mt with the ICL potash coming from Spain during the strike at ICL\\'s Israeli Dead Sea Works operations.\\nDuring March, potash imports increased 28% to 147,800 mt with Uralkali quadrupling its volumes to 56,400 mt and BPC slightly increasing its volumes to 26,000 mt but Canpotex reduced its March volumes by 41% to 39,800 mt.\\nThe figures confirm high levels of competition in\\nMalaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.\\nAustralia: MOP imports soaring in 2015\\nAustralia imported 162,065 mt of potash between January and April, an 82% increase year on year and the highest Jan-Apr volumes since 2005, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, Australia imported 121,000 mt or 74% of the volumes from Canpotex, along with some volumes from ICL and K+S.\\nIn April, Australia\\'s potash imports fell 4.7% to 21,328 mt, but during Q1 imports more than doubled to 140,737 mt from 67,000 mt in Q1 2014, its highest Q1 MOP volume since 2003.\\nSOP\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: SDIC Luobupo set for summer maintenance\\nChinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and end of August.\\nSome big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.\\nSome large distributors were recently quoted as selling standard SOP from SDIC Luobupo for as low as RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT, which would represent a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC\\'s February 27 pricelist. However, Chinese SOP prices are currently quoted around the RMB 2,900/mt CPT level.\\nThe company is believed to have produced roughly 696,000 mt SOP between January and April 2015, a 7% increase year on year.\\nNPKS\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBrazil: January-May NPK imports down 24%\\nBrazil imported 152,000 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 24% fall year on year, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, both Russian producers and Yara increased volumes to Brazil to 110,700 mt and 28,500 mt respectively but OCP reduced its volumes to Brazil by 79% to 9,400 mt as it focused sales in West Africa mainly.\\nIn May, Brazil imported 24,800 mt of NPKs, a 39% fall year on year. Uralkali increased volumes to 16,200 mt but OCP reduced volumes by 91% compared to May 2014.\\nDuring the five-month period, Brazil exported 215,400 mt of NPKs, a 13% fall with 191,182 mt going to Paraguay.\\nIn the full-year 2014, Brazilian NPK imports increased 33% year on year to 629,000 mt with Russian producers and Yara making up 83% of the volumes.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Philippines Q1 NPK imports at record\\nNPK deals for 16-16-16 are quoted at $400-420/mt CFR across Southeast Asia with the high end of prices seen in Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar.\\nThe Philippines imported 36,251 mt of NPKs in Q1, a 29% increase year on year and its largest Q1 imports on record, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Philippines took 12,000 mt from Vietnamese producers, 8,000 mt from Yara and 8,000 mt from Namhae.\\nNPK exports from the Philippines remain on hold as Philphos does not plan to restart its NPK operations until the second half of this year, at the earliest after damage caused by Cyclone Haiyan in November 2013.\\nMalaysia imported 85,000 mt of NPKs in Q1, a 45% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, the country imported 23,600 mt from Russian producers, 15,300 mt from Belgium and 12,800 mt from Indonesia. The increase was all due to high imports in January and February. March imports fell 7.9% to 27,000 mt, with half of the volumes coming from Belgium and India.\\nNEWS\\nFINANCIALS\\nUralkali again extends loan facility\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $25 million increase on its pre-export facility with major banks, extending the total amount to $655 million with an option to bring the total amount to $800 million.\\nUralkali signed the loan increase with PJSC Rosbank with the new deal coming just a week after it signed a $100 million increase on the facility through the Bank of China.\\nThe loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.\\nThe interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years.

Suppliers had hoped that the $10/mt increase in contract prices in both China and India would help to increase waning prices, particularly in Brazil and the US, but so far this has not been the case.\\nBrazil is where most suppliers have set their sights in order to improve prices. The potash price in the country has fallen by as much as $40-50/mt in the first half of 2015 due mainly to low agricultural commodity prices, weak demand and credit issues amongst farmers.\\nNew credit is set to reach farmers in early July and demand is building towards the autumn season, causing suppliers to plan price rises step by step through the coming months.\\nBrazilian imports improved in May but remain down 25% in the year so far, according to new ANDA data. Brazil imported\\n2.8million mt potash between January and May, a near 1 million mt fall on the previous year, but May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt. Brazilian prices remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries, before moving towards $355/mt CFR in August. Achieving some kind of increase during the third quarter is likely, but Brazil is unlikely to close 2015 at the $380/mt CFR level achieved last year.\\nSoutheast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales. Similarly, some suppliers have increased prices to around $330/mt CFR for both Malaysia and Indonesia, but these levels are yet to be achieved. With currency depreciation, low palm oil prices and good stock levels in Malaysia particularly, achieving the price target will be a difficult task.\\nIn the US, action has largely grinded to a halt with the market out of season. Some potash movement remains for crops other than corn but postings have further reduced to $345-365/st FOB with distributors looking for as low as $350/st FOB. At New Orleans, barges were last seen at $320-325/mt FOB and suppliers say this level supports recent fill offers for the US interior.\\nThe European and Chinese domestic markets also remain out of season with little activity. Granular potash deals remain in the range of €300-310/mt CIF in northwest Europe but suppliers are said to be targeting price increases to around the €315/mt CIF level after discussions with buyers at this week\\'s Prague Conference. In China port wholesale prices remain in the RMB 2,000-2,120/mt FCA range with activity unlikely to build up until nearer the autumn season.\\nICL and K+S are expected to announce their contract deals to India shortly, which, if at similar levels to last year, should bring total firm volumes to around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014\\'s 4.2 million mt.\\nThe $10/mt increase in China and India, along with increased demand to both countries, must now be seen as an achievement for suppliers. It remains to be seen whether significant price increases in Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe can be achieved by the end of the year, but with price discipline less prevalent than in previous years, it is likely to be a difficult task.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙US Midwest gMOP prices fall to $345-365/st FOB\\n∙Southeast Asia sMOP prices flat, $300-345/mt CFR\\n∙US NOLA gMOP barge prices flat, $320-325/st FOB\\n∙Europe gMOP stable at €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙Suppliers target €315/mt CIF gMOP prices in Europe\\n∙Brazil gMOP stable at $330-340/mt CFR\\n∙Brazil May imports up 6.1% to 789,000 mt - ANDA\\n∙China port wholesale prices flat, RMB 2000-2120/mt FCA\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tenders for 28,700 mt of sMOP\\n∙SOP - SDIC Luobupo Jan-May production at 850,000 mt\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat\\nThere are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.\\nUS Midwest: Only marginal demand remains\\nSome potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Imports improve in May but remain down 25% -\\nANDA\\nBrazil imported 2.8 million mt potash between January and May, a 25% fall (930,000 mt) year on year, according to the latest ANDA data.\\nThe majority of the reduction in imports took place between February and April, while in May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt.\\nEarlier this month, GTIS data showed that Brazil imported 2.3 million mt between January and May, a 30% fall.\\nDuring the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC cut volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali curbed volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt, according to GTIS.\\nCurrency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.\\nBrazil: Suppliers await demand build up\\nPrices in Brazil remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at higher levels in the $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries.\\nBPC confirmed that it has reached an agreement for a 60,000 mt delivery at $340/mt CFR in July. Currently there are limited deals as buyers react to the price increases and many made at the upper end of the range are believed to include some kind of rebate.\\nUralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC, ICL and Canpotex have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.\\nBuyers have indicated some level of acceptance for higher prices but with stocks said to be pretty high and with corn prices continuing to fall below cost-of-production levels, worries remain over whether significant price increases in the $15-25/mt CFR level by the end of August can be achieved.\\nSuppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given on July 1 and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may push for an influx of buying in July and August.\\nLatin America: Uralkali agrees three shipments above $340/mt CFR\\nUralkali signed three shipments to Latin American countries outside of Brazil for June delivery at $340- 350/mt CFR levels.\\nA vessel carrying 20,000 mt granular potash is being delivered to Colombia and Guatemala, a shipment of 10,000 mt of granular potash is heading to Uruguay and a shipment of 15,000 mt of gMOP and 5,000 mt of sMOP is set for June delivery in Colombia and Ecuador.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Suppliers look for price push in Europe\\nPotash activity is seasonally slow in Europe and granular potash deals remain in the €300-310/mt CIF NW Europe range with very few deals reported.\\nSuppliers are said to have put forward to buyers possible European price increases during this week\\'s Prague Conference. ICL are said to be selling higher than €310/mt CIF while Uralkali is now looking for €315/mt CIF for granular potash from July 1.\\nIn recent weeks there has been growth regarding standard potash deals from larger buyers with news of possible tightness in the standard market, as Belaruskali produces high levels of granular product and large quantities of standard potash is sent to India and China on new contracts.\\nGenerally standard potash is said to be traded in the €275-285/mt CIF range with deals for larger buyers quoted at the €275/mt CIF level.\\nBelarus: BPC expects flat or higher potash export revenues in 2015\\nBPC expects full year 2015 export revenue to be no worse than last year and possibly better, the company\\'s Director General Elena Kudryavets told RIA Novosti on July 16.\\nThe company increased its exports of potash by 66% in 2014 to 9.5 million mt compared to 2013 as BPC recovered from the break-up of its alliance with Russian producer Uralkali in 2013.\\nThe announcement does not necessarily mean the company plans to export more in 2015 as higher levels of potash have been contracted to China and India by BPC at higher prices than last year. However, reduced spot prices in some markets such as Malaysia and Brazil may mean the company has to export more to achieve higher export revenues.\\nKudryavets said that BPC is currently supplying more than 100 countries, with the majority going to India, China, Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the company also began exporting to the US this year for the first time since 2008.\\nShe added that BPC expects total volume of potash deliveries in 2015 to fall to 59-61 million mt this year.\\nBPC gets its potash from Belaruskali which produced a total of 10.3 million mt of potash in 2015. Belaruskali increased production in Q1 by 9% year on year to 2.6 million mt and has been producing at very high rates during Q2, pushing back planned maintenance at its RU#2 and RU#3 units until later in the year if at all in 2015.\\nWith possible higher exports from BPC and higher potash production necessary for Belaruskali\\'s increasing NPK operations, Belaruskali is likely to surpass the 10.3 million mt it produced in 2014 and may become the largest individual potash producer this year in the wake of the loss of Uralkali\\'s SK-2 mine in November 2014.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Shipments build up on contract deals\\nMore than 150,000 mt potash is scheduled to arrive in India in the next week as volumes from new contracts signed between major suppliers and buyers in India begin to filter into the market.\\nPotash arriving this week comprises seven shipments from Uralkali, APC and BPC. Uralkali sent three cargoes totalling 72,000 mt to Shriram, Zuari and IPL, APC sent two shipments totalling 30,600 mt to Zuari and BPC sent 54,000 mt to Chambal and IPL.\\nThe new volumes bring total June shipments up to 264,070 mt, according to new port data.\\nSome volumes in the RCF tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional potash, which closed on May 7 and was awarded to BPC, are also likely to soon arrive in the country.\\nIn India, BPC recently agreed volumes in excess of the 700,000 mt sent in the previous fertilizer year, Canpotex closed deals for 1.3 million, APC signed 505,000 mt and Uralkali agreed deals for 800,000 mt. There are rumours that K+S signed around 150,000 mt to India, most likely with IPL, which means only ICL is yet to announce its quantities.\\nIf ICL signs volumes around the 700,000 mt it sent last year then the total volumes sent to India should be around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014\\'s 4.2 million mt.\\nSri Lanka: MoA announces potash tender\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture has announced a tender for 28,700 mt of standard potash, closing on 29 June.\\nIn February, the MoA\\'s last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd. with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Prices remain weak as suppliers hold offers\\nSoutheast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales.\\nLast week, two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt were sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level in Malaysia, likely by local traders selling off stocks, and sources say that it\\'s difficult to make any deals above $305/mt CFR currently. Some suppliers are holding prices around $330/mt CFR in Malaysia and hope that price discipline can push up the Malaysian potash price.\\nMalaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition is abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.\\nIn Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR but suppliers are now said to be offering no less than $330/mt CFR, with no deals yet confirmed at that level.\\nThailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals at the upper end and only for very small volumes.\\nChina: Potash activity remains slow with reduced imports\\nThe Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow, with imports reduced so far in June.\\nMainstream standard potash deals have generally been concluded in the RMB 2,020-2,100 ($325-338/mt) FCA range with some small volumes still trading at RMB 2,000/mt FCA. Small quantities of the 62% K2O white MOP are still said to have been purchased at RMB 2,120/mt FCA.\\nJune imports have so far been slow, particularly for rail cross border imports which are estimated to be lower than 100,000 mt this month. May potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April.\\nMost sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.\\nSouth Korea: Potash imports up 70% in May\\nSouth Korea imported 79,000 mt of potash in May, a 70% increase year on year and the highest May imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the month, 76% of the volumes or 60,000 mt came from Canpotex, while South Korea imported 13,000 mt from BPC and around 6,000 mt from Laos\\' producers.\\nBetween January and May, South Korea imported 312,453 mt of potash, a 5.8% increase year on year and the highest potash imports for this period since 2005. During the five-month period, South Korea imported 71% or 222,000 mt from Canpotex, 68,000 mt from BPC and 21,210 mt from Laos (surpassing volumes from Laos for the whole of 2014).\\nSOP\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Two small SOP tenders announced\\nRCF has announced a tender for 2-3,000 mt SOP closing next week on June 22 while IFFCO has announced a tender for 2,000 mt closing at the end of this week, June 19.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: SDIC Luobupo produces strongly ahead of maintenance\\nChinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo produced around 150,000 mt of SOP in May, according to sources, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt.\\nJanuary-April volumes were up 7% year on year at 696,000 mt and product seems to be continuing in this vein.\\nThe company is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and the end of August.\\nSome big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates, with prices seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.\\nThe price represents a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC\\'s February 27 pricelist but some distributors expect the SOP price will strengthen while SDIC is down for maintenance due to the planned decline in output.\\nNPKS\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices\\nThe European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia particularly, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.\\nEuropean NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 deals continue to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.\\nBelarus: NPK exports flat January-April\\nBelarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nBelarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarusian NPKs was suspended in August last year.\\nIn the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.\\nBelaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to roughly 240,000 mt.\\nThe company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.\\nIn 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision\\nNigeria\\'s fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack for clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.\\nThe current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).\\n\"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen,\" Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.\\nNigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.\\nOCP recently said it is planning on sending 60,000 mt of NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria, and indicated $330/mt FOB for sales into the African markets. OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.\\nFertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.\\nNEWS\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nAllana shareholders approve ICL takeover\\nAt a meeting of shareholders this week, Allana Potash Corp has agreed to approve the company\\'s acquisition by Israeli potash producer ICL.\\nAllana Potash\\'s flagship asset is in the Danakhil evaporite basin, part of the Dallol region of the Afar province of Ethiopia.\\nUnder the agreement, most Allana shareholders will receive $0.50 in cash per Allana share while some will receive the equivalent of $0.50 in shares of ICL for each Allana share exchanged.\\nThe takeover was approved by 96% of the votes cast by securityholders and 90% of the company\\'s shareholders who were allowed to take part.\\nICL, which currently holds a 16.36% share in Allana, offered a total of around CAD 137 million ($111 million) for Allana in March, arguing that the takeover would suit its strategy to broaden its sources of raw materials globally while reducing its production costs and focusing on high growth emerging markets.\\nEarlier this year, Allana announced a preliminary economic assessment for the site which showed an after- tax net present value of $1.6 billion based on annual production of one million mt of SOP over an estimated operating life of 77 years. Allana wanted to secure financing for necessary construction by mid-2015 to begin building a mine next year. MOP production was slated begin by 2018 with SOP production the following year.\\nICL plans to accelerate pre-construction engineering work, secure project financing and reduce the company\\'s risks associated with the project.\\nThe takeover deal is expected to close on June 22, subject to certain conditions.\\nPEOPLE\\nMagIndustries reveals evidence of alleged bribery\\nPotash junior MagIndustries has announced the resignation of its auditor and has commenced a delisting review as an internal investigation finds evidence of bribes totalling several thousand dollars were paid by its subsidiaries to Congolese officials.\\nIn January, MagIndustries was prompted to carry out an internal investigation after Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched their offices. The RCMP have not laid yet any charges against MagIndustries\\nThe Toronto-based company said in a news release that there is evidence to show that its wholly-owned subsidiary Eucalyptus Fibre de Congo made four payments totalling as much as $76,500 to inspectors and officials in Congo to reduce EFC\\'s debts and taxes.\\nMagIndustries is still investigating a fifth alleged bribe, which took place in 2013.\\nHowever, due to a lack of funding from its largest shareholder, MagIndustries has had to dissolve the committee investigating the allegations, many of which involved the development of MagIndustries 90% owned Mengo potash mining project in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese government holds the other 10%.\\nMagIndustries said that its controlling shareholder, Evergreen Holding Group, has informed it that it cannot cover the millions of Canadian dollars involved as expenses to continue the investigation but will seek funds to do so.\\nIn the meantime, four directors, including three on the special committee, have resigned from MagIndustries and its chief financial officer has been suspended. In addition, Richey Morrow has been appointed its co- chief executive officer along with current CEO Longbo Chen.\\nErnst & Young has resigned as the auditor for the company effective June 16, concluding that in their professional judgment they cannot complete MagIndustries\\' consolidated financial statements for 2014 in accordance with professional standards.\\n\"Any resumption of the investigation will depend on the appointment of new independent directors and on the controlling shareholder raising sufficient funds to fund such resumption,\" MagIndustries said.\\nThe company also announced that it is reviewing the possibility of delisting from the Toronto Stock Exchange. If the company is unable to demonstrate on or before 17 July that it meets TSX\\'s requirements for continued listing, it will be forced to delist.\\nMagIndustries had been in talks earlier this year with major Chinese potash producer Qinghai Salt Lake over a possible investment by QSL in the Mengo project but with the bribery investigation ongoing, any investment is unlikely at this point.\\nThe company also confirmed in January that a Letter of Commitment from November 2013 made by the China Development Bank for the majority of funding for construction of the Mengo project remains active. The delay in approval of the loan is due to more conservative lending environment and tighter fiscal controls in China, MagIndustries remarked, but finalising the loan remains indefinitely delayed.\\nThe site\\'s potential deposit reserve is estimated at 33.2 million mt of potash, which the company intends to sell into markets in Asia, Europe and South America.\\nPROJECTS\\nSirius Minerals shares hit as planning report sees policy clash\\nNorth York Moors National Park Authority\\'s planning committee for Sirius Minerals\\' York Potash development has highlighted certain problems with the application but have yet to make a decision on whether it should go ahead.\\nThe company\\'s shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 28% on 18 June.\\nThe report says that while there is an economic case for the mine, \"the application has a clear and\\nfundamental conflict with both local and national policies… The greater public interest is considered to be that of the statutory National Park purposes which protect the North York Moors.\"\\nBuilding such a large mine in a national park clashes with current policy guidelines, the report said, and Sirius\\' consultants have underestimated the environmental effects of some details of the plan.\\nHowever, the report also said that there is \"very strong local support\" for the mine, the economic impacts could be of \"national significance\" and that mitigation plans put in place by Sirius \"go a long way towards moderating the impact\" of the mine.\\nSirius disagrees with certain policy interpretations reached by the committee and that the project is in the public interest due to \"the substantial scale of the benefits and extent to which the environmental effects have been mitigated or compensated for,\" the company said.\\n\"Responsibility for balancing the various issues related to this application rests with the members of the Authority and we believe the case for approval is very strong because the Project represents a once in a generation opportunity,\" Chief Executive Chris Fraser said.\\nThe report did not include any recommendation, leaving this up to a special planning committee on June 30. If the special committee cannot come to a decision then the application could be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which could delay the process for as long as nine months.\\nThe decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the MTS in its jurisdiction.\\nAll of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius\\' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.\\nThe company is planning a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.\\nDanakali set for Colluli Definitive Feasibility Study in Q3\\nDanakali Ltd, formerly South Boulder Mines, has submitted the last set of its social and environmental assessments for the Colluli potash project to the Eritrean Ministry of Mines and Energy.\\nThe assessments will be used to develop both social and environmental management plans, which will be submitted after the site\\'s definitive feasibility study is completed, currently estimated to be in Q3 2015.\\nIn May, the company announced a 1.1 billion mt maiden ore reserve estimate at 10% K2O equivalent at Colluli. The estimate was based on a 287 million mt proved ore reserve and an 820 million mt probable ore reserve at the Eritrean site, with over 85% of its measured and indicated resource included in the estimate.\\nThe company said the site is capable of producing SOP, SOP-M and MOP and the reserve could last more than 200 years based on modeled production rates in its recent pre-feasibility study (PFS).\\nIn March, South Boulder announced a PFS for the Colluli project. The study showed that with open pit mining the project would have initial production output of 425,000 mt/year of SOP in 2018, increasing to 850,000 mt/year from year five.\\nPotash West commissions Ercosplan\\nPotash junior Potash West has brought on German consultants and engineers Ercosplan to oversee technical operations in its South Harz project in Thuringia, Central Germany.\\nThe site requires further drilling to upgrade its resource to JORC standards and the consultants believe that a maximum of three drill holes are necessary to upgrade the project\\'s resource.\\nPotash West and Ercosplan are now planning the new drill holes and are carrying our discussions with drilling contractors.\\nThe Kullstedt part of the licence currently holds a large exploration target of 4 to 5 billion mt of potash ore at a grade of between 7 and 25% K2O.\\nEast Exploration Pty Ltd, in which Potash West has a 55% stake, owns the South Harz project.\\nIn May, Potash West said it may sell 100% of the South Harz project to Petratherm Ltd but parties decided not to proceed with the deal. Potash West and East Exploration are now looking at other opportunities to achieve a similar outcome.\\nPhosAgro launches new bulk terminal\\nRussian phosphate producer PhosAgro has now commissioned Smart Bulk Terminal, its new fertilizer terminal at Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland.\\nThe opening ceremony for the new terminal, which has a capacity of over 1.5 million mt of mineral fertilizers/year and 80,000 mt of fertilizer storage space, took place on July 16.\\nThe project is considered unique because handling and storage facilities can be doubled in a short time period and fertilizers are unloaded from railcars at the site onto specialised sea-shipping containers designed for quick loading and unloading.\\nAt present the Smart Bulk Terminal can handle 180 mineral hopper barges/day and can load ships at a rate of 15,000 mt/day.\\n\"Developing our own port terminal capacities enables us to decrease transportation costs and further strengthens PhosAgro\\'s position as the leader on the global cost curve,\" PhosAgro Chief Executive Andrey Guryev said in a company statement.\\nTotal investments in the project amounted to RUB 650 million ($12 million), with funds coming from PhosAgro and Ultramar, Russia\\'s largest provider of container transportation services for fertilizers, in accordance with their 70/30 ownership of Smart Bulk Terminal.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

PotashCorp has yet to respond to the statement but has already informed K+S that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.\\nIn the markets, suppliers price goals for June and July deliveries to Brazil have largely failed, with very few deals signed at $340/mt CFR. Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR, many believe that suppliers will struggle to surpass $350/mt CFR levels by the end of Q3 unless there are significant changes to the market environment.\\nDemand has slowed across many potash markets in a seasonal lull. US NOLA barge deals cannot be seen above $320/st FOB but with BPC now considering holding off from deliveries in Q3 the market may be less oversupplied in the coming months.\\nThe Chinese domestic market is also out of season and standard prices have fallen to RMB 1,980-2,100 ($319-338)/mt FCA.\\nIn Southeast Asia foreign exchange rates continue to hold down potash prices with Malaysian potash deals still seen as low as $300-310/mt CFR. Major suppliers are staying out of the Malaysian market and focus on the other Southeast Asian markets where prices are seen in the $320-340/mt CFR range.\\nDespite weaker potash prices in Brazil, the US and the Chinese domestic market, suppliers are more confident of achieving their new price targets in the European market. As yet, the goal of €315-320/mt CIF gMOP has eluded potash producers but deals cannot be seen lower than €305/mt CIF this week in the European market.\\nIn the UK, Sirius Minerals received approvals from the North York Moors National Park Authority to mine polyhalite in the UK. The company will now look for funding towards the £1.7 billion mine and aims to have a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.\\nReaders should also note that potash indicative prices have been updated this week to take into account new prices and freight levels entering Q3 2015. For most suppliers, the $10/mt contract increases in the Chinese and Indian standard markets have been largely offset by weaker spot prices through H1.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙K+S board rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal\\n∙Sirius Minerals gets approval for £1.7 billion polyhalite mine\\n∙Brazil gMOP price down, $325-340/mt CFR v $330-340/mt CFR\\n∙US NOLA prices down, $320/st FOB v $320-325/st FOB\\n∙China domestic prices down, RMB 1,980-2,100/mt FCA v RMB 2,000-2,100/mt FCA\\n∙Europe gMOP prices up, €305-310/mt CIF v €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙Southeast Asian prices stable at $300-340/mt CFR\\n∙Europe SOP prices up, €470-520/mt FCA v €460-500/mt FCA\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tender offers said to be around the $345/mt CFR with 180 days level\\n∙SDIC Luobupo stops SOP operations for maintenance\\n∙BPC and IPL sign MOU on potash deliveries\\n∙Uralkali Q1 revenues down 17% yr-on-yr at $720 million\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat\\nThe main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.\\nDemand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.\\nUS NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question\\nBPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.\\nThe producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.\\nPreviously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.\\nIn the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: Potash imports continue above average\\nColombia imported 153,900 mt of potash between January and April, an 8% increase year on year, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Colombia imported 72,000 mt from Canpotex, 60,000 mt from Uralkali, 15,000 mt from K+S and 7,000 mt from SQM.\\nIn April, Colombia imported 54,000 mt of potash, a 7% increase, with 35,000 mt from Uralkali and 17,000 mt from Canpotex.\\nUralkali recently confirmed around 15,000 mt of gMOP for delivery to Colombia in the $340s/mt CFR.\\nBrazil: Buyers continue to resist target prices\\nSuppliers have struggled to get their target $340-345/mt CFR prices for July deliveries to Brazil with potash deals seen as low as $325/mt CFR this week.\\nSuppliers had hoped to push up prices by $5-10/mt in each month leading into the autumn season but with high stocks, issues with farmers credit, low agricultural commodity prices and high competition, suppliers have struggled to sell product above $330/mt CFR.\\nMost sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR. There are even unconfirmed deals signed as low as $320/mt CFR, highlighting the significant difficulties in the way of suppliers. With July shipments largely booked, suppliers are unlikely to increase their targets when it comes to August in light of the current market.\\nCanpotex and BPC recently confirmed deals for around 100-150,000 mt of potash at $340/mt CFR but most sources consider these to be outside the range for most potash deals and could include some kind of discount.\\nSuppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given in July and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may lead to increase buying in July and August.\\nHowever, many sources do not expect the new credit to filter into the hands of farmers until August at least and believe that market conditions currently make it unlikely that suppliers will achieve significant\\nprice increases as we move through Q3.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: BPC and IPL sign MoU on potash deliveries\\nBelarusian Potash Company and Indian Potash Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding regular deliveries of potash for five years starting in 2016, Belarusian state news agency BelTA said on June 29.\\n\"The document is further evidence of the close cooperation between Belarus and India. The memorandum implies regular supplies of potash from Belarus to the Indian market from 2016 to 2021,\" BPC\\'s press service told BelTA.\\nIPL is believed to have agreed deliveries of 600,000 mt potash with BPC for the current fertilizer year along with optional agreements for another 100,000 mt.\\nBPC, which generally has a smaller market share in India than Canpotex or Uralkali, said that it expects the deal will strengthen its position in the Indian market and help develop the agriculture industry there.\\nThe news comes as Indian buyer IFFCO also met BPC representatives this week regarding long-term supply deals. IFFCO Managing Director Dr Awasthi said that there had been \"fruitful discussions about long-term supply\".\\nIFFCO currently gets its potash fertilizer needs, believed to be around 500,000 mt a year, through IPL, so the long-term agreement between BPC and IPL may include some volumes destined for IFFCO.\\nIndian contract deals have already confirmed higher demand in this fertilizer year and news of future agreements may help India to combat its imbalance in nutrient application.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Suppliers more confident over price goals in Europe\\nSuppliers continue to target €315-320/mt CIF gMOP prices across Europe with little activity due to a seasonal lull in demand. Currently prices are quoted in the €305-310/mt CIF range.\\nIndications are that European buyers are less against the price increases than in Brazil and that €315/mt CIF levels may have already been achieved in some unconfirmed deals.\\nEuropean potash prices were considered comparatively weak in Q1 as euro exchange rates hit very low levels. Suppliers managed to correct the prices and a slight euro resurgence has meant that gMOP prices are seen as high as $344/mt CFR at current exchange rates.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: Tender offers seen around $345/mt level\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture tender for 28,700 mt of sMOP which closed on June 29 is expected to be awarded in the next few days.\\nOffers came in from a range of suppliers including Uralkali, BPC and APC at prices believed to be above the $345/mt CFR with 180 days credit level.\\nIn February, the MoA\\'s last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.\\nIndia: High imports arriving on new contracts\\nIn the first 10 days of July, 150,000 mt of potash is scheduled to arrive in India as volumes from recently- signed contracts begin to filter into the country.\\nOf the volumes, 63,000 mt are going to Zuari via two BPC shipments and a 36,000 mt shipment from Canpotex. Canpotex is also sending a 31,500 mt shipment to RCF while BPC is sending one 36,750 mt shipment to IPL and one 15,000 mt shipment to TCL.\\nICL recently signed contracts to supply 835,000 mt of potash including options to customers in India between April 2015 and March 2016. The deal meant that current estimates for firm contracts have reached as high\\nas 4.5 million mt compared to 3.9 million mt in the last fertilizer year. Total imports in the 2014/15 fertilizer year reached 4.2 million mt so potash imports in the current fertilizer year are likely reach at least 4.7-4.8 million mt and may be as high as 5 million mt.\\nThe price on the new Indian contracts is $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit, a $10/mt rise on the previous year.\\nInland, dealers and retailers are said to already be full with potash stocks and any slowdown in demand may put pressure on importers for higher discounts on the Maximum Retail Price. According to one source, dealers in the northern regions are offering discounts in the range of INR 1,500-2,000/mt ($24-32) on\\nthe potash MRP with some importers currently at breakeven point for potash.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: Record potash imports continue through May\\nThailand imported 338,765 mt of potash between January and May, 21% higher than the same period in 2014 and the highest ever imports during the five-month period, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Thailand\\'s potash imports from Canpotex were largely flat at 132,000 mt, but imports from BPD increased 20% to 93,500 mt and SQM sent 38,000 mt compared to zero in the same period 2014.\\nIn May, Thailand imported an impressive 100,000 mt with 43,000 mt from Canpotex, 27,000 mt from SQM and 18,000 mt from BPC.\\nThe country is considered highly-competitive market with prices currently quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.\\nJapan: Potash imports slow after strong Q1\\nJapan imported 230,000 mt of potash between January and May, an 11% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nAfter January to April imports reached a five-year high, May imports were down 44% to 49,000 mt, including 25,000 mt from Canpotex, 8,000 mt from Uralkali and 6,500 mt from BPC.\\nThe fall meant that January to May imports were down 11%. During the period, Japan\\'s imports from Canpotex fell 20% to 164,000 mt but imports from Uralkali increased 87% to 27,500 mt and imports from BPC increased 36% to 15,000 mt.\\nCanpotex signed contract agreements to Japan for the first half of 2015 at an average price of more than $410/mt CFR but recent spot deals are believed to have been made at around $350/mt CFR. Canpotex is expected to announce prices for H2 shortly.\\nSoutheast Asia: Forex rates continue to hit potash markets\\nSoutheast Asian standard potash prices continue to be seen this week at $300-340/mt CFR with Malaysian currency depreciation continuing to hold down the low end of potash deals in the region.\\nMalaysian prices are seen around $300-310/mt CFR as slightly higher deals on a ringgit basis are offset by currency depreciation against the dollar. The Malaysian ringgit has weakened 18% against the dollar in the last 12 months.\\nHowever, the deals are said to be very small and major suppliers are staying out of the market until stocks deplete and demand increases. Most suppliers have their prices held at $320/mt CFR and higher for Malaysia.\\nWith the market generally out of season deals are hard to come by in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Prices outside Malaysia remain in the $320-340/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia.\\nChina: Domestic potash prices slip again on reduced demand\\nSlow purchasing activity and reduced demand have caused further price drops in the Chinese domestic potash market.\\nOffers remain stable with mainstream Russian red standard potash trading at RMB 2,000-2,020 ($323- 326)/mt FCA and the low-end of Russian red standard trading as low as RMB 1,980 ($319-320)/mt FCA. The high end of white 62% K2O MOP remains at RMB 2,100 ($338)/mt FCA.\\nQSL prices are seen stable at the levels indicated in its April 15 pricelist. QSL\\'s price for standard crystal MOP is RMB 2,000/mt CPT, with standard powder MOP at RMB 1,960/mt CPT\\nGranular potash deals are seen at just RMB 2,050 ($330)/mt at port, a similar level to the current weak Brazilian and US NOLA prices.\\nMay saw imports fall to 560,000 mt and June imports are also expected at a lower level. At the same time rail imports in May from Uralkali are said to be just 90,000 mt with June and July rail deliveries expected at a similar level.\\nDuring a conference call this week, Uralkali said rail to China has seen a significant decrease so far this year and previous expectations or 1.3 million mt of rail deliveries may not be reached in 2015.\\nSOP\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: SOP prices rise on tight market\\nIncreased demand and tight supply in the European SOP market has again pushed up prices.\\nSOP prices in Northwest Europe are at €470-520/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €550/mt FCA.\\nLast week, Fertilizer Week reported that Chinese SOP producers doubled their year-on-year SOP exports in May bringing year-to-date exports to 54,000 mt compared to 13,700 mt in the same period last year, including 18,000 mt to Belgium.\\nTessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year, easing some of the tight availability.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: SOP imports at high level so far in 2015\\nJapan imported 52,000 mt SOP between January and May, a 36% increase on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, Japan imported 24,000 mt from K+S, 18,000 mt from Taiwanese suppliers, 3,800 mt from Namhae and 3,700 mt from Chinese producers.\\nIn May, Japan\\'s SOP imports doubled to 12,500 mt. During the month, Japan imported 12,500 mt from K+S, 2,500 mt from Taiwanese producers, 2,100 mt from Namhae and 2,100 mt from Chinese producers.\\nChina: SDIC Luobupo stops for maintenance\\nChinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo closed for planned summer maintenance last week and is unlikely to reopen until the end of August.\\nThe company produced around 150,000 mt SOP in May, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt. Chinese SOP prices were last seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT.\\nNPKS\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: NPK imports down January-May\\nJapan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.\\nThe country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.\\nSoutheast Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season\\nSoutheast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.\\nIn Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with other markets making up the higher end of the range.\\nThailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russian producers and 124,000 mt from Yara.\\nImports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt in May 2014. During May, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.\\nNEWS\\nFINANCIALS\\nMigao Corp. see\\'s 20% increase in yearly revenues\\nChinese speciality potash fertilizer producer Migao Corp. said its revenues in the financial year ending March 31 were CAD 444.5 million ($356 million), a 20% increase year on year as higher sales and prices helped the company.\\nAs a result, Migao swung to a gross profit of CAD 47 million in the year compared with a gross loss of CAD 9.6 million in the previous year.\\nThe SOP and NOP producer said that market conditions for SOP were strong throughout 2015 compared with one year ago with higher average selling prices, but that higher sales were offset by decreases of roughly CAD 51 million in its sales of compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride.\\nThe company said that Chinese demand for NOP, compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride were weak through the year but that appreciation of the Chinese Yuan against the Canadian dollar also contributed to the dollar-based revenue increases.\\nIn the quarter ending March 31, revenues were $208.7 million, an 11% fall on the previous year due to lower average selling prices in all products except SOP, couple with lower sales volumes for all products.\\nMigao announced earlier this year that the second phase of its NPK and NOP production line with EuroChem will be launched this year. In total, the joint venture will produce as much as 60,000 mt/year NOP and as much as 200,000 mt/year NPKs in Yunnan by the end of 2015, with both parties having a 50% stake in the deal.\\nUralkali struggles in first quarter as revenues fall 17%\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali\\'s Q1 revenues fell 17% year on year to $720 million due to lower production and reduced sales volumes.\\nThe company\\'s production in Q1 fell 8% to 2.7 million mt following the loss of output from its SK-2 mine after flooding at the end of 2014. Sales volumes during the quarter were at the even-lower level of 2.5 million mt, a 17% fall year on year as subdued demand in key markets hit sales. The company attributed lower demand to currency fluctuations, lower crop prices and farmers using up existing stocks.\\nDespite this, some of the reduction in sales volumes was offset by an increased average export price of $256/mt, up 19% year on year after very low potash prices in Q1 2014 following the break-up of Uralkali\\'s alliance with Belaruskali.\\nThe company said it expected shipments to increase in H2 following a draw-down of inventories and as the autumn application seasons take place, particularly in Brazil where suppliers are targeting price increases in the next few months.\\nUralkali expects potash demand in 2015 to fall to 58-59 million mt from 63 million mt in 2014.\\nThe company said it continued to implement its plan to mitigate the damage following the flooding at SK-2. It is pumping out brine and strengthening the walls between the flooded mine and the nearby Solikamsk-1 site, but the sinkhole which opened near the mine has now tripled in area since February to 118 metres by 129 metres.\\nUralkali said that during the spring thaw, average brine inflow between March 6 and June 29 was around 300 cubic metres per hour.\\nIf there is no significant increase in flooding, Uralkali expects production to be higher than originally planned for 2015, Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Osipov said during a June 29 conference call. The company is managing some production from SK-2 in the clean-up process and Osipov said that output could reach 10.4-10.8 million mt in 2015 rather than the original estimate of 10.2 million mt, made following the initial mine incident. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.\\nThe news comes as the Russian producer announced on June 23 that it reviewed the results of a recent share-buyback programme and may de-list from the London Stock Exchange.\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nK+S rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal\\nThe board at K+S rejected its proposed takeover by PotashCorp, arguing that it does not reflect the fundamental value of K+S and was \"not in the best interest of the company\".\\nK+S confirmed that PotashCorp has offered €41 per share to acquire all of the outstanding shares in the company via a written proposal.\\n\"Not only does this proposal undervalue our potash and magnesium products and our salt business, it completely disregards the value of our Legacy Project,\" K+S chief executive Norbert Steiner said in a statement.\\nThe offer represented a 40% premium to K+S\\'s share price when it was made public on June 25 but since then shares have rallied and are currently seen at €37.\\nK+S pegged the value of Legacy at up to €21 per share and said this value is not reflected in their current share price.\\nThe German miner has already invested more than €2 billion in the project, with first production expected by the end of 2016 and positive cash flows planned from 2017 onwards.\\n\"We believe PotashCorp is trying to take advantage of the valuation gap to take over K+S and gain control over Legacy,\" Steiner added.\\nThe K+S board said the proposals are not in the best interest of the company, noting that PotashCorp has not shown it has a sustained interest in continuing the company\\'s fertilizer and salt businesses in their current form.\\n\"PotashCorp has made no firm commitments to protect the interests of the more than 14,000 employees of K+S worldwide. Despite repeated requests to address this question, PotashCorp\\'s answers have remained vague,\" Steiner added.\\nLast week, K+S said that PotashCorp informed the company that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.\\nFor more information on the proposed takeover please see Fertilizer Week\\'s recent Insight on the offer.\\nPEOPLE\\nBHP Billiton hands responsibility for Jansen potash project to Valle\\nBHP Billiton has shifted the leadership of its major Jansen potash development project in Canada to group project-management executive Dean Dalla Valle.\\nThe company named Valle as chief commercial officer and said he would oversee the Jansen development rather than petroleum president Tim Cutt.

Still, the majority of sources expect the new price will support the spot markets and at least provide a floor for suppliers to push against.\\nProducers have now begun to go on the offensive and aim to secure increases across the spot markets. In Brazil, where recent price falls have been most evident, this week prices are stable at $335-350/mt CFR. While the current price remains well below suppliers’ previous target of $380/mt CFR, suppliers want to return to regular $350/mt CFR levels shortly as spring buying builds up.\\nIn Southeast Asia, there have been some price increases this week on the Chinese contract news but suppliers remain well below their continued target of $350/mt CFR. In Malaysia, prices are not quoted below $315/mt CFR this week and suppliers want to bring Malaysian prices up towards the $330-335/mt range. In Indonesia, a tender for 100,000 mt MOP should signal whether prices can increase above the $330/mt CFR level seen in recent Indonesian tenders while in Vietnam some deals have been confirmed as high as $345/mt CFR.\\nGranular potash prices continue to be quoted at €300-310/mt CIF in Northwest Europe. Suppliers are pushing for prices as high as €320/mt FCA, which with current exchange rates would represent roughly $350/mt.\\nUS NOLA prices weakened a little more this week and can now be seen as low as $350/st FOB, around a $20/st fall since the start of 2015 while fertilizer application has begun in the Midwest but prices remain in the wide range of $375-400/st FOB.\\nIn China, port wholesale prices fell this week and are expected to move down towards the new Chinese contract price in the coming months. Values are seen in the FCA range of RMB 2,080-2,200 ($335-354)/mt for standard product, a fall from RMB 2,100-2,200/mt. Large volumes are expected to arrive into the country in the coming months and 1.4 million mt was imported in January and February this year.\\nAll of the major suppliers are expected to also sign Chinese contracts at the $315/mt CFR level and quantities should be agreed within the next couple of weeks. BPC says it is currently in talks for firm volumes of at least 700,000 mt while Uralkali expects to sign firm volume quantities at a similar level to last year. BPC shipped roughly\\n1.8million mt to China in 2014 and is likely to ship at least 2 million mt in the coming year.\\nPOTASH | 2\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nDespite a new benchmark potash price low in China, players still await news on India’s next 180 days contract. IPL is believed to be entering talks with major suppliers in the coming weeks but some do not expect to sign the contract until the second half of April as Indian players await news on the Nutrient Based Subsidy and with a set of holidays in the first half of the month.\\nIPL is expected to start negotiations seeking a rollover but it is likely that the new deal will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-335/mt CFR. Uralkali was last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit.\\nBPC has now made its voice heard. The company’s decision to undercut Canpotex and Uralkali’s price target for the Chinese contract has enhanced its standing when a little over a year ago there were major questions over how Belaruskali would respond to the collapse of its union with Uralkali.\\nThe former cartel structure and price discipline of the major players has weakened and with new companies such as BHP Billiton set to join the market in the next five to ten years, competition is on the rise.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\nChinese contract volume agreements expected next week Indian contract may not be signed until end of April\\nSE Asian potash price up, $315-345/mt CFR from $310-335/mt\\nCFR\\nEuropean SOP price up, €450-470/mt FCA from €440-460/mt\\nFCA\\nUS NOLA price down, $350-355/st FOB from $355-355/st FOB Chinese domestic price down at RMB2,080-2,200/mt FCA China imported 1.4 million mt of MOP in Jan-Feb\\nIndia\\'s NFL tenders for 50,000 mt MOP, closing April 13 Malaysia imported 1.6 million mt of MOP in 2014\\nSinar Mas tenders for 100,000 mt MOP, offers at $335-350/mt\\nCFR\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nSUMMARY OF IMPORT TENDERS\\nPOTASH | 3\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nNPKs\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nINDIA\\nIndian NPK production could rise on higher phosacid price\\nIndia’s H1 2015 phosacid contract was signed at $805/mt CFR this week, an increase from $765/mt CFR in H2 2015.\\nWith high phosacid prices a key reason for increased NPK production in India during 2014, the large price increase may cause even more Indian producers to switch from DAP to NPK production in the coming year to reduce costs.\\nHowever, with a slightly higher potash price expected when the H1 2015 contract is signed in the coming weeks, and if ammonia prices continue to fall in India, then producers may look to focus on products that can utilise lower ammonia costs, such as DAP.\\nPOTASH | 4\\nSeparately, PhosAgro is believed to have sold two cargoes of 10-26- 26 to India at $440/mt CFR, one to IPL for April shipment and the other to Deepak Fertilisers for March shipment.\\nIPL also bought roughly 60,000 mt of 16-16-16 from Acron for March shipment.\\nIndian NPK prices for 10-26-26 remain in the range of $435-440/mt this week.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChina’s NPK imports near 200,000 mt in 2015\\nChina imported 192,351 mt of NPKs in January and February, more than double the 85,446 mt imported during the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nChina received 45% of the NPKs from Yara, while 24% came from Russian producers and 12% from Belgian producers. Romanian and Finnish producers also sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt.\\nChinese NPK demand was very strong in 2014 but NPK imports fell to 1.1 million mt from 1.3 million mt in 2013, partly due to increased domestic supply. With some small Chinese NPK plants down during March due to environmental concerns, NPK imports in March may have also had to increase compared to normal.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMOP\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nUS MIDWEST\\nField work begins in US Midwest\\nFertilizer applications have begun in the Midwest, but the price range for granular potash remains a point of contention.\\nSome suppliers west of the Mississippi River report sales continued at $375/st FOB, while buyers elswhere in the region reported price demands as high as $410/st FOB. While field work is starting slowly, ground conditions are improving and the next two weeks should see substantial application work and further shipments to retailers to meet demand.\\nUS NOLA\\nMALAYSIA\\nMalaysia’s full-year NPK exports more than double\\nMalaysia exported 220,564 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, more than double the 98,504 mt it exported in 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nMore than 200,000 mt of the exports went to Indonesia, with small volumes also going to Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.\\nMalaysia imported 331,141 mt of NPKs in the full year 2014, largely flat against its 2013 imports.\\nThe country’s trade flow was similar to previous years with NPKs from Belgium and Holland making up roughly 40% of the exports. Indian, Russian, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Norwegian, Chinese and Swiss producers all sent volumes exceeding 10,000 mt to Malaysia in 2014.\\nPalm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and following flooding in the first quarter of 2015, NPK imports may fall in upcoming January and February data compared to 2014.\\nBuyers holding out for lower prices again\\nThe re-opening of much of the upper Mississippi River over the prior two weeks is revealing demand for spot granular potash barges.\\nHowever, up river buyers, as well as traders along the Arkansas River are bidding as low as $340/st FOB New Orleans this week, despite reports of business at $355/st FOB in the prior couple of weeks.\\nMeanwhile, indications from BPC suggest it will not begin another round of potash exports to the US before Q3, presumably targeting arrivals in time to move north as fill sales over the summer.\\nPOTASH | 5\\nBRAZIL\\nBrazil prices at stable low following Chinese contract\\nBrazilian potash prices are not quoted below $335/mt CFR this week as news of the new Chinese contract may have signalled an end to the freefall in values.\\nThe spot price in Brazil has fallen by $35-40/mt since the start of 2015 amid a seasonal lull in demand and weak real exchange rates.\\nWhile imports fell 19% in the first two months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, suppliers hope that with spring buying season building up and a benchmark low set on the Chinese contract, prices will soon begin firming.\\nPrices in Brazil are now seen in the range of $335-350/mt CFR, a significant distance from suppliers’ price target in Q4 2014 of $380/mt CFR but sources say that suppliers are looking to firm the price back to $350/mt CFR in the coming weeks.\\nEUROPE\\nEuropean potash prices yet to reach targets\\nSome potash suppliers have yet to reach their target price in Europe but recent exchange rate improvements have meant that potash deals are now seen in a similar price range to both Brazil and US NOLA.\\nPrices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF after Uralkali joined SQM and ICL at a price of €315-320/mt FCA for gMOP recently. Suppliers are seeing more deals at €315/mt FCA but are yet to achieve €320/mt FCA deals.\\nEven the €315/mt price translates to $347/mt at current exchange rates, slightly above the current average potash price in Brazil and roughly $5/mt below the average US NOLA price, meaning that the European price is not as comparatively weak as seen in previous weeks.\\nIn the twelve months ending March 12, the euro fell 32% against the dollar but in the last two weeks there has been a 4.2% recovery, slightly improving the return for potash suppliers in Europe.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nISRAEL\\nICL explores NOP plant option\\nICL is considering an NOP plant to increase its production of soluble fertilizers and food-grade phosphoric acid, the company said in a statement.\\nThe company’s plan is part of its previously announced ‘Next Step Forward’ growth strategy in order to deal with what it considers increased demand for specialty fertilizers and to secure more of ICL’s internal needs.\\nICL has started a project to study the best locations for a new NOP plant based on considerations like the supply of raw materials, logistics and proximity to customers.\\nICL has also launched a GBP 50 million expansion plan at the Cleveland Potash mine in the UK, according to media reports. The company plans to build a granulation plant which could be operative in three years, turning fine polyhalite into granules for agricultural use.\\nThe company’s Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations in Israel continue to be suspended due to strikes over lay-offs and a two-week negotiating period between unions and ICL goes on.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nINDIA\\nNFL tenders for 50,000 mt of potash\\nIndia’s National Fertilizers Ltd. issued a tender for the import of 50,000 mt of MOP, which closes on April 13.\\nThe tender is for H1 May delivery in two shipments of 25,000 mt across multiple Indian ports.\\nIt is likely that an agreement over the next Indian H1 potash contract will be signed before the closing date so offers should be based on the new price.\\nRCF also has a tender for 145,000 mt of MOP which was extended last week to close March 31, from March 18, in order to have an idea of the new contract price. The H1 2014 contract price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the new contract is likely to be signed by early April.\\nMMTC potash tender extended\\nIndia’s MMTC extended the closing date on its import tender for 145,000 mt potash and another 200,000 mt at the company’s option.\\nThe new closing date is March 27, rather than March 16.\\nPOTASH | 6\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nLast week, India’s RCF extended the closing date on its tender for 145,000 mt potash along with 120,000 mt of optional tonnage to March 31 from March 18.\\nBoth tenders will be a strong indicator for the new Indian contract price, which is expected to be settled around the start of April. The current Indian contract is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nOf MMTC’s firm quantity, 75,000 mt is for April delivery, 30,000 mt for May delivery and 40,000 mt for June delivery at Indian ports.\\nNew Indian contract awaiting NBS rate\\nIPL is believed to be entering talks with major suppliers in the coming weeks regarding the new Indian H1 2015 contract price but\\nsome suppliers are not expecting to sign the major deal until the second half of April.\\nWith the new Chinese contract signed at a $10/mt increase following a significant delay, Indian players should enter talks shortly, but buyers want confirmation that the Nutrient Based Subsidy will be unchanged for potash. The new NBS should be in place in the next couple of weeks.\\nIPL is expected to start negotiations seeking a rollover but it is likely that the new deal will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-335/mt CFR. Uralkali were last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit deal.\\nDemand for potash is expected to remain high in the coming year and news of a higher Indian phosacid contract price may push more fertilizer companies in India to increase MOP imports and produce more NPKs rather than DAP. Current MOP import estimates for the upcoming fertilizer year are 4.5-5 million mt.\\nThere are just two potash shipments scheduled for the coming week. A 22,486 mt shipment from BPC to Chambal and a 17,856 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChina imports more than 600,000 mt of potash in February\\nChina imported 629,208 mt of MOP in February, 18% more year on year and its largest February MOP imports since 2007, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the month, China imported 236,046 mt from BPC, an increase from just 46,944 mt in February 2013. The country also imported 148,851 mt from Uralkali via rail, 124,277 mt from Canpotex, 57,680 mt from APC, 38,320 mt from ICL and 23,445 mt from K+S.\\nSo far in 2015, China’s MOP imports are up 34% compared to the same period in 2014, at 1.4 million mt.\\nFresh cargoes have continued to arrive into China in recent weeks. 12 vessels with nearly 400,000 mt arrived or are scheduled to arrive in March while at least 300,000 mt is due in April, according to sources.\\nMuch of the volumes have been sent to bonded warehouses\\nPOTASH | 7\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nand are likely to be held so that suppliers can immediately begin deliveries for spring application once contract quantities have been agreed.\\nmt rather than its normal 40,000 mt. Following settlement of the Chinese H1 2015 deal, these larger inventories should begin returning to normal.\\nQuantities for the new contract have yet to be agreed by BPC but are expected to be in the coming week or so. BPC said this week that it is currently in talks with three buyers for firm volumes of at least 700,000 mt altogether.\\nThe other major suppliers are expected to also sign contracts at the $315/mt CFR contract price in the coming weeks. Uralkali currently expects to sign firm quantities at a similar level to last year.\\nINDONESIA\\nSinar Mas tenders for 100,000 mt\\nMOP\\nIndonesia’s SMART (Sinar Mas) tendered for 100,000 mt of potash, according to sources.\\nThe tender closed last week but a decision is unlikely until the first week of April.\\nAll major suppliers are said to have made an offer as part of the tender and they continue to target $350/mt CFR, according to sources. Still, an offer may have already been made at $335/mt CFR, which could be a sign that the tender will be awarded at around $330/mt CFR.\\nThe last major Indonesian tender, by Petrokimia Gresik’s for 100,000 mt, was awarded at roughly $330/mt CFR.\\nIn September 2014, Sinar Mas tendered for 100,000 mt in a deal which was awarded to Canpotex, which regularly provides potash to Sinar Mas.\\nSinar Mas is a local tender, supplied by local distributors from their inventories and as such it requires pricing on a delivered basis to each of their plantations, making it difficult to determine the actual price offered by the local participants.\\nChina\\'s domestic potash prices slide after contract settlement\\nChina\\'s port wholesale prices have fallen this week following news that BPC settled its Chinese H1 2015 contract as $315/mt CFR, an increase of $10/mt.\\nPrices are seen in the FCA range of RMB 2,080-2,200 ($335-354)/mt for standard product, a fall from RMB 2,100-2,200/mt. Deals for the white 62% K2O product are currently being made below RMB 2,220/mt with unconfirmed deals as low as RMB 2,150/mt.\\nMost buyers continue to expect large volumes to arrive in the coming months after 1.4 million mt entered the country in January and February.\\nSome buyers have been building inventories in recent months, for example one medium NPK plant built up MOP stocks to 100,000\\nMALAYSIA\\nMalaysian potash imports reach 1.6 million mt in 2014\\nMalaysia imported 1.6 million mt of potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and its largest recorded yearly imports, according to GTIS data.\\nThe country imported more than 600,000 mt of potash from Canpotex, which slightly increased its overall volumes to Malaysia but lost almost 10% of its market share as Uralkali and BPC increased their sales to Malaysia. Uralkali more than tripled its volumes to Malaysia in 2014, sending 338,778 mt while BPC more than doubled its volumes, sending 288,470 mt.\\nPOTASH | 8\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nIn December, Malaysia imported 65,496 mt of potash, a fall of 41% compared to December 2013. The country imported 18,499 mt from Uralkali and 28,495 mt from BPC.\\nThe increase in potash imports is largely due to increased palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower level due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.\\nSoutheast Asian prices may firm on new Chinese deal\\nThere are indications that Southeast Asian potash markets may be poised for a slight recovery following a first quarter dip after suppliers failed to regularly achieve their target of $350/mt CFR.\\nPrices in the smaller MOP market of Vietnam have been quoted as high as $345/mt CFR, a $10/mt increase from last week and a new Indonesian tender from Sinar Mas for 100,000 mt of potash is believed to have received offers in the range of $335-350/mt CFR.\\nUralkali have signed one 25,000 mt cargo of standard and granular MOP to Vietnam at around $335/mt CFR while BPC signed two shipments to Vietnam of 35,000 mt each, with an average price of around $345/mt.\\nOn the other hand, Malaysian prices are still quoted as low as\\n$315/mt CFR with bids recently made as low as $295/mt CFR due to the weak ringgit and agricultural commodity price. The region is also out of season.\\nUralkali said it has sent a cargo to Malaysia as a regular deal with a regional NPK producer but was unwilling to announce the\\nprice. Canpotex, Uralkali and BPC have signalled a price push in Malaysia, according to sources, and hope to move back up towards the $330-335/mt CFR range.\\nNext month, both Malaysia and Indonesia will reintroduce a palm oil export tax. While palm oil output is expected to improve slightly in the countries next year, a new report from the US Department of Agriculture\\'s Kuala Lumpur bureau expects there will be a minor decline in Malaysian palm oil exports next season.\\nOverall Southeast Asian potash prices are seen higher than last week at $315-345/mt CFR rather than $310-335/mt CFR with the wide range due to weak prices in Malaysia and indications of prices in the $330-345/mt range in the other Southeast Asian markets.\\nBPC’s new Chinese contract price is 2-3% lower than the current average Southeast Asian spot price. With Southeast Asian spot prices often as much as 7% higher than the Chinese contract price, the new deal may also help to strengthen prices in the region ahead of the new Malaysian tender season in late April/early May.\\nSOP\\nEUROPE\\nEuropean SOP prices up ahead of Q2 price discussions\\nEuropean SOP prices have seen a slight increase to €450-470/mt FCA, following recent MOP price increases in the European market to offset the weak euro.\\nMOP producers are about to start discussions over Q2 prices and an increase in MOP prices will likely also force up SOP prices in the next quarter amid tight SOP supply until the second half of 2015.\\nThe SOP prices represent normal short-term contract deals in the region as limited supply has meant spot deals are almost impossible to complete. K+S may have closed spot deals as high as €500/mt FCA according to some sources but these unconfirmed deals are not representative of the wider market.\\nTessenderlo expects increased SOP production in the second half of 2015 once it has converted its plant in Ham, Belgium, to a stand- alone SOP unit while other suppliers may also bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year.\\nPOTASH | 9\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7811 145370\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nCopyright notice:\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Price increases have been achieved and further gains seem likely as February tonnage is now at a premium.\\n∙The US Gulf has been pivotal in providing a foundation for the price uptick with prices there now reflecting over $210pt fob Middle East for March barges.\\n∙While not in its major buying period, Brazil is seeking prompt tonnage. Little product is on offer with the diversion of Middle East product to the US Gulf a factor. Buyers are facing offers of $205pt cfr and above.\\n∙Supply problems in Egypt and Algeria have played a part with product lost from several plants.\\n∙Middle East product has ben sold for shipment to Europe over $200pt fob.\\n∙In Asia Indonesian supply is locked in for now with no willingness to sell at current levels. Chinese prilled and granular suppliers headed into the New Year holiday quoting $195-200pt fob for prills and $200pt fob minimum for granular. Thai spot demand also emerged with a cargo sold at $196pt cfr, a price that looks set to be the low for the next 1-2 months.\\n∙FSU prills have also recovered with traders covering short sales to Europe, Turkey and Africa paying up to $192pt fob Baltic and $200pt fob Yuzhnyy.\\nWith most February tonnage accounted for, traders short and buyers still needing February/first half March shipments, the scene appears set for prices to move higher over the coming weeks.

One 5,000t lot has been sold at $192pt fob and 25,000t for early March in the high-$180s pt fob (this for Africa). Uralchem and other suppliers are now aiming for well over $190pt fob.\\nGrodno: Grodno offered granular urea for February lifting this week and is understood to have rejected bids around $200pt fob. The company will reoffer the 20,000t in a new sales tender 5 February.\\nPhosagro: Nitron is loading 10,000t with other products for ec Mexico. The urea is understood to have been booked around $190pt fob..\\nUralchem: 5,000t of prills have been sold to Nitron around $192pt fob for shipment with Mendeleevsk granular to Canada.\\nSBU: 10,000t have been sold to Helm for Europe at a reported $190pt fob and 25,000t to Yara at $185-190pt fob. SBU has also sold an early March cargo to a trader for Africa in the same price range.\\nAfrica/Mediterranean\\nEgypt: The MOPCO complex at Damietta could be down for 2-4 weeks following an explosion affecting a gas pipeline on 25 January. The complex comprises three granular urea plants.\\nOther producers are also understood to have faced disruptions to gas supplies. AFC and HFC have resumed production while OCI was reported to be operating at 70% this week. Some also attribute the gas outages to the late arrival of an LNG vessel.\\nAs news of the disruption has spread, coupled with the reports from Algeria, see below, prices have advanced. OCI is understood to have sold granular earlier this week at or just over $215pt fob to a trader for shipment to Europe but has now raised its prices ideas. Trammo and Helm have since bought from HFC at $224pt fob.\\nAlgeria: AOA has both urea lines down. One unit is expected to restart shortly. Helm is in the freight market for 8,000t of urea from Arzew to Brake, Germany loading mid-February. Sorfert achieved premiums of $6- 7pt for over Egypt for its February tonnage.\\nSouth America\\nVenezuela: One spot cargo appears available for end- February which could head to the USA or Brazil. Earlier a cargo was thought to be destined for Chile, but latest reports indicate that this has been cancelled. A cargo is being shipped to Colombia this month.\\nUrea Supply – East\\nMiddle East: Granular urea prices have bounced back with higher netbacks possible in Brazil and the USA and a spot cargo sold to Europe over $200pt fob.. Latest offers into Brazil reflect close to $195pt fob. US netbacks are higher with March barge prices reflecting $205pt fob or above.\\n∙Qatar: Three shipments to the USA are expected in February. Two are possible to Thailand, one via Pepfert. Ameropa has a late February cargo for Brazil. No other Brazilian shipments appear planned.\\n∙Oman: Nitron has purchased 20,000t at $197pt fob for shipment to Argentina and Uruguay with DAP and MAP from Saudi Arabia. SIUCI is aiming for $200pt fob for March. Keytrade is in the freight market for 35,000t to the US Gulf, loading mid-February.\\n∙UAE: Further to last week 11,000t will be shipped to Sudan at a reported price over $220pt fob, this under a previous sale.\\nKuwait: PIC has sold 25,000t for February/March shipment in the low-$200s pt fob. The product is for\\nEurope. Liven is understood to have a cargo to load this month for Thailand. There are also reports that a cargo of granular urea may be shipped to the US west coast.\\n∙Iran: It is understood that export availability will be limited into March. This could be related to gas supply cutbacks which often occur in winter. A trader has one spot cargo of granular to load later in February.\\nMiddle East Export Sales February\\nChina: Ahead of the New Year break Chinese prices have held. A trader has covered a February shipment to Taiwan around $200pt fob (prills) and both prilled and granular producers are now at $195-200pt fob. A positive for suppliers has been an increase of Rmb 100pt in the domestic market. While port inventory remains high, buying for spring application is expected to build after the New Year break which could reduce the need for producers to keep sending large volumes to the ports.\\nLatest developments\\n∙A cargo of granular urea has been sold for Mexico around $195pt fob.\\n∙Fudao is expected to shut at least one granular urea line for turnaround in March/April.\\nIndonesia: There are no moves to place urea with the new management at Kaltim considering a switch to more ammonia. The latest price in South Korea, would reflect over $300pt fob for ammonia. The urea price sought is $230pt fob to cover current costs based on $5.50-6.00/mmBtu gas.\\nUrea Demand - West\\nEurope/Med\\nFrance: Trader offers have moved up for March from €225pt FCA French Atlantic bulk to €228pt FCA bulk and above. A number of offers have been withdrawn this week. The increases are attributed in part to concerns over the supply situation in Egypt.\\nThe latest gains for the Euro, trading at €/$1.11, are also providing support to prices and importers/buyers to move for new product.\\nTurkey: It has been a slow week in Turkey with buyers focusing efforts on non-nitrogen based fertilizers. Offers into Turkey have increased following earlier low-priced sales down to $190pt cfr southern Turkey (see last week’s report).\\nTurkey is normally a major buyer for March-May arrival with 2015 imports over this period around 450,000t of prilled and granular.\\nGubretas closed a tender 4 February for 10,000t of urea for prompt shipment.\\nNorth America\\nUS Gulf: Granular urea values moved up sharply mid- week and have settled in the $205-210ps ton range for February and March, over $15ps ton above concluded trades on Monday. The upward movement was bolstered by CF Industries acquiring barges for February and March. The activity led to speculation in the market of production issues at Donaldsonville although there has been no confirmation of this.\\nIn terms of prices by month, February has traded at a high of $208ps ton, with March at $211ps ton. The latter reflects over $210pt fob Arab Gulf, still above what is possible in other markets for Middle East granular urea.\\nProspects for prices over the coming month are dependent on the willingness of buyers to secure product ahead of the spring season at current levels. The US remains a premium market and could still attract some further tonnes for March arrival. However, the additions would not be massive as Europe and, to a lesser extent, Brazil are also competing for remaining February loaders.\\nLooking further ahead, Q2 physical barges have traded in the mid-$190s ps ton this week.\\nImports: There have been no additions to the import line-up for February and March. The estimated total through end March is still lagging 2014/15.\\nUS Gulf/ec Gran Urea Imports 2015/16\\nCF-CHS deal: CHS has begun taking product from CF Industries under its previously announced $2.8 billion strategic venture. From the start of this month CHS is entitled to purchase up to 1.1 million short tons of granular urea and 580,000 short tons of UAN annually from CF Nitrogen. The volume represents approximately 8.9% of CF’s total production capacity once expansion projects are completed at Donaldsonville, La., and Port Neal, Iowa, all expected in 2016. The new urea plant at Donaldsonville is already running.\\nCorn: Corn values are up on last week with March contracts around $3.73($.3.65/bu last week) and December at $3.95/bu ($3.87/bu last week) at presstime.\\nCanada: La Coop has been in the market for 20- 25,000t of granular urea for March shipment. It is understood to have bought at $215pt cfr reflecting $190 pt fob Baltic. Nitron has been linked with the business.\\nLatin America\\nBrazil: Offer levels of granular urea have increased with product loading February in the Middle East now quoted at $205pt cfr. One sale has been made at $200pt cfr.\\nFertipar and Herringer are still looking for February\\ntonnage while Yara is also understood to require granular as there is no shipment from Qatar. Against these inquiries there is little product available as recent low prices and better returns from the USA have limited the flow to Brazil from the Middle East.\\nFurther to last week, it is now understood the full cargo sale to Fertipar at $185-190pt cfr is for March through June shipment.\\nMexico: The Buying Group closed a tender 4 February for 25,000t of prilled or granular urea for shipment February to 3 ports ec Mexico. In addition, a smaller group of buyers is expected to announce a tender shortly for a prilled urea cargo.\\nOther Mexican inquiry is evident but Pronamex and Agrogen are aiming for very low, unworkable numbers below $190pt cfr. Higher prices will have to be paid if February tonnage is required.\\nNew Zealand: Urea imports were 598,000t in 2015, 10% ahead of 2014.\\nUAN Solutions\\nUAN prices remain subdued. However, as with urea, prices in Europe should soon find a floor for the spring as levels in the low to mid-$160s pt cfr France equivalent are low.\\nIn the US barge prices are assessed around $150ps ton fob Nola although terminal levels reflect higher levels. Should the improvement in urea be maintained UAN prices could find support above the paper market business concluded for March in the low-$140s ps ton fob.\\n$ps ton fob Nola\\nUS Gulf Nitrogen\\nHonduras: Fertica is in the market for a granular urea cargo.\\nGuatemala: Incofe is expected to enter the market shortly for 25,000t of urea.\\nUrea Demand - East\\nAsia/Pacific Rim\\nIndia: Of the 1.5m. tonnes awarded under the last IPL tender, around 160,000t of urea are reported to have been rejected owing to late shipment, loading or quality issues. This includes cargoes from Iran and China. At least one cargo is understood to have been diverted.\\nSouth Korea: The Pungnong tender for 6,000t of granular urea for shipment by 20 February is reported to have been awarded in the mid to high-$180s pt fob China equivalent.\\nKg Chemical has booked 3,000t of Chinese granular just below $200pt cfr.

This is understood to be for shipment from Kuwait.\\nFrance: UAN has dipped to just below €150pt FCA Rouen for March/April, around $164-165pt cfr basis the stronger US dollar Euro rate. €140pt FCA is quoted for the new season, June-September.\\nBaltic: Achema is expected to resolve catalyst problems and resume production at the end of February. Grodno is moving all product to the domestic market and has no export tender planned at this stage. Agronova has fixed a vessel to load 33,000t prompt for the US east coast.\\nUS Gulf: UAN is put at around $150ps ton fob Nola but with no business to report. Upriver prompt tonnage is being offered at $155ps ton fob. East coast prices are put at $160-165pt cfr but with no sales to report.\\nEurochem is loading 30,000t of UAN in Novorossisk for the US east coast, fixed around $34pt.\\nCanada: Inquiries for UAN are surfacing for arrival end March onwards.\\nArgentina: Nitron has sold a cargo of CF Industries UAN to Bunge at around $175pt cfr reflecting an estimated $135pt fob US Gulf.\\nNitrates/Sulphates\\nRussian AN is being indicated at $180-185pt fob, although some sources believe $175pt fob is possible. While prices are down AN is still at a high value versus urea.\\nAmsul prices are holding in China at $105-110pt fob with steel grade around $100pt fob for good quality. FSU product is put at $100-110pt fob but there is little available with most product moving domestically.\\nBaltic: AN prices are now put at $180-185pt fob, down from $195pt fob in January.

The price reflects well below $300pt fob Middle East although the product will come from Australia.\\nIn the West there have been no new price tests with Black Sea prices put at $260-265pt fob. However, the vessel line-up at Yuzhnyy is thin while the Baltic is also long. Both areas have lost February business to Trinidad/US product and prices are expected to weaken.\\nYuzhnyy: Prices are unchanged. However, the export line up for February is not full and some pressure to move second half February product could emerge. OPZ continues to run one line and has no plans to restart the unit this month.\\n∙The Clipper Orion for Koch is heading to South Korea and Taiwan\\n∙The Solaro is en route to Yuzhnyy to load around 20 February.

This comes in step with ongoing demand deferral, flat crop prices, and helped along by some trader formula fob-pricing interests. The bearish MAP sentiment has spread to markets for DAP in Europe, Pakistan and SE Asia, though each of these have prices in different tiers: Malaysia at $380pt cfr, Pakistan at $393pt cfr and EU import equivalent at $415pt cfr. China domestic markets saw some marginal erosion headed into the Spring Festival break. NOLA was again down and up in a $23pst range within a week. This came after a significant - but probably not game- changing - news of Mosaic output cuts. We had already noted this as likely due to a dip in Tampa NH3 arrivals. Since the US cutback, no other producers have followed with output changes. So supply stays firm, just like most integrated industry cash margins.\\nOne-minute briefing\\n∙Brazil MAP slides, losing $10pt more to $325 cfr, again influencing formula fobs\\n∙Mosaic cuts US phosphates production 400,000t in Q1, above our expectation\\n∙NOLA DAP up on the Mosaic news; All-week sales in wide range $312-335pst fob\\n∙No fresh fob export business from Tampa; Market awaits final lot to Australia\\n∙Several producers again criticize impact of formula business, but take no action\\n∙Phosagro statement foresees further 10% MAP price cut to $320s pt fob Baltic\\n∙The 2 points above hint the lowest-cost producers are curious to stress-test others\\n∙China domestic markets remain slow as market heads into Spring Festival break\\n∙Europe DAP prices slide, but remain some $90 pt above world MAP low (Brazil)\\n∙Crop futures, meantime, continue to make small, steady gains (chart below)\\n4 February 2016\\nPublished by\\nProfercy Phosphates SC\\nEditor Tom Jago\\nMarkets this week\\nNOLA DAP down and then up again $23pst in a week of trading; this time\\nEurope DAP slips sub €400pt fca/fot\\nNW EU; Turkey DAP prices down 6\\nPakistan takes fresh Australian export\\nChina: Lacklustre domestic market on\\nProfercy Phosphates & NPKs\\nphos@profercy.com T +34 952 833 906 M +34 665 832 954\\nDAP $pt & Corn c/bu\\nCrops vs US DAP close-up: Corn, beans consolidate; US DAP values level out after 3-month dive\\n525\\n500\\n475\\n450\\n425\\nBeans & corn consolidate\\n400futures values set over the last 4-5 weeks\\n375\\nNOLA DAP down & up sharply again in a week, in\\n350contrast to generally weak global sentiment\\n325\\n1.200\\n1.100\\n1.000\\n900\\n800\\n700\\n600\\nSoybean c/bu\\nAnalysis\\nIndustry end-February position – our take: Our first call on the global DAP, MAP, NPs industry position for end February shows a substantial surplus of about +493,000t of all grades. The biggest length is at the export point that prefers to defer export decisions each month to the last moment – namely Morocco, with an apparent build of 142kt DAP/MAP and compounds combined. As noted last week, February stock increases look inevitable as long as key markets start to see value in current prices, or unless producers make real changes to production. So far real cutbacks are confirmed only at YTH in China and Mosaic in the US. Both of these markets are among those in which seasonal demand could change the game in the short-term. This is however, yet to materialise.\\nCrop prices. Corn futures ended marginally softer on the day today, but were a few ticks up on the week, with the CME March contract at $3.69/bu by presstime. Along the forward curve, December 2016 and July 2017 corn also closed down on the day, but were up on the week to $3.92/bu and $4.09/bu respectively. Soybeans ended up on the week at $8.76/bu.\\nGlobal Producer Position\\nWorld DAP/MAP/NP snapshot\\n$ pt fob Tampa\\n675\\nTampa vacuum as export formula interests prevail; NOLA & Brazil MAP netbacks point lower\\n625\\n575\\nJust 5 up-months at Tampa in the last 18 months\\n525\\n475\\n425\\n375\\nNOLA at ave. $323pst fob = $331pt metric Tampa \\n325\\nBrazil netback on trader shorts \\n275\\nNorth America\\nUS domestic: DAP barges have traded once again in a very wide range as indexing interests rage on all sides. From the importers point of view, the low numbers influence the fob price of incoming cargoes. From local producers’ standpoint, index numbers can influence inland warehouse numbers.\\n∙So while uncertainty prevails over grower and retailer moves on phosphates buying, the index itself continues to drive market prices more than the underlying S&D.;\\n∙Prices for physical DAP have ranged this week from a low at $312pst fob for Russian and Moroccan material, up to $335pst fob on one fresh barge sold by Mosaic to a distributor in a southern US market. There were other trades on good volumes this week in between at $320, $323, $326pst fob. Some distributors had noted again seeing Mosaic buy-back bids midweek on the producer’s own material in the low/mid $320s pst fob. These were rejected as selling interest on US-origin DAP became more cautious. Mosaic has fresh – so far unsuccessful - offers out today at $340pst fob.\\nUS production: Mosaic has just announced a Q1 cutback of around 400,000t metric DAP/MAP/MES. This is bigger than our estimate noted in last week’s report (item below). We think this is partly bringing forward maintenance, and partly in connection with a major DAP/MAP conversion to MES.\\n∙Mosaic market take: Mosaic explained the cutback move saying it believes current market prices do not reflect the value it sees for its products. The company also said it is not participating nor selling at the low price level seen in Brazil today nor at NOLA in the last few weeks.\\n∙So far no other producers have followed the US and China with cutback initiatives. For now exports from Russia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia are still supporting trader formula priced deals on MAP into Brazil and the US, and therefore are exposed to lower-priced short-selling.\\nFrom our last Weekly Report: With only 4 cargoes of ammonia into Tampa in January….our speculation is for an overall Mosaic cutback of around\\n100-110,000tpm. The output call is complicated as Florida downtime was already likely due known major conversion work to complete at two New Wales trains from DAP/MAP to full flexibility with various MES grades.\\n∙Detail: Also as noted in our report last week: The output call is complicated as Florida downtime was already likely due the known major conversion work to complete at two New Wales trains from DAP/MAP to full flexibility with various MES grades.\\n∙Timing: The Mosaic announcement comes a few days ahead of the annual US domestic TFI meeting (in Orlando). It is known that several local traders short-sold against Mosaic last month in the period when Mosaic made some attempts to buy back its own material. We had expected Mosaic would provide guidance on Q1 production plans at an investor presentation for its Q4 and full 2015 results, however the news has come earlier.\\nUS DAP, MAP Balance\\n**Mosaic, DAP, MAP& MES rates at all 4 Florida plants and in Louisiana, taking shutdowns in Q1 – 400kt “lost” output means committed at least to end Feb\\n*Mosaic contracts & off-shore system incl.: Brazil, Colombia & Mexico.\\nMexico balance DAP, MAP\\nFertinal has end Feb carry, but this could go to Australia\\nUS export: Since Mosaic’s cutback news there are no fresh US export offers of DAP, MAP or MES into any market worldwide. The next executions from Tampa are reckoned to be to a trader for Australia (indexed to several fob quotes, likely including Tampa and China), some Mosaic system business to Brazil and contract volumes to Colombia.\\nCross-gulf Tampa to NOLA: There were no cross-gulf vessel moves in January, Most Mosaic NOLA business from strong cross-gulf volumes in Q4\\nUS import: Three MAP/DAP import cargoes are poised to land in the US from all sources over the next 4 weeks from early February to early March. There are two from Morocco (90,000t DAP/MAP in two lots via 2 traders) and a Eurochem Russian DAP/MAP panamax to the US East Coast & NOLA combined.\\nLatin America\\nBrazil: New business for a minor 5,000t part-lot of open-origin MAP is confirmed in Brazil at $325pt cfr. This is via a trader to Fertipar. It is understood Fertipar has purchased several minor part-lots in recent weeks totalling around 20,000t MAP in a range $325-340pt cfr.\\n∙Other importers are testing traders, but are asking for credit terms that producers are unwilling to cover in direct business.\\n∙This gives traders with available credit lines into Brazil good leverage with producers to cover short sales on formula pricing.\\n∙From a producer stand-point, these formula sales are the lesser of various negative outcomes which include building exposure to Brazilian distributor solvency, or reducing production. So while demand is soft in the usual price drivers at this time of year (China domestic, US & Canada\\nRussia DAP, MAP balance\\nPhosagro and Eurochem running at regular rates. Uralchem ops on one line at Voskressensk\\nLithuania balance DAP\\nPart of shipments to NW Europe are still seen in ARA area port stock\\ndomestic & inland Europe), it is simpler for producers to continue to give up Brazil cfr pricing initiative to traders.\\n∙Brazil SSP: There are reports of price declines in the local market in key internal markets – with SSP 19-21% is variously said averaging $220- 230pt fot storage to blenders ex Rondonopolis.\\nArgentina, Uruguay: A Nitron sale of DAP to a group of minor Argentine buyers is heard shipping ex Murmansk to Necochea. This is a separate cargo to the lot Phosagro sold about a month ago (for January shipping) directly to Argentina buyers. Last done for DAP and MAP is confirmed at $350-353 pt cfr 3-4 discharge ports, offers now falling into the $340s pt cfr.\\nMexico production, Fertinal nationalisation: A statement was made late last week by Fertinal late last week concerning its purchase by Pemex, and integration in Pemex Fertilizantes. This operation will “integrate the natural gas-ammonia-fertilizers value chain” according to Fertinal The key points in terms of a change with Fertinal positioning today appear to be:\\n∙Vertical integration with raw materials (the implication is cheaper, captive ammonia), though the Pemex NH3 balance is not always thought to be in surplus; and greater supply to the Mexican domestic market. The two stand-out implications here are perhaps fewer Fertinal export avails, but with this perhaps some displacement of imports via the East Coast ports from Tampa.\\n∙Today, some small farmers in Mexico have a limited access to the fertilizer supply. In order to tackle this shortage, the acquisition will help to rebuild the domestic market and the supply into less developed sectors, mainly the ones in the South & SE areas of Mexico, offering a product based on international standards and competitive prices.\\n∙The new Grupo Fertinal will continue to work in its current markets and will continue to build long term, as well as strong business relationships with current clients, contractors and suppliers which have shown their preference for the well-known worldwide quality and service that are characteristic of Grupo Fertinal.\\n∙During this transition, Fertinal’s top management will remain in their positions. The best professional experience from Pemex will join in this new venture aiming to maintain the quality of its products, to further increase its capacity and efficiency, and implement best practices.\\nEurope, Africa\\nWest Europe: DAP is heard down a further €5pt to €390pt fca ex store at most NW Europe ports. This is equivalent to the low/mid $410s pt cfr duty paid/free. Helm is now expected to move the balance of its Mexican cargo just discharged in Atlantic France to Germany.\\n∙Mexico import cargo: Helm’s import cargo of Mexican DAP has arrived in France, locals curious to see the beige colour product meeting local spec conditions and appearance preferences.\\nMorocco DAP, MAP, NP/Ks\\n*Allowing for 85,000tpm P2O5 combined phosacid to India, Pakistan (but less than usual during Fauji turnaround), Europe and Saudi, Feb granulation seen about 420,000t DAP, MAP, NPs & NPKs. OCP carry-over is significant, suggesting it needs fresh February business in Europe, or more to the US. Output cuts unlikely.\\nTunisia balance\\nGCT is heard continuing on acid and DAP on one line at Gabes. It will carry end Feb tonnage to March, unless it competes more strongly into Europe\\nTurkey: GCT is linked with two direct sales for a total 15,000t DAP into North and Med Turkey for 2H February shipment in the mid $380s pt cfr with credit, or around $380pt cfr cash. Bagfas’ 50,000t export commitment to Ethiopia for NP19-38 S & Z seems to be opening a minor, prompt import opportunity for DAP into Turkey.\\n∙January import DAP from Morocco: There are strong reports from Turkey of a Moroccan export sale of 22,000t DAP into South Turkey. Though emerging now, it is though done in early Jan near $405pt cfr.\\nTunisia: The latest business to Turkey (above) reflects near $370pt fob Gabes. While this is well below EU netbacks (indicative at around $405-408pt fob basis the latest NW European warehouse re-sales in the mid/high €390spt fca French Atlantic), it is far above indicative North African DAP/MAP yields from competitive spot action today on MAP into Brazil or DAP at NOLA.\\n∙Production & local demand: GCT is heard running at low levels on DAP at Gabes, around 35-40,000tpm. Of this, around +/-10,000tpm is heard ear-marked for local market distribution, as seasonal needs approach.\\nMorocco: OCP shipped around 90,000t of NP S B on two lots to Ethiopia as planned by the end of January. A further 90-100,000t of this grade is expected to complete now to early March.\\n∙For the US, there are reports of two separate DAP/MAP export cargoes in early February for a total 85,000t into NOLA by late February. One is heard via Koch and another through Gavilon.\\n∙We see Moroccan February dispatches moderating to around 330,000t, including a sizeable volume of 80,000t of all grades to the domestic market. This is still assuming two more NPS shipments will be completed over the next 30 days for Ethiopia.\\n∙To Turkey: The 22,000t DAP lot to Med Turkey noted above and heard shipped in late January reflects around $395pt fob Morocco, significantly lower than prices on DAP to West Europe. The move essentially re- captures market share in Turkey after Bagfas took the NP S & Z business in Ethiopia with Turkish export product.\\n∙New offers to Europe: OCP is not yet offering into Europe for next-round shipments to Europe in end February / early March. There is substantial sensitivity among buyers sitting on much higher-priced January loads. As a result, talks on new pricing – effectively for March shipment – have been postponed a few weeks. As per our earlier reports, OCP has a baseload with NPS and MAP/DAP exports to Ethiopia and the US in the near-term, but will have a stock-build up to address by end February unless a compromise is reached into Europe.\\n∙Theoretical netbacks on the European port warehouse business note above (though not yet on offer from OCP) are in the low $390spt fob North Africa. This is still a 3-digit cash margin on Moroccan DAP, though is slimmer for Tunisian. Both OCP and GCT are waiting to see if moderate EU DAP pipeline avails will trigger an 11th hour demand rebound over the next 4-6 weeks.\\nAustralia balance DAP, MAP\\nJordan balance DAP\\nSo far in 2015-16, JPMC is thought to have shipped about 170,000t DAP to India, from a base-load MoU of 300,000t. This maximum volume rarely ships Jordan to India in any fertilizer year. Minor truck movements to Iraq continue. JPMC running lower rates, so stock accumulation is moderate\\n∙Eurochem meantime looks more active in Southeast Europe, in markets such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine out of Belorechensk. This may also reflect the December stoppage at\\nPhosagro’s southern Russian Balakovo plant due the sulphur contract dispute at that time. This unit, however, is believed to have been busy with Russian domestic market demand in any case.\\nRussia: Phosagro management has forecast a near- term price bottom-out will emerge on export MAP after a further 10% price slide to levels around $320pt fob Baltic. Taking a 10% dip from our current low-end assessment today near $340pt fob, export values could slip to $305-306pt fob. Netbacks from the latest spot action in Brazil are already around this level. There have, however, been several clear statements in earlier weeks from Phosagro that it will not support formula-priced fob calculations derived from published MAP prices basis cfr Brazil.\\n∙Europe netbacks: The netback on the European business above is now around $360pt fob Baltic (net freight and EU import duty). This is still approaching a $200pt cash margin for Phosagro, currently at the bottom of the global cost curve.\\n∙Russia NPKs: The Phosagro panamax of 10-26- 26 to Deepak for early February shipment to India is reckoned to have a netback value in the $330s pt fob Baltic. This is about on a par with levels reckoned achievable for 9-25-25 in the EU, though Europe is now slow.\\nMiddle East\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic, now responsible for 30% of MPC jv exports, is not offering fresh export avails. Ma’aden has 3 further MAP cargoes for a total 120,000t MAP for February/March shipment to Latin America. Two are for Brazil heard to be for Yara (sold directly by Ma’aden via Comexport under formula), and another cargo for Argentina and Uruguay/Paraguay distribution via Nitron.\\n∙For DAP, since the Indian MoA moratorium on inland DAP movement within India, there are now unlikely to be any February loads from Ma’aden or\\nSabic to any MoU buyers.\\n∙The Ma’aden February production plan is still thought to be for 100,000t each of DAP and MAP.\\nSouth Asia\\nPakistan: Quantum is linked with a fresh 27,000t DAP sale from Australia to Pakistan. Local rumours point to business with UAC at a price in the low/mid $390s pt cfr. This is in line with the last Chinese DAP sold to India in the mid $380s pt cfr, and sharper than Saudi indications. The cargo is heard to be shipping this week ex Townsville on the MV Bright Hope.\\n∙From China a trader is now heard working a 25,000t DAP cargo to Karachi for end-February loading, said offered in the high $380s pt cfr.\\n∙Pakistan S&D; balanced, but importers see\\n“average-down” value: While Pakistan is reckoned to have enough DAP for the current Rabi season, some importers see value in new business to average down Q4 arrival business in the $450s pt cfr. It remains to be seen if enquiries from other importers emerge to test Chinese fob levels currently in the $370s pt fob.\\nIndia: An MoA internal movement ban on DAP from ports to inland markets is heard imposed with immediate effect. This is a common step ahead of the budget anticipated each year in end-February.\\n∙The move prevents fresh imports booked at the higher subsidy for the 2015-16 fertilizer year, but are sold into next campaign. If subsidy is going to be cut (as is widely expected), there can be opportunistic moves to book product into the distribution chain at today’s subsidy. No fresh imports are therefore likely on DAP from any source. This mirrors the supplier posture into last week’s MMTC tender, into which no offers were made.\\n∙NPKs exempt? The move so far apparently only affects DAP, not NPKs. One big cargo of Russian NPKs is still due into in India in 1H March.\\nIndia domestic: A Punjab Marketing Federation tender for 80,000t DAP into local storage in calendar Q2 (next fertilizer year) is heard to have found offers either side of Rs21,400pt del. This is the first clue on scope for a retail price ceiling (MRP) cut next year, down from Rs23,700pt in the 2015-16 campaign. A cut in retail ceiling of Rs1,750pt (allowing some dealer margin) is today equivalent to $25pt. There is still some time until the specifics of next year’s retail\\nIndia cont’d: prices and P, K fertilizer subsidies will be posted, even if a global, all-fertilizer subsidy figure is set in the Indian budget in late February.\\nBangladesh the first Ma’aden MoU contract DAP lot to BADC is expected to be for March loading ex RAK.\\nEast Asia, Pacific\\nChina domestic: Headed into the Spring Festival, DAP prices have stabilised after the recent producer cuts in search of liquidity. Trade is thin, however, and most distributors in north and northeast markets look set to wait out the holiday time and the current winter conditions.\\n∙DAP prices are now broadly at RMB2.650 pt fot ex inland warehouses (low $400s), reflecting the mid/high $350spt fot ex works. Local MAP 11-44 is also flat in the local market at RMB1,930spt fot ex works ($280s) in similarly slow trade, with numerous NPK plant slowdowns and shutdowns for the holiday period.\\nMKP 0-52-34; UP = Urea Phosphate * Low-end Chinese origin EU duty paid 6.5%\\nMalaysia: Nafas is heard to have taken a minor lot of Chinese DAP (17/17.5-46) at $380pt cfr.\\nChina export: The business above for DAP (17/17.5- 46) to Malaysia looks to be a netback in the mid $360s pt fob China. DAP grading guaranteed 18-46 is offered tentatively at $370-380pt fob export duty paid, according to lot size and destination, lately including India again and Pakistan (both successfully). Granular MAP 11-44 is heard indicated in the low $300s pt fob, also export duty paid.\\nAustralia: As IPL/Quantum responds to isolated DAP export opportunities (recent sales to Thailand & Pakistan), import competition for MAP remains strong. This is likely assisted by the slide in MAP values to alternative markets in the western hemisphere, for example Brazil now in the $330s pt cfr.\\n∙Next imports: Mosaic is expected to load a panamax DAP/MAP for a trader to Australia in early February, following two other US export combo lots already on the water. Ameropa is in the freight market for a fresh Mexican export lot of 40,000t MAP ex Fertinal for 2H February loading to multiple East and South Australia ports. If settled, this will be among the first exports under Pemex ownership.\\nRegular Products\\nProfercy Phosphates & NPKs Report Service Rolling market coverage, Weekly price postings, and Exporter position snap-shot, Price Forecasts\\nOutlook & Sector Analysis Reports\\nProfercy Phosphates Horizon Series\\n5-year DAP, MAP S&D; balance outlook & forecast\\nThe Economics of Phosphate\\nImport affordability multiples, mapping N, P & K values to crop prices.

Values for prills appear less likely to surge in line with the premium grade, and the duration of the rebound remains questionable due to mounting inventories perceived over the coming months unless Chinese producers elect to extend their current stand on pricing for prilled product.\\nFertilizer Week’s April Urea Short Term Forecast statement that the nosedive in urea pricing occurred early but was unlikely to last long proved timely. Middle East granular values surged this week via a forward sale by Fertil at $285/mt FOB, up by more than $40/mt on the floor evident in March sales of granular urea to Brazil via traders holding long-term contracts. The latest deal implies delivered values into Brazil close to $310/mt CFR versus the March floor around an even $260/mt CFR.\\nSimilarly, trades in barges at New Orleans moved up to $320/st FOB equivalent, but these were linked to barges previously on tow or already arrived at key distribution points. Supply hang ups that begin in the US Gulf and reach through the upper Mississippi River system have driven this continued spike in US granular urea prices. Some cargoes from the Middle East have been delayed, and movement out of the US Gulf to inland markets was slowed substantially by a shortage of tows for barges and uncooperative weather in places. A full week was added to the normal time it took to unload some cargoes to barges and move material north over the last month. Consequently, barges already on their way north were yielding up to a $20/st premium over barges in the Gulf for prompt load dates.\\nThe supply tie ups are expected to subside substantially by the second half of May, but pricing near to $300/st FOB New Orleans should continue for barges well placed to benefit from the regional shortfall.\\nOverall US urea demand is roughly in line with expectations for corn, spring wheat, rice, cotton and\\nother crops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the potential for urea to replace ammonia for some nitrogen applications shrank substantially in the last week to 10 days. A modest decline in ammonia pricing combined with higher urea costs in the Midwest and Northern Plains markets has reversed the prior ratio that favoured urea and returned ammonia to its usual role as the cheapest form of nitrogen available to farmers.\\nThe urea market will remain supply-driven throughout the forecast period. Egyptian imports of LNG are set to trigger increased exports, while capacity from Indonesia (Kaltim V) and Saudi Arabia (Safco V) is maintained for granular urea despite recent issues in the start-up phase for both units. Production from the Oman/Algerian joint venture to be sold for export is still expected to hit the market by the beginning of Q3 although export license issues such as those experienced by Sorfert could delay the process. Sorfert exports have been maintained at an average of 100,000 mt/month.\\nDeclining natural gas and coal costs are set to impact global urea prices in the coming months, but higher electricity rates in effect from April 20 will raise direct costs for Chinese mainstream producers by an estimated RMB 80- 100/mt ($13-16/mt) for anthracite-based units and RMB 30- 60/mt ($5-9/mt) for bituminous-based units.\\nThe issue of a VAT at 13% being added on all Chinese fertilizer sales, including exports, is still pending, but the possible re-introduction has not been taken into account when defining export values through October.\\nIndian demand through 2015 beyond the relatively limited 510,000 mt contracted in the April 10 STC session is set to emerge via tenders in May and beyond. The requirement can be covered from ample Chinese availability with ease, but is price sensitive given the change in cost factors and intervention by the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association (CNFIA) which may curtail exports in Q2.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nIndia sales move benchmarks down but should set floor\\nThe essence of this month\\'s report remains unchanged from the April Forecast with a similar outlook and no significant difference to the price trend.\\nThe only real difference to the price trend since the last forecast derives from a slightly lower actual price for April moving forward. The last report forecast an April price of $470/mt FOB Tampa but the actual price was $5/mt lower. The reason for this was the earlier-than-anticipated sales by Mosaic to India which brought down the netback into the mid $450s/mt FOB Tampa.\\nAlthough expected to start its shipping programme to India in Q2, the slow start to the Brazilian season and the favourable returns on Indian business prompted Mosaic to sell 200,000 mt a month or so earlier than expected. Fertilizer Week had forecast the Tampa price to dip in May/June due to Mosaic\\'s anticipated sales into India, a move that tends to bring down the average price in Tampa due to the usual cap on Indian delivered prices.\\nA combination of strong Indian demand and decent netbacks, the prolonged start to the Brazilian season and a need by Russian producers to generate cashflow has prompted substantial sales of both US and Russian DAP into India at competitive prices. Such a baseload of export business already sold for Q2 has placed both of these suppliers, Mosaic and PhosAgro, in a stronger position to start their respective Brazilian campaigns and has already had the effect of moving Russian prices higher for May/June business.\\nRather than seeing a gentle decline through April/May and into early June as forecast in the last report, we are therefore now seeing a price incline moving upwards as talk of a tighter market becomes more of a reality. Nevertheless, the peak of the market remains unchanged with June H2/July/August H1 likely to see the highest prices during the next six months, supported by robust and simultaneous demand from the Indian sub-continent and Brazil/Argentina.\\nAs seasonal demand in Brazil starts to tail off from September and much of the Indian Rabi demand has been covered, the market may come under pressure once again. Although Chinese producers will be turning their attention towards their own domestic market from end August, we must note the additional capacity in Morocco with the start of the JPH-1 unit in Q2 and the second unit due onstream by the end of\\nQ3/ Q4. Although OCP is unlikely to run all capacity at maximum and is clear about maintaining granulation levels in line with demand, the fact that a further 2 million mt capacity will be on the market by the end of the year cannot be ignored.\\nHowever, the greatest downside risk to this market over the next six months will come from India if the preliminary forecast from the IMD comes to fruition with a second consecutive \"below normal\" monsoon. As yet the negative forecast issued at the end of April has not halted the surge in buying interest currently emanating from India, in turn prompted by lower opening stocks at the start of 2015/16. Once the first tranche of Kharif demand has been covered, expected soon with quantities booked to date approaching 2 million mt, importers may become a little more cautious until there is further clarity on the eventual progression of the monsoon. Last year\\'s late rains caused a delay in the start of the Indian buying campaign and overall imports, although greater than 2013/14 at 3.8 million mt, remained some 2 million mt below the five-year average.\\nThe renewed weakness in the rupee is also of concern with a decline from INR 62 to 63 on a delivered price of $480/mt CFR equating to almost $8/mt. Therefore we can expect Indian importers to maintain pressure on the price, particularly heading towards the period of maximum Chinese export availability, May- August. The MRP is expected to stay at or above INR 23,500/mt, which with the rupee at INR 63, equates to a\\nbreakeven point in the high $480s/mt CFR, but to ensure some margin, importers will want a price sub $480/mt CFR and lower again if the rupee weakens further. The price limitations in India will continue to keep a lid on average global prices going forward despite an expected strengthening in Brazilian delivered prices as the market starts moving.\\nSofter raw material prices through the six- month period will give suppliers more leeway should these negative factors start to bear down on price. Weaker currencies in Russia and even China have given suppliers the flexibility to lower prices where\\nnecessary. Although the predicted price range for Chinese DAP is likely to remain above $450/mt FOB, at current sulphur prices the larger\\nChinese producers could accept prices nearer $400/mt FOB China and still remain above cost.\\nAs well on the bearish side, the US may have greater than expected DAP volumes to export during Q2 and Q3 as low crop values are cutting into demand, and greater than normal carryover throughout the supply chain appears likely as the spring comes to an end.\\nThe upside to the DAP market through Q2/Q3 will be provided by a potential surge in Brazilian demand with large volume seasonal requirements condensed into the May-September H1 shipping period. Coming later than last year but coinciding with other major Asian import demand, could tighten the market over the short term. As such we are most likely to see a reversal in the two-tier market with higher prices seen in Brazil and India remaining capped at lower levels, a similar trend to last year.\\nTo summarise, the market is looking stable-firm with solid demand expected from the major import markets through the rest of Q2 and much of Q3. Average prices although supported by higher prices in Brazil, will be tempered by Indian delivered values and as such the price range will be limited through much of the forecast period.\\nSULPHUR\\nForecast little changed as new capacity looms\\nFertilizer Week’s May short term forecast (STF) for sulphur is little changed from the previous month’s iteration, as most market indicators and expectations of supply and demand remain at similar levels to a month ago.\\nAs previously forecast, the Middle East FOB spot price benchmark for sulphur declined further in April, with the average for the month at $151/mt FOB after prices came under considerable pressure over the course of the month.\\nThe weakness is expected to persist with some further price declines possible before the market stabilises in May. Going into the second half of the year, prices are likely to be pressured downwards, mainly because of new capacity scheduled to come onstream.\\nMiddle East FOB prices are expected to average around $150/mt FOB in May. Both Tasweeq and Adnoc have yet to announce their prices for May, but most in the market expect slight declines from these players. Aramco Trading posted $140/mt FOB for its May price, $25/mt below its April level, but in line with current FOB levels and other Middle Eastern sellers’ official April prices. With the Chinese market stabilising and freight rates relatively low, it seems that Middle Eastern FOB levels in the low $140s/mt FOB should be achievable now, though it remains to be seen how soon any noteworthy increase in prices may happen, if at all.\\nRecent spot demand has been weak from all regions, as buyers have had limited requirements and have been waiting for the market to reach a bottom. Buying has recently picked up somewhat, but market participants believe some of the activity is speculative.\\nNonetheless, most would agree that prices are unlikely to fall much further, if at all. But no great\\nresurgence in prices seems imminent either, as the spectre of oversupply continues to hang over the market.\\nThe scale and rate of the price recovery will largely be determined by how quickly and to what extent Chinese buyers return to the market for imported tonnes, as thus far the large phosphate producers have continued to hold off buying.\\nTrade data showed that China imported 1.12 million mt of sulphur in January, their highest monthly total since March 2013. Although February imports were down 7% year on year at 793,658 mt, they were expected to be somewhat lower than usual because of the Spring Festival occurring in late February, leaving the market and ports mostly inactive for much of the second half of the month. However, March data showed a 36.3% year-on-year fall to 652,318 mt, the lowest monthly total since August 2013.\\nAlthough key phosphate producers are believed to be comfortable with stocks for now, they will likely need to engage in some stockbuilding if they wish to take advantage of demand for phosphate exports. Phosphate plant turnarounds in China will temper any price recovery.\\nThe major factor likely to determine prices over the STF period and beyond is the startup of the Shah project in the UAE. Delays in its commissioning previously made sellers more confident that the market would remain tight, and some Middle Eastern sellers claim they are fully committed through May. Shah represents the largest of the capacity increases forecast for this year, and indeed for the next five years, and is expected to be a key cause of the overall supply-demand balance moving from short to long by end-2015. Full commissioning of Shah is expected by the end of Q2. Other projects such as Barzan in Qatar, which is expected to commission in June/July, will also add to total output.\\nIn addition, sellers such as Russia are returning to the market in the Northern Hemisphere’s spring. Russian sales were hindered by rail congestion and the usual issues with river access during winter months. Although river navigation resumed at the beginning of April, low water levels have limited the scale of shipments, increasing the backlog of Russian cargoes.\\nThe increased supply from the Middle East and elsewhere, combined with US buyers’ attempts to diversify their consumption away from Canadian and domestic suppliers, is still expected to lead to a reduction in outlets for sulphur from Vancouver, adding to pressure for lower prices on Canadian exports and/or increase stockpiles in the coming months, and stockpiles have already been increasing in recent months. As Middle Eastern sellers benefit from a low export cost, the new supply will be able to sell at the margin, leaving sellers in Canada and most other regions struggling to compete with delivered prices of sulphur from the Middle East. Vancouver FOB spot prices are therefore likely to maintain a discount to Middle East FOBs, while those who can’t compete will stockpile further.\\nMeanwhile, US producers have continued increasing their international sales, with particularly strong sales to Morocco recently, displacing some more traditional sources of imports. Should prices remain sufficiently attractive, US companies are likely to export even more and potentially further displace other sellers.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nOutlook remains steady but shocks could lead to spikes\\nThe sulphuric acid price forecast for May remained relatively unchanged from the previous month’s iteration, with global prices expected to change little throughout the forecast period.\\nPrices for both Northwest Europe and Chile are forecast to remain stable in the early months of the forecast period before gradually decreasing slightly over the remainder of the forecast.\\nHaving already decreased slightly from an actual assessed average of $33/mt FOB in November and December to $32/mt FOB in January and $31/mt FOB in February, March, and April, Northwest European FOB spot prices are expected gradually to fall to $26/mt FOB by October.\\nChilean CFR spot levels have remained steady at a notional assessment of $85/mt FOB for around half a year as spot activity has been lacking, and where it has been reported it has been within the assessed range. These prices are also forecast to inch down in H2, reaching $82/mt FOB by August.\\nMarket participants had been expecting some Chilean spot demand in Q2 following the lack of enquiry in\\nQ1. However, most buyers’ requirements for H1 are believed to have been met after contract settlements for 2015 were reached in December 2014. Some Chilean demand has also been satisfied by new supply from Mexico, namely the Boleo sulphur burner. In addition, the recent floods have led to a backlog of product in tanks at ports needing to be moved to plants, and this may delay any potential spot demand, though most believe that any market impact from this is likely to be small.\\nWith contractual prices around $80/mt CFR, buyers will not be willing to pay much higher spot prices in the near term unless a buyer has an essential prompt requirement. Those who do have a prompt requirement may find themselves paying relatively high prices given a lack of Asian smelter acid.\\nSupply from Asian producers remains tight, and is likely to remain so to H2, at least. Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter, and Toho Zinc’s Onahama have limited sellers’ spot availability, and Q2 shutdowns at Korea Zinc and Glencore’s PASAR smelter in the Philippines will keep the market constricted.\\nThe tightness led to some buyers having to source sulphur-burnt product from China in March as East Asian smelters have not had smelter acid tonnes for spot sales. But such business has not been evident in April, as prompt requirements from India have diminished.\\nHowever, into H2 the situation may ease somewhat. Although PASAR is set to be down for much of Q2, and this may lead to the marginal price being slightly higher than if PASAR kept producing, increased absence of a relatively small producer that has been running at low rates for the past year is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on availability. In addition, the smelter is understood to be incorporating a production\\nexpansion, although this is unlikely to materially affect traded volumes from the plant until 2016. However, any extra tonnes from the plant will end up on the market, as it is expected to be some time before the Philphos plant is back up. There is thus widespread concern in the market over when, and by how much, PASAR’s acid production will increase.\\nChinese demand for imported sulphuric acid has been much weaker thus far in 2015 than the previous year, and is likely to remain at a similar level given current prices.\\nOverall, the upside risk to the Chilean CFR forecast is greater than the downside risk because of the tight availability.\\nEuropean FOB levels are expected to undergo some downward pressure, but no return to the low FOB prices of H1 2014 is expected, as supply in this region is also tight.\\nPrice increases from late H1 2014 onwards from the lows of $0-5/mt FOB seen at the beginning of the year were driven by some production issues at European smelters and by stronger-than- expected demand. Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns, demand from European buyers was firm in 2014. In addition, strong spot demand\\nfrom Morocco combined with improved Brazilian demand to tighten the market in H2 2014.\\nBut these demand sources will not necessarily be as strong in 2015, despite a relatively firm start to the year.\\nMoroccan demand for spot sulphuric acid has declined and is expected to decline further over the next few months, with the buyer currently limiting itself to contractual volumes. OCP’s new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit started in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus acid available for use in OCP\\'s other facilities. Weaker sulphur prices also make the buyer less willing to pay higher prices for acid. Thus, although OCP has remained an important source of demand so far this year, it is unlikely to be very active in sulphuric acid over the next few months, and its overall sulphuric acid imports for 2015 are likely to be lower than last year.\\nBrazil’s annual imports were stable in 2014 following a weak December, and they remained well below the year before that. The January and February figures for 2015 were up considerably year on year, but at least some of this demand was met by Mexican supply, leaving Europeans waiting for enquiries. March imports dropped 59% on the year, but this was not enough to offset the earlier increases, leaving Q1 imports double those of Q1 2014.\\nRecent spot business to Brazil has remained in the $80s/mt CFR, despite insistence by some that European tightness should push them higher.\\nDemand for contractual volumes from European buyers remains strong, and this means that sellers are not under tremendous pressure to shift tonnes at this stage. Indeed, European contract prices are widely expected to remain stable from Q1 to Q2, and some sellers believe they can achieve an increase.\\nBut industrial demand in Europe remains a source of much uncertainty, and the macro economy could see further recovery or greater weakness, though the current outlook does not offer much hope for imminent recovery, and European demand is likely to be underwhelming.\\nMeanwhile, Dundee Precious Metals’ sulphuric acid plant at its copper smelter in Tsumeb, Namibia, is currently expected to begin running in June. CRU forecasts sulphuric acid supply from the plant of around 140,000 mt in 2015, with this increasing to 310,000 mt/year from 2016.\\nDundee has a supply agreement with Rössing Uranium for the annual purchase of 225,000 t/y of sulphuric acid, and other supply agreements are under negotiation with Weatherly International and Protea Chemicals. The plant will therefore remove the requirement for Rössing to import acid from 2017, leaving one fewer outlet for European exporters.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Availability is understood to be tight, and sellers report enquiries for both spot volumes and contractual top-ups.\\nMarket participants are waiting for Aramco to finalise its July price on June 10. An increase is expected, though the scale of the increase has yet to be determined.\\nIn addition, Middle Eastern sellers are hoping to finalise all Q3 contract talks next week in advance of Ramadan, and these talks will also provide indications of the market direction.\\nDomestic Chinese prices also climbed, as domestic availability was relatively tight. Sources also suggested that buyers in China were demonstrating a greater willingness to accept import prices in the high $150s/mt CFR than last week.\\nHowever, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand, as monsoon delays and the weak rupee add further impetus for declines in Chinese phosphate export prices, and this may make Chinese phosphate producers more cautious about buying sulphur. Indian sulphur price ideas were also heard lower on the week, and the country\\'s Q1 imports were down 3.8% despite March imports climbing 28.2% from a year earlier.\\nOCP remains out of the sulphur spot market at present as it is content with term contracts. The country’s Q1 imports climbed 8.8% on the year.\\nElsewhere, the US imported another 27,500 mt of sulphur form Kazakhstan in April, further demonstrating that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.\\nMeanwhile, Fertilizer Week published its June short-term forecast, which suggests a similar trend to the previous month’s iteration, although forecast levels are lower overall given a greater than anticipated decline in May prices.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Adnoc increases OSP to $145/mt FOB for June\\n∙KPC\\'s latest 30,000 mt tender goes at $146/mt FOB\\n∙Middle East spot reported in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\n∙Chinese domestic prices climb further\\n∙Market concerned over Indian phosphate outlook\\n∙Moroccan Q1 imports up 8.8%\\n∙US brings in further Kazakh sulphur in April\\n∙Fertilizer Week published latest short term forecast\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Further solid sulphur brought in from Kazakhstan\\nThe US imported another sulphur cargo from Kazakhstan in April, bringing in 27,500 mt from the FSU country. This further demonstrates that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.\\nMosaic’s 1 million mt/year sulphur melter at its New Wales Florida phosphate complex, planned as a way to benefit from global sulphur availability, is expected to start in Q4 2015. It will reduce the buyer’s dependency on North American suppliers of molten sulphur. In the meantime, Mosaic is expected to take advantage of\\nexisting sulphur melting facilities at Galveston, Texas, to enable it to bring in formed sulphur from overseas. After melting at Galveston, the company would use its molten carrier to transport product to Tampa.\\nThe ability to use sulphur from a wider range of sources should give buyers more negotiating power and reduce risks around availability.\\nIn 2014, the US imported 25,000 mt from Kazakhstan in July and 27,500 mt in September.

The producer again increased its own prices, with its price at Wenzhou port now RMB 1,190/mt FCA and its ex-factory price at RMB 1,170/mt FCA. In addition to lowering its production, Pugaung has successfully lowered its stock levels over recent weeks, leaving domestic supply tighter.\\nAnother driver of price increases was the higher FOB prices posted by Middle Eastern sellers and tight international availability of spot product, although this has not yet had a large effect on Chinese CFR prices.\\nMany Chinese traders had expected price declines, and so don’t currently have much stock. Although they may be willing to accept as high as $157-158/mt CFR, they would resist anything higher, as even this level leaves little margin on sales.\\nHowever, sources reported an increased willingness on the part of buyers to accept levels in the high\\n$150s/mt CFR that were still being resisted last week. One export seller even suggested that they had been told Chinese phosphate producers would be willing to pay $165/mt CFR.\\nOn the other hand, although Chinese phosphate production is relatively stable, there are concerns over export prices. Indian demand for phosphate imports is being damaged by delays in the monsoon as well as weakness in the rupee, and this is adding pressure on Chinese phosphate export prices to decrease. Phosphate producers are therefore somewhat cautious in buying sulphur.\\nLittle change was reported in crushed lump or molten sulphur.\\nInventories climbed to around 980,000 mt, and are expected to reach over 1 million mt within the coming week.\\nSome traders expect prices to reach RMB 1,250/mt FCA soon, but others believe that this view is overly optimistic.\\nJapan: April sulphur exports climb 3.5%\\nJapan’s April exports of sulphur increased 3.5% year on year to 89,357 mt, though exports for the first four months of the year were still down 6.4% at 400,726 mt.\\nThe vast majority of the tonnes, 61,756 mt, went to China.\\nOther destinations included India (11,997 mt), Indonesia (11,498 mt), and South Korea (2,717 mt).\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The current market tone is one of cautious optimism.\\nAramco posted a price of $144/mt FOB for July, up $2/mt from June. The seller then reportedly fully sold out for the month a day after finalising the price. Some in the market had been expecting a slightly higher level in the $145-148/mt FOB range, although CFR levels have not yet increased to levels that can support such a level.\\nMarket participants will be awaiting settlement of Tasweeq\\'s next 35,000 mt tender, which closes next week.\\nThere were also higher prices in China, with both domestic port prices and international prices reported higher. However, some concerns persist over Indian demand for Chinese phosphate exports weakening and a potential negative effect on sulphur demand from Chinese phosphate producers.\\nIndian prices were assessed stable with little new activity, but future business will likely have to be at higher levels given increases elsewhere.\\nJPMC\\'s latest 50,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded in the low $160s/mt CFR, up from the mid-$150s/mt CFR achieved on its previous tender.\\nEuropean Q3 contract negotiations have yet to begin, but no great change if any is expected.\\nElsewhere, Brazil\\'s May imports of sulphur plunged 37% year on year, leaving the total for the first five months roughly stable.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Aramco posts $144/mt FOB for July\\n∙Chinese prices inch up further\\n∙Tasweeq issues latest tender\\n∙JPMC tender heard in low $160s/mt CFR\\n∙Brazil\\'s May imports drop 37% on year\\n∙European Q3 contracts expected roughly stable\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: May imports plummet 37%\\nBrazil\\'s May imports of sulphur dropped 36.7% to 119,177 mt, leaving total imports for the first five months of the year roughly stable at 798,517 mt.\\nAs with previous months this year, the May volumes came mostly from Kazakhstan and the USA, which supplied 38,500 mt and 38,298 mt.\\nThe UAE supplied 37,446 mt, its highest monthly volume to Brazil since March 2012.\\nEUROPE\\nMed: Market stable but some regional variance heard\\nMediterranean prices remain assessed at $130-135/mt CFR for lots of less than 10,000 mt, though sources have indicated that prices up to the $140s/mt CFR may be achievable in Turkey.\\nSulphur burners in the region have indicated relief that sulphur prices in Q2 have been lower than in Q1, while sulphuric acid sales prices have been stable, allowing improved margins following more difficult months.\\nElsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 19,000-20,000 mt lump sulphur from the Black Sea to Abu Qir, Egypt 18-19 June.\\nEurope: No major change anticipated for Q3 contracts\\nEuropean market players mostly expect a rollover in Q3 sulphur contracts, though there are those pushing for settlements either side of this outcome.\\nSettlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.\\nSome sellers are likely to want to take advantage of current positive sentiment in global sulphur markets and push for an increase, while buyers are likely to want further decreases, as they report good availability.\\nOfficial negotiations have yet to begin, and market participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nJordan: JPMC tender heard in low $160s/mt CFR\\nJPMC\\'s latest tender for 50,000 mt, which closed June 2, was reportedly awarded in the low $160s/mt CFR.\\nThe buyer\\'s previous tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.\\nMeanwhile, it is understood that JIFCO is not currently seeking sulphur volumes. It last purchase was at $154-155/mt CFR. The JIFCO plant is currently running at around 95%.\\nElsewhere, a vessel was sought to move around 25,000 mt of granular product from Bandar Abbas, Iran to Aqaba, Jordan.\\nQatar: Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt tender\\nTasweeq\\'s latest 35,000 mt tender closes June 16, according to market sources.\\nThe seller\\'s last tender closed May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.\\nTasweeq\\'s posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.\\nSaudi Arabia: Aramco posts $144/mt FOB for July\\nAramco Trading posted a new contract price for July loading at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.\\nThe buyer has reportedly already sold out for July volumes one day after finalising the July price.\\nIt is also understood to have concluded a sale for 35,000 mt in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.\\nThe new price represents delivered prices to China around $160s/mt CFR.\\nAramco previously increased its price by $2/mt to $142/mt FOB for June.\\nThe price is further evidence of improved sentiment in global sulphur markets, but also reflects that dramatic price increases are not currently supported.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Prices unchanged on lack of fresh business\\nIndian prices continue to be assessed at $155-165/mt CFR given a lack of firm new indications, but prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable on future deals given price movements elsewhere.\\nAlthough some buyers in India pegged prices at $155-60/mt CFR, traders thought $165-168/mt CFR would be more realistic.\\nMeanwhile, RCF awarded its 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15 to MRPL, which offered at INR 8,485/mt EXW.\\nIndia: MMTC issues 15-25,000 mt sulphur tender\\nMMTC has issued a tender for 15-25,000 mt for arrival at Cochin July 6-10.\\nThe tender closed on June 9.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Domestic prices inch up further\\nDomestic prices for sulphur in China increased further this week, and there were also reports of higher prices on import business.\\nSpot offers for granular product at ports climbed to RMB 1,200-1,250/mt FCA, with transactions at around RMB 1,220/mmt FCA or above.\\nTraders were disappointed with the Aramco price for July, as they had been expecting a higher level to boost the current upward trend in prices. The $144/mt FOB price is equivalent to RMB 1220-1240/mt at port, matching current market prices.\\nPort inventories remained below 1 million mt at around 940,000 mt. Domestic producers also increased their prices.\\nSinopec\\'s Puguang increased its Wenzhou port price by RMB 10/t to RMB 1,200/mt FCA and its ex-factory price by RMB 20/mt to RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Sinopec\\'s other refineries also increased prices by RMB 20- 50/mt.\\nOn international sales, one trader concluded a deal for 50,000 mt at $159.80/mt CFR, at the upper end of the assessed range. There were also unconfirmed reports of a small cargo sold at $165/mt CFR. Sources reported bids from buyers as high as $160/mt CFR, demonsrtrating an increasing willingness to pay higher prices.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Brazilian prices also demonstrated increases, albeit limited.\\nTasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though this has yet to be confirmed.\\nIran’s IGCC sold 30,000 mt of crushed lump product at $139/mt FOB, according to sources, and will close a tender for 30,000 mt of granular material June 22.\\nPrices in China increased for domestic sales at port and for international business, with one trade as high as $164.50/mt CFR. Port inventories remained low, while several phosphate and NPK producers reported good stock levels.\\nFACT’s recent 15-25,000 mt tender was awarded at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyers’ prices ideas as low as $155/mt CFR.\\nAnglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $160/mt CFR, though some had heard\\n$155/mt CFR. At either price, the award was above Anglo’s previous tender, and still within recent weeks’\\nassessed levels of $150-160/mt CFR.\\nThe higher levels are in line with Fertilizer Week forecasts for slight increases in June and July following dramatic drops in previous weeks, as buyers held off purchasing as they awaited the bottom of the market. Market participants now report tight spot availability from Middle Eastern sellers, meaning those needing to obtain stock are having to bid slightly higher.\\nHowever, concerns persist over downstream phosphate demand, and it is not believed that fundamentals can support considerable price increases in sulphur.\\nMeanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, and is reportedly covered for requirements to late August.\\nPrices in some Mediterranean regions were pegged slightly higher, while elsewhere they were stable.\\nNegotiations for Q3 contracts across the globe are expected to have begun by next week. North African negotiations are yet to commence, with limited expectations expressed, though both sides are likely to push for price movements in the direction suited to them.\\nBrazilian buyers have indicated that they will resist any Q3 increases, and one buyer suggested they may increase their proportion of spot purchases talks result in an increase. European talks also had yet to formally commence, though no great change is expected in either direction.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Tasweeq awards tender in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\n∙Chinese business heard up to mid-$160s/mt CFR\\n∙Iran\\'s IGCC sells crushed lump in high $130s/mt FOB\\n∙FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR\\n∙Latest Anglo tender heard at $155-160/mt CFR\\n∙OCP requirements met to late August\\n∙Q3 talks in various regions to commence over coming week\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher\\nPrices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.\\nHowever, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyers plan to resist any Q3 increases\\nBrazilian buyers plan to resist increases on Q3 sulphur contracts, arguing that demand is unchanged while availability should be increasing in Q3.\\nBuyers expect nothing above Q2 levels of around $130-135/mt FOB US and $140/mt FOB Middle East\\nOne buyer suggested they may do an increased proportion of purchasing on a spot basis if contract negotiations prove too difficult.\\nMeanwhile, Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded this week at around $160/mt CFR, though other sources pegged the number as low as $155/mt CFR.\\nThis suggests Brazilian spot levels remain in the $155-160/mt CFR range, where they have been assessed for several weeks. However, prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable in the current market.\\nAnglo American was set to receive 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt from Corpu Christy via Koch May 26.\\nVale was set to receive several cargoes. Trammo was sending 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with and ETA of June 23, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival June 12.\\nOxbow was sending 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival June 30, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.\\nShell was sending 38,500 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival July 10, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 17.\\nAll of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Q3 talks yet to commence\\nSuppliers of Russian sulphur have not yet begun discussions for Q3 contracts with their consumers.\\nTalks are expected to commence later this week or early next week.\\nMeanwhile, suppliers say that their current loadings of product are going well.\\nEUROPE\\nMediterranean: Sulphur prices reported stable to higher\\nMediterranean sulphur prices remain mostly stable, although there were further signs of increases in some regions.\\nOne trader reported business in Egypt around $140/mt CFR, but with payment terms of six months.\\nThe same trader reported strong competition in Turkey from Greek and Romanian supply.\\nAnother trader reportedly obtained Libyan material in the low $130s/mt FOB and was expected to seek the mid-$140s/mt CFR in the Med region, but market players were not sure whether this would be achievable.\\nHowever, crushed lump product was reported sold in the high $130s/mt CFR Mediterranean.\\nEurope: Views differ on expected Q3 settlements\\nOpinions differed on the likely outcome for European Q3 sulphur contracts, although market players overall do not expect any great change.\\nNegotiations are expected to begin later this week.\\nSellers hope to recover some Q2 decreases, arguing that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as unfavourable for buyers as it as when Q2 levels were agreed. Relatively positive current global sentiment in sulphur markets will likely help them.\\nBut some buyers argue that further decreases are necessary, and point to good availability of product.\\nSettlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. However, it is likely that very few contracts were settled at the upper end of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.\\nMarket participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.\\nElsewhere, Neste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this week restarted production following a scheduled maintenance that began in April. It was the largest turnaround in the refinery\\'s history.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nIran: IGCC sells crushed at $139/mt FOB\\nIran’s IGCC awarded a 30,000 mt tender of crushed lump sulphur to a Chinese trader at $139/mt FOB, according to market sources.\\nThe seller will reportedly close a 30,000 mt tender for granular product on June 22.\\nQatar: Latest Tasweeq tender mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\nTasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though no firm conclusion was confirmed.\\nTraders contacted by Fertilizer Week said they bid below $146/mt FOB but were not successful.\\nSome suggested prices may be even higher.\\nThe seller\\'s last tender closed on May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.\\nTasweeq\\'s posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.\\nMorocco: Q3 talks in early stages; OCP out of spot\\nNegotiations for Q3 Moroccan sulphur contracts are still in their early stages, and parties are reluctant to disclose expected settlements at this point.\\nMeanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, as the buyer is reportedly fully covered till the end of August.\\nElsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 20,000 mt of granular sulphur from the Black Sea port of Poti to either Jorf Lasfar or Safi.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR\\nFACT’s June 10 tender for 15-25,000 mt sulphur for delivery to Cochin July 6-10 was awarded to Swiss Singapore at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyer price ideas of $155-160/mt CFR.\\nRecent business to CIL was also reported in the mid-$160s/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Prices continue gradual uptick\\nChinese prices climbed further this week, although market action was fairly limited on a lack of speculative activity. Most buying was for downstream users.\\nSpot price at ports rose to RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, up RMB 20/mt on the week.\\nPort inventories dropped to around 900,000 mt but rebounded to 930,000 mt by June 18.\\nInternational offers were in the $160s/mt CFR, being driven up by reported relatively tight availability of MIddle Eastern product.\\nSome reported bids from Chinese buyers in the low-mid-$160s/mt CFR and one trader said they had concluded a sale of 35,000 mt ex-Middle East at $164.50/mt CFR this week.\\nCrushed lump in some cases was close to $150/mt CFR, but some reported crushed lump prices still as low as $138/mt CFR.\\nAmong domestic producers, Sinopec’s Puguang was quoting RMB 1,200/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Its inventory levels are 15,000 mt at port and 20,000 mt at plant, indicating little pressure on pricing.\\nSome large phosphate & NPK producers in Hubei said they built stock when offers were in the low $150s/mt CFR and some paid in the low $130s/mt CFR for lump product. Therefore, although port inventories declined, the stock levels in plants increased in some cases.\\nElsewhere, there was a gathering of sulphur traders in Nanjing on June 18, hosted by Bohai Commodity Exchange. The exchange, based in Tianjin in Northern China, has provided an electronic platform for spot trading of sulphur from July 2013. It is now encouraging major sulphur importers and large phosphate producers to transact on the platform.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Domestic port prices, as well as prices from Puguang, declined further and CFR price ideas followed suit. Elsewhere, trade data showed that Chinese February imports declined 7% on the year, though they remained a relatively healthy level considering the Spring Festival during that month.\\nA similar situation was apparent in India, with no new demand or spot activity reported. However, on the sell side, Reliance announced its latest 27,000 mt tender.\\nEuropean contract talks for Q2 liquid sulphur continued, with buyers and sellers respectively pushing for similar-sized decreases and increases. A range of refinery maintenances has attributed to sellers’ confidence, while the strength of the dollar versus the euro is a key reason for buyers’ desired decrease.\\nMediterranean price also remained under pressure, although limited availability from refinery turnarounds in the region has put a floor on price declines.\\nSimilarly, OCP was pushing for lower spot prices in Morocco, and is expected to achieve a decrease on its Q2 contract price.\\nHighlights of the week:\\nChina imports 793,658 mt in February\\nChinese spot prices down further\\nReliance issues latest sales tender\\nViews split on European contract outcome\\nClarity awaited from OSP and QSP next week\\nSulphur Export Tenders: Shipment Jan 2015-Feb 2015\\nSULPHUR | 2\\nSulphur Import Tenders: Shipment Dec 2014-Mar 2015\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nSULPHUR | 3\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nEUROPE\\nEuropean contract direction debated\\nDifferences of opinion persisted over the likely outcome of negotiations for European Q2 liquid sulphur contracts.\\nWhile sellers are pushing for a $10-15/mt increase, buyers are pushing for a decrease of a similar size. Non-negotiating market players therefore believe that a rollover is likely.\\nSellers argue that there is not much availability of sulphur for the coming months and this should push prices up. But buyers argue that exchange rate fluctuations mean that their dollar payments should decrease to protect margins while their euro-denominated incomings remain stable.\\nTraders viewed the market as balanced, though closer to tight than long.\\nA range of European refinery turnarounds are expected to keep the market from moving long, with production outages across oil refineries in Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean.\\nRefineries currently in or soon to begin maintenance included Mineraloelraffinerie Oberrhein (MIRO), Germany’s largest refinery, in Karlsruhe; Shell\\'s refinery in Pernis, The Netherlands, which is Europe’s largest; ExxonMobil’s refinery in Port Jerome, France; and the Isab refinery in Italy, 80%-owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG.\\nWork on Total’s Donges refinery in France was postponed to May from March, and is now scheduled to take place from May 4 to June\\n25.Total’s Lindsey UK refinery also recently underwent maintenance.\\nEarlier in March, the Pernis facility announced a planned turnaround that will last to late May.\\nSubsequently, Neste said its refinery in Porvoo, Finland, would start the largest turnaround in the refinery\\'s history in April.\\nMaintenance at Mediterranean facilities also appears to be ramping up. In addition to the Isab maintenance, Greece\\'s Aspropyrgos facility will go offline for scheduled maintenance from mid-April.\\nITALY\\nMediterranean prices inch down but availability limited\\nSulphur prices in the Mediterranean region remained under downwards pressure, though relatively tight supply meant that price decreases were limited.\\nSources pegged spot prices in the $135-140/mt CFR range, as buyers push for lower levels while prices decline elsewhere.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nBut the current turnaround at the Isab refinery in Priolo, Italy, 80% owned by Lukoil and 20% owned by ERG, and the upcoming turnaround at the Apropyrgos refinery in Greece are keeping availability limited.\\nOn the other hand, sources report offers of both prilled and crushed product from Russia on the Black Sea.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMOROCCO\\nMoroccan Q2 talks underway\\nNorth African contracts for Q2 purchases of sulphur are underway, and sources suggest that a decrease from the $160-165/mt CFR seems likely.\\nThe scale of a possible decrease was yet to be determined.\\nA buy-side source suggested spot purchases had been achieved around $150/mt CFR and could likely be achieved below this level, though such traded levels have yet to be confirmed.\\nQATAR\\nTraders expect Barzan sales in April; Tasweeq QSP coming soon\\nMarket sources suggested that the Barzan gas processing plant in Qatar may begin shipping product in April, though producer sources did not confirm.\\nThe plant is expected to increase Qatar\\'s sulphur production to 2.64 million mt in 2015 from 2.25 million mt the previous year.\\nAs previously reported, market sources said that Tasweeq’s most recent tender for 35,000 mt was awarded in the mid-$150s/mt FOB, with some suggesting prices below $150/mt FOB, though the seller did not confirm. In fact, one source suggested that the seller had scrapped the tender and attributed the scrapping to availability issues. The tender closed on March 17.\\nTasweeq is likely to announce its QSP for April on March 30.\\nSULPHUR | 4\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nUAE\\nAdnoc OSP due mid-week; Shah to commission end-Q2\\nAdnoc’s Shah project in the UAE is expected to be fully commissioned by the end of Q2 2015, according to a company source.\\nSome traders suggested it would start exports in April, but it is unlikely that consistent volumes will be available prior to full commissioning.\\nThe project is forecast to be the largest coming on-stream in 2015, and will be one of the key contributors to market supply moving long over the next few years. It was previously delayed from Q1 to Q2.\\nAdnoc is expected to announce its official selling price for April around April 1.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nINDIA\\nReliance issues latest 27,000 mt tender\\nReliance issued its latest sales tender for 27,000 mt of sulphur with a laycan of April 15-19, with Port Bedi as loadport.\\nThe tender closes on March 30.\\nThe seller’s previous 27,000 mt that closed on March 9 was reportedly awarded to a Chinese trader in the $158-160/mt FOB Sikka range, well down from its tender in February, which was for 40,000 mt and was awarded around $180/mt FOB Sikka to a Chinese trader.\\nRCF has reportedly not decided on any award for its 5,000 mt sulphur tender that closed on March 10.\\nElsewhere, the Indian market was quiet with limited demand.\\nSulphur Arrivals: Jan-Mar 2015\\nSULPHUR | 5\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChinese February sulphur imports decline over Spring Festival\\nChina’s February imports of sulphur declined 7% year on year to 793,658 mt, though the total for the first two months was still up as a result of the strong January volume.\\nImports were expected to be somewhat lower than usual because of the Spring Festival falling in late February, leaving the market and ports mostly inactive for much of the second half of the month.\\nSaudi Arabia was by far the largest source of February imports, supplying 218,171 mt.\\nOther key suppliers were South Korea with 95,492 mt, Kazakhstan with 91,472 mt, Qatar with 90,364 mt, Japan with 75,822 mt, and the US with 61,497 mt.\\nIran supplied on 46,502 mt, having been the source of more than 90,000 mt in every month since June 2014.\\nQatar’s 90,364 mt was the largest monthly volume from the country since August 2014, while India’s 43,813 mt was the largest since July 2014.\\nChinese market quiet as prices pressured downwards\\nSulphur market activity in China was limited, as buyers held off making purchases in anticipation of lower prices.\\nPrices at ports decreased to RMB 1,280-1,340/mt FCA, with the lower end of the range at Nantong and Zhenjiang and the higher end at Fangcheng.\\nSulphur stocks at ports declined to around 0.99 million mt, down considerably over the week. However, major buyers currently have ample stocks at plants, though they are likely to require replenishing soon.\\nImporters were reportedly negotiating for business at $165-170/mt CFR.\\nSinopec’s Puguang moved down its price at Wanzhao port to RMB 1,300/mt FCA and its plant price to RMB 1,150/mt EXW. The operating rate of the refinery has been around two thirds of its average in 2014, with output around 4,000 mt/day. The plant inventory declined to around 70,000 mt from 80,000-90,000 mt but there was still pressure from high stocks at port.\\nSULPHUR | 6\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7811 145370\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nCopyright notice:\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

India’s Q1 imports were up 22.6% at 282,717 mt, following a 77.6% year-on-year increase in March volumes.\\nBut although Asian spot prices have increased recently, they are still not high enough to attract export sales interest from Two Lions, which is focused on the more attractive domestic market where prices have also been rising as a result of maintenance turnarounds.\\nThe Chilean market remains quiet with a lack of spot activity. Most sources pegged prices at $80-85/mt CFR, saying that some interest was starting to surface, but others said that anything above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Chile’s April imports dropped 26% on the year, leaving total imports to date down slightly.\\nEuropean spot prices were stable, with little new business this week and disputes on true notional levels. The most recent traded levels are in line with prices of the past several months, although reports that last week’s sales to Argentina went in the mid-$80s/mt CFR out of Antwerp suggested that the tendency may be downwards rather than upwards.\\nMorocco is still absent from the spot market, though a buyer source suggested that offer levels from Europe were declining. Trade data showed that the country’s Q1 imports were up by nearly a third, though it is still unlikely that its total 2015 imports will reach the level of the previous year.\\nMeanwhile, Fertilizer Week\\'s short term forecast for June displayed little change from the previous month\\'s iteration, with global prices not expected to change much throughout the forecast period, though there is greater uncertainty over the later months in the forecast.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Asian FOB spot prices rise further\\n∙Indian spot demand persists into $70s/mt CFR\\n∙Indian Q1 imports climb after strong March\\n∙Two Lions focused on domestic market\\n∙Chilean spot market quiet with prices pegged around $80/mt CFR\\n∙Chile\\'s April imports plunge\\n∙Morocco sticks to term contracts but reports lower offers\\n∙Fertilizer Week publishes latest short term forecast\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals prices reached their lowest levels since mid-April, or in the case of copper since March, before recovering slightly later in the week but remaining below last week\\'s levels. Reported macroeconomic indicators were relatively weak, and concerns are still evident over both Chinese weakness and a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. LME copper was down to $5,991.50/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nThere is more smoke than fire in US phosphate and even global phosphate trade this week. Mosaic has taken a more aggressive stance on US domestic DAP pricing this week. This supports expectations that the US phosphate giant intends to continue running as close to capacity as it can over the summer.\\nFurther signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand and its likely effect on Chinese phosphates exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: April sulphuric acid imports climb 28%\\nUS imports of sulphuric acid for April climbed 28.2% year on year to 291,283 mt, leaving imports for the first four months up 8.4% at 1.12 million mt.\\nAlthough the majority of the April imports came from Canada, which supplied 159,993 mt, and much of the remainder came from Mexico, which supplied 58,001 mt, the US continued to increase its imports from Europe.\\nFor April, Finland supplied 18,902 mt, Belgium supplied 18,121 mt, Germany supplied 18,058 mt, and Poland supplied 17,451 mt.\\nCanada: April sulphuric acid exports up 2.5%\\nCanada’s April exports of sulphuric acid climbed 2.5% year on year, but imports for the first four months of the year were still down 0.9% at 643,504 mt.\\nEffectively all of the tonnes went to the US.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nChile: April acid imports plunge 26%\\nChile\\'s April imports of sulphuric acid dropped 25.8% year on year to 176,276 mt, leaving imports for the first four months of the year down 2.2% at 778,487 mt.\\nMost of the April tonnes came from Peru, which supplied 104,130 mt, with the remainder coming from Brazil and Japan, which supplied 40,631 mt and 31,419 mt respectively.\\nThese same three countries supplied almost all of Chile’s February and March imports too.\\nChile: Spot market quiet and notional levels disputed\\nThe spot sulphuric acid market in Chile remains quiet, with no new business reported this week.\\nAlthough most sources continue notionally to peg prices at $80-90/mt CFR, with the majority at the lower end of this range, others argue that this is unrealistic, with some in Chile suggesting that any sales above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Indeed, some traders have suggested that recent business has been much closer to the $80/mt CFR.\\nThere is little sign of an increase in Chilean spot demand, but with fewer tonnes leaving Mexico and Peruvian exports also likely to inch down, buyers may be more active in the spot market in H2.\\nPeru: March sulphuric acid exports down 8.5%\\nPeru’s March exports of sulphuric acid declined 8.5% year on year to 139,710 mt, although this was the largest monthly volume of exports since the previous March.\\nTotal exports for Q1 at 330,087 mt were also down 8.5% on the year.\\nAlmost all of the tonnes for March and the whole of Q1 went to Chile, other than 1,554 mt to Panama in March.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot export prices remain stable\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained pegged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little firm indication of business outside this range.\\nAlthough some sources suggested that prices as high as $38/mt FOB would now be realistic, while others suggested that even prices in the $30s/mt FOB would be difficult to obtain, recent reported trades have remained at similar levels for several months.\\nHowever, some sources suggested that last week’s sale to Argentina, which was previously thought to be in the $90s/mt CFR, was in fact bought at $85/mt CFR for loading from Antwerp.\\nTurkey: Q1 sulphuric acid imports down 8%\\nTurkey’s sulphuric acid imports for Q1 2015 declined 8% year on year to 142,447 mt.\\nAlmost all of the Q1 tonnes came from Aurubis\\'s Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, although 7,569 mt came from Italy.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Q1 sulphuric acid imports climb 31%\\nMorocco’s Q1 imports of sulphuric acid were up 30.8% year on year at 244,767 mt, demonstrating a strong start to the year.\\nThe imports were split between a range of European countries, with Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium the biggest suppliers, while Italy, Sweden, Norway and Germany made up the remainder.\\nMorocco’s imports for 2015 are still overall expected to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nThe country is forecast to continue importing sulphuric acid in 2015 as OCP conducts upgrade work across its installed capacity. Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility. CRU forecasts acid import demand at 590,000 mt in 2015.\\nMorocco: Spot quiet but offer levels heard declining\\nMoroccan spot sulphuric business has been quiet, as OCP has mainly been focused on term contracts and has offered little spot enquiry in recent weeks, market sources said.\\nHowever, a buyer source suggested that offers for spot sulphuric acid have declined $5-10/mt in recent weeks, and that current published Northwest European spot prices are above offer levels to North Africa.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Spot demand persists\\nIndian spot demand for sulphuric acid remained firm, with most pegging prices in the $60-70/mt CFR range and some reports of recent business as high as the mid-$70s/mt CFR.\\nSources suggested that Indian buyers are having to cover product that was expected but has not been available due to Asian tightness. It is understood that delays in the startup of PPL’s sulphur burner have also\\nled to greater spot requirements, and some suggest this will persist to October, though the buyer has yet to confirm.\\nCRU currently forecasts stable sulphuric acid output from PPL this year and next at 660,000 mt/year, though this is expected to rise to 1.02 million mt/year in 2017 and 1.4 million mt/year thereafter.\\nIndia: Sulphuric acid imports jump 78%\\nIndia’s sulphuric acid imports for March climbed 77.6% to 100,300 mt, leaving Q1 imports up 22.6% at 282,717 mt.\\nSouth Korea was the source of 39,231 mt, while Japan supplied 26,970 mt.\\nOf the remaining tonnes, 19,493 mt came from the Philippines, 8,002 mt came from North Korea, and 6,600 mt came from Taiwan.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Two Lions not exporting as Chinese prices climb\\nTwo Lions is not currently considering spot exports of sulphuric acid, as domestic Chinese prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.\\nSulphuric acid prices in China climbed a further RMB 10-20/mt in several regional markets over the past week. Inner Mongolia has seen increases of around RMB 20/mt as several smelters have shutdowns in the May-June period. This affects Hubei province too as they buy acid from Inner Mongolia.\\nIn Jiangsu, where Two Lions is located, sulphur burners have also increased prices because of short upcoming maintenances.\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot prices climb on tightness, Indian demand\\nEast Asian spot prices for sulphuric acid exports have been reported higher by several sources, with business reaching $30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and one trader suggesting that deals had been done even higher.\\nSome sources continued to peg the upper end of the price range at $25/mt FOB.\\nTight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to pay more in many cases.\\nThe lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc’s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc’s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days, though the length has yet to be confirmed.\\nJapan: April sulphuric acid exports drop 10%\\nJapan’s April exports of sulphuric acid declined 9.9% year on year to 213,739 mt, leaving exports for the first four months of the year down 5.8% at 926,166 mt.\\nThe Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 86,976 mt of the April tonnes.\\nIndia was the next largest importer, taking 56,174 mt.\\nThailand took 26,159 mt, Australia took 21,999 mt, and Chile took 10,503 mt. The volume to Thailand is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since February 2014.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Registered in England No 940750.\\nRegistered Office: Charles House, 108-110 Finchley Road, London, NW3 5JJ.\\nTel: + 44 20 7903 2000 Fax: +44 20 7837 0976\\nwww.crugroup.com11 June | 2015\\nANALYSIS\\nAcid market remains stable, limited changes seen in H2\\nSulphuric acid players at this week\\'s ESA conference in Malaga saw the market as mostly stable, with limited changes expected in H2.\\nMost believed that European availability is better than had been thought, as buyers seeking volumes in recent months have had no problems finding tonnes without any apparent upward pressure on prices.\\nAsia on the other hand continues to be seen as relatively tight, although some sources suggested that availability in this region is also better than many believe. Nonetheless, recent business has been reported as high as the low $30s/mt FOB Japan/South Korea.\\nFor European sellers looking at the remainder of the year, Moroccan demand is likely to be lower than it has been in the first half of the year, but US and Brazilian business are likely to remain firm. US imports have been strong so far this year, even though spot activity has been limited. Trade data showed that despite a 47% year on year drop in May volumes Brazilian imports for the first five months of the year were still up 39%.\\nNamibian import demand is expected to persist through this year and potentially into 2016 too.\\nTurkish demand and prices remain relatively stable and are likely to remain roughly so over the coming months.\\nAlthough discussions for Q3 European contracts have yet to formally begin, no major changes, if any, are expected.\\nFor Asian sellers, India remains a key source of marginal demand and is likely to continue buying in Q3, though potentially with less urgency than in recent months.\\nSome increase in Chilean spot activity is expected in H2, but most demand is believed to be met by contractual volumes.\\nSources continue to see Mexico as a key supplier of marginal tonnes to Chile, even though its monthly exports are expected to decline from next month.\\nChinese import business has been far lower than in 2014, but it is believed that the country could absorb more tonnes if needed.\\nMarket participants are awaiting the restart of the PASAR smelter in the Philippines to see how much acid it will produce and what effect this may have on the market. Trade data showed that the smelter\\'s running brought up Q1 2015 exports from the Philippines to 58,200 mt from nothing a year earlier.\\nOverall, both European and Asian FOB prices are expected to be slightly lower in H2, but any declines are expected to be small\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Market remains stable with only minor changes expected in H2\\n∙East Asian sales reported into $30s/mt FOB Japan/South Korea\\n∙European Q3 contracts expected roughly stable\\n∙Brazilian May imports down 47% on year but still up 39% YTD\\n∙Indian demand continues\\n∙Philippines Q1 exports reach 58,200 mt\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals slipped as LME copper posted its biggest loss since January as amid rising supplies. Stockpiles monitored by the LME have increased 90% in the past year, and on June 10 incresed by the most since March, or 3.1%. LME 3-month settled $150 lower at $5,880/mt.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nDespite the sharp decline in Mosaic\\'s export activity over the last couple of weeks, there are plenty of reasons to expect the company to use all of the sulphuric acid it produces. It will be loading panamax cargos of DAP to meet contractual obligations in India through July. In addition, the producer likely will load a panamax per month to India to supply its own system in that country through the summer and into the fall. Even though the US domestic fill season may be disappointing compared to prior years due to falling crop values, Mosaic has extensive consignment agreements with domestic distributors.\\nThe sulphur market demonstrated further price rises without signs of dramatic increases. The current market tone is one of cautious optimism. Aramco posted a price of $144/mt FOB for July, up $2/mt from June. The seller then reportedly fully sold out for the month a day after finalising the price. Some in the market had been expecting a slightly higher level in the $145-148/mt FOB range, although CFR levels have not yet increased to levels that can support such a level. Market participants will be awaiting settlement of Tasweeq\\'s next 35,000 mt tender, which closes next week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nMexico: Boleo remains key source of tonnes\\nMarket participants have continued to note the important effect that sulphuric acid export volumes from the Boleo mine in Mexico have had on the global market, and expect it to remain an important contributor, although volumes are expected to decline over coming months.\\nChilean buyers, in particular, have seen it as an important alternative to East Asian supplies, as Chilean imports from Mexico increased from 58,159 mt over the whole of 2014 to 117,871 mt over just the first four months of 2015.\\nBut, as previously reported, Boleo\\'s exports of sulphuric acid out of Santa Rosalia port are likely to decline from July onwards.\\nIt has exported around two cargoes of 18-20,000 mt per month so far this year, but this is likely to decline to around one cargo per month from July as it ramps up its plant.\\nBoleo began producing copper January 17, and has been a key source of marginal acid supply, with most cargoes going to Chile, although some material has gone to Brazil.\\nUS: Spot quiet but overall volumes strong\\nThe US sulphuric acid import spot market remains relatively quiet, although volumes to the country have been high.\\nMarket participants continue to peg spot prices in the $70-80/mt CFR range.\\nContractual business has been strong, and deals that have been done in recent months have in many cases been concluded directly between buyers and sellers with no trader intermediary.\\nUS buyers have resisted price increases as current availability for volumes both domestically and from overseas has not been excessively tight.\\nBut the country\\'s overseas imports are expected to continue increasing over the coming years as availability from neighbouring Canada declines. As previously reported, US imports for the first four months of this year were up 8.4% from the same period last year at 1.12 million mt. Although the majority came from Canada and much of the remainder from Mexico, the US has continued to increase the proportion of its imports coming from Europe.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Imports down in May but still up YTD\\nBrazil\\'s sulphuric acid imports for May fell 46.7% year on year to 30,729 mt, but total imports for the first five months of the year remained 39% higher on the year at 242,491 mt.\\nSpain was the main source of May volumes, supplying 14,991 mt, while the remainder came from Sweden (8,925 mt) and Belgium (6,811 mt).\\nSpot import prices to Brazil remain pegged at $85-90/mt CFR, and spot sales to the country have been in the $80s/mt CFR for several months.\\nChile: Spot activity lacking, term volumes meet demand\\nThe Chilean spot market remains quiet, as most demand has been met by contractual volumes and some sellers have likely been displaced by new volumes from Mexico.\\nSpot enquiry is expected to pick up slightly in the second half of the year, though it is not yet clear how much of buyers\\' requirements have not been met by contracts.\\nSources peg notional spot prices at a similar level to contracts of around $80/mt CFR, though some buyers have argued that this would not be achievable and prices would more likely be around $75/mt CFR. However, such levels would be difficult to obtain given high East Asian FOB levels and high production costs for sulphur burners such as the one in Mexico.\\nThe spot assessment remains $80-85/mt, with the higher end of $90/mt CFR having recently been brought down as it is not believed that spot business close to this level has been achieved in recent weeks, and what limited spot business has been reported this quarter is understood to have been around $80/mt CFR or slightly higher.\\nChilean imports for 2015, including volumes from neighbouring Peru, are expected to total 2.4-2.5 million mt, up from last year\\'s 2.25 milllion mt.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: FOB spot levels steady, fundamentals balanced\\nEuropean spot prices continue to be assessed at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little change in prices reported over the past several months.\\nSome have suggested business in the high $30s/mt FOB, but this is unlikely to be representative given stable CFR prices over recent months across countries that import European tonnes, and even lower prices in some cases, with recent business to Argentina reported in the mid-$80s/mt CFR.\\nDespite repeated reports of tight availability, buyers have had no difficulty obtaining desired spot cargoes, leaving little impetus for any price climbs.\\nThe only recent turnarounds have been at Boliden\\'s Harjavalta and Kokkola smelters in Finland. The producer is also planning a turnaround at its Rönnskär plant in September, with the only other European smelter turnaround currently on the horizon in the region is Atlantic Copper\\'s Huelva site in September.\\nIn Q2 2016, Aurubis is expected to shut down its smelter in Pirdorp, Bulgaria smelter for around two months, though this is likely to be at least partially offset by increased production at its Hamburg site.\\nAs reported in Fertilizer Week\\'s most recent short term forecast, published last week, European FOB levels are expected to inch down in H2, but the decline is expected to be limited, with prices remaining mostly in the $20s/mt FOB by the end of the year.\\nTurkey: Demand and prices reported stable\\nTurkish demand for sulphuric acid is expected to remain relatively stable over the remainder of the year and in 2016, with new demand offsetting demand that is exiting the market.\\nAlthough Toros\\'s new sulphur burner is expected to reduce demand for acid imports, this is likely to be offset by a similar volume of new demand from the Meta Nickel plant.\\nSources report that Meta Nickel has already been purchasing imports of sulphuric acid, though it will be some time before it reaches capacity.\\nThe new capacity at Gordes in Turkey is forecast by CRU to boost nickel-leaching based acid demand to around 50,000 mt in 2015, gradually increasing to 190,000 mt by 2018.\\nSpot prices remain pegged at $40-50/mt CFR Turkey, though sources suggest that most business would be at the upper end of this range.\\nTurkey: April imports up 69% year on year\\nTurkey’s April imports of sulphuric acid increased 68.8% year on year to 53,809 mt, bringing imports for the first four months up 5.1% at 196,256 mt.\\nThe increase has offset the low volumes of previous months. As reported last week, Q1 imports were down 8%.\\nAlmost all of the April tonnes came from Aurubis\\'s Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, with only 950 mt from Italy and 485 mt from Germany.\\nEurope: Q3 contracts expected relatively stable\\nMost market participants currently expect a rollover or a slight increase on Q3 European contracts for sulphuric acid.\\nSome argue that the weak euro has hurt sulphur burners who buy their sulphur in dollars but sell their acid in euros\\nSome have also argued that current export spot prices of $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe are offering more attractive netbacks than European contract levels.\\nContracts for Q2 were assessed at €57-80/mt CFR, and have been at a similar level for over a year, with only slight increases of around €2-3/mt at the lower end of the range over that period. It is worth noting that the upper end of the range is not representative of standard business.\\nBut many in the market continue to think that a rollover remains the most likely outcome, as both buyers and sellers are relatively satisfied with current levels and market fundamentals in the region have not changed much recently and are not expected to change much over Q3.\\nEven those expecting an increase believe that only a single-digit rise would be achievable. Official discussions have yet to begin.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNamibia: European sellers confident of demand\\nNamibian demand for sulphuric acid imports from Europe is expected to continue through 2015 with some demand likely in 2016, though after this it is likely to reduce to negligible levels.\\nThere is concern that the startup of Dundee Precious Metals\\' Tsumeb sulphuric acid plant in June may further diminish demand for European imports, but export sellers say that Namibian buyers have indicated that they do not expect supply for Tsumeb until 2016, and that buyers are likely to take some European tonnes even after they begin consuming volumes from Tsumeb.\\nCRU forecasts sulphuric acid supply from the plant of around 140,000 mt in 2015, with this increasing to 310,000 mt/year from 2016.\\nDundee Precious Metals entered a supply agreement with Rössing Uranium for the annual purchase of 225,000 t/year of sulphuric acid. Other supply agreements are currently under negotiation with Weatherly International and Protea Chemicals.\\nThe plant will therefore remove the requirement for Rössing to import acid from 2017 at the latest, leaving one less outlet for exporters.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Spot demand still strong\\nDemand from India for spot sulphuric acid cargoes remains strong, according to market sources.\\nSpot price ideas are mostly in the $60-70/mt CFR range, although traders suggested that prices would be higher for smaller cargoes to more difficult ports. However, some Indian buyers reported weaker buying interest and suggested price ideas in the $50-55/mt CFR range.\\nPPL\\'s sulphur burner in Paradip is expected to be delayed until September-October, and market participants believe this will support Indian demand, though many expect a gradual decline from the recent high levels of prompt demand.\\nThere is currently a backlog of six cargoes arriving in India in June, according to traders.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nPhilippines: Q1 exports reach 58,200 mt\\nThe Philippines exported 58,200 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1, trade data show, up from nothing in Q1 2014.\\nOf the total, 49,800 mt was exported in February with the remainder in March. All of the 8,400 mt exported in March went to Malaysia. Of the February total, 22,000 mt went to Indonesia, 16,800 mt went to Malaysia, and 11,000 mt went to Australia.\\nAs previously reported, exports of sulphuric acid from the Philippines climbed to 317,732 mt in 2014 from 98,387 mt in 2013. Exports from the country have begun to play a larger role in the regional trade dynamic as Glencore\\'s PASAR smelter has operated while adjacent consumer Philphos has remained closed.\\nThe PASAR copper smelter shut on April 16 for an estimated 60 days of planned maintenance and work to increase capacity.\\nChina: Market quiet but firm prices reported\\nMarket participants reported decent import demand for sulphuric acid to China, although activity this year has been lower than in 2014.\\nPrice ideas were in the $30s/mt CFR, though no recent trades were confirmed.\\nTwo Lions is currently focused on Chinese sales, as domestic prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.\\nPreviously, the seller has achieved prices into the $50s/mt FOB when buyers have needed to cover prompt requirements and have been unable to obtain product elsewhere.\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot prices strong amid tightness\\nAsian spot prices for exports remain assessed at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, and there has been some business reported slightly above this level, though it has yet to be confirmed.\\nSouth Korean producers reportedly recently sold 120,000 mt to traders for H2 at prices from the high $20s/mt FOB to the low $30s/mt FOB.\\nTight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to accept higher prices in some cases.\\nThe lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand. Relatively high Chinese import prices in the $30s/mt CFR were also reported.\\nIt is believed that $20/mt FOB is now the floor for East Asian spot exports.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi\\'s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko\\'s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc\\'s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc\\'s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.\\nMuch uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts.\\nLater in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The buyer continues to wait for the startup of a refinery that was expected to help meet its acid requirements. In addition, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender.\\nIt is yet to be revealed whether European FOB and Brazilian CFR prices have changed at all from their stable levels of recent months, and these deals should provide further indications.\\nMorocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced to as low as 30,000 mt/month and these requirements can be met by current long-term contracts.\\nIn Asia, Indian spot prices continue to be pegged in the high $60s/mt CFR as demand from the country persists. Reports of a purchase by PPL in the low $50s/mt CFR were attributed to a swap whereby the buyer will have to resell the product at the same price, suggesting that the price is not representative of true spot levels.\\nChinese import prices were also reportedly firm at $30-40/mt CFR, roughly in line with domestic prices.\\nElsewhere, South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt. Record monthly volumes went to Thailand and Vietnam.\\n∙Petrobras seeks offers for 60,000 mt\\n∙Mosaic closes latest 12,000 mt tender\\n∙OCP reports lower spot requirement for coming months\\n∙Indian demand still firm in $60s/mt CFR\\n∙PPL reportedly gets tonnes on deal swap\\n∙South Korea\\'s May exports double on record SE Asian volumes\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals fell further over the course of the week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit weighed heavily on prices. Some metals were seen as oversold, and a weakening dollar also offered hopes for some stability. LME copper was down to $5,748/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nIn theory summer spot phosphate cargoes should be lining up for the US Gulf, but there are no substantial volumes committed outside of a part cargo expected from EuroChem this month. This leaves Mosaic with little else to do but to run its plants and fill its consignment warehouses in the US interior, keeping all of its sulphuric acid in house. Meanwhile, the working assumption is that PotashCorp\\'s closure of its sulphuric acid unit at Geismar, Louisiana, was accounted for by the market in prior months, but those expectations will be tested in coming weeks and months.\\nGlobal spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq\\'s latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were largely unchanged and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras seeking 60,000 mt\\nPetrobras is seeking 60,000 mt of sulphuric acid towards its annual requirements, with bids due by June 23, sources said.\\nPetrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.\\nMeanwhile, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender June 18, though no prices were yet disclosed. The tonnes are for August delivery.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot stable and contracts yet to finalise\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained stable at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with a lack of new reported business.\\nUpcoming Brazilian sales will give a clearer indication of any possible movement from price levels that have been stable for several months.\\nMoroccan spot demand is lacking, and although overall volumes to the US are strong, spot business has been limited.\\nMeanwhile, further indications of Q3 European contracts have yet to be revealed, although no great change is expected from Q2 levels.\\nSweden: Q1 exports up 6.1% despite March drop\\nSweden exported 120,006 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1 2015, up 6.1% year on year despite a 54.5% drop in March volumes.\\nNorway, Finland, the US and Morocco remained the four largest destinations for Q1, though their relative shares altered slightly.\\nCuba took 10,500 mt after not receiving any volumes from Sweden in Q1 2014.\\nSpain: Q1 exports climb 31%\\nSpain’s sulphuric acid exports for Q1 were up 30.8% at 265,621 mt.\\nChile has been the key destination for tonnes, taking 59,020 mt compared with 38,206 mt in Q1 2014.\\nThe volumes going to Morocco increased to 49,955 mt from 12,602 mt, while tonnes to Cuba increased to 40,375 mt from 10,474 mt.\\nThe US was the destination for 19,003 mt, up from nothing in Q1 2014.\\nBrazil, on the other hand, received only 15,019 mt of Spain’s Q1 exports, down from 60,967 mt.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP requirements currently met by contracts\\nMorocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.\\nThe buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is suggested that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.\\nCRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nMorocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand still firm; PPL gets product in swap\\nIndian demand remained firm, with prices pegged mostly in the $65-70/mt CFR range.\\nPPL reportedly obtained a cargo from Japan, with prices reported in the $50s/mt CFR, surprising many market participants. However, one source suggested the deal was a swap whereby the consumer will have to resell the same volume to the seller at the same price at a later date.\\nGood demand from the SSP sector in India is supportive of prices, especially on the west coast.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot prices steady\\nEast Asian spot prices for export remain stable at an assessment of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with most recent business falling within this range.\\nIndian demand remains a key supporter of spot prices, with some smaller spot enquiries from Vietnam.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi\\'s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko\\'s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc\\'s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc\\'s Onsan smelter shut on May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.\\nMuch uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. The plant has not yet resumed output.\\nLater in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.\\nChina: Import prices pegged $30-40/mt CFR\\nSources continued to peg spot prices for Chinese sulphuric acid imports in the $30-40/mt CFR range.\\nAcid prices in southern China were reported at RMB 360/mt for industrial use, but Jinchuan Copper’s Fancheng smelter was selling at RMB 240/mt, roughly equivalent to the $40/mt CFR import price in the region, sources said.\\nNetbacks for exports to India from southern China were pegged below $30/mt FOB, making them unattractive for domestic producers.\\nSouth Korea: May exports double; records to SE Asia\\nSouth Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt.\\nOf the May tonnes 70,339 mt went to China, meaning it remained the largest destination for South Korean exports, though this was the smallest monthly volume South Korea has sent there since December.\\nIndia took 67,736 mt, Thailand took 46,748 mt and Chile took 46,646 mt.\\nThe Thailand volume is the largest monthly volume from South Korea to that country on record dating back to at least 1997.\\nVietnam took 19,038 mt, and this was the largest volume on record to that country too.\\nA cargo of 25,300 mt went to Mexico, and this is believed to be from the previously reported LS Nikko combi vessel tender.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Prices to there have been unchanged for several months, with Mosaic’s recent 12,000 mt tender reportedly awarded in the mid- $80s/mt CFR. Meanwhile, Petrobras has indicated that it will decide on its 60,000 mt tender on Friday July 3, though whether it takes all, some, or none of the total volume at this stage will likely depend on offer levels.\\nMorocco is not currently active on the spot market due to its reduced acid requirement, though sellers are confident the buyer would consider buying if a deal were sufficiently attractive.\\nThe US has remained absent from the spot market.\\nEuropean Q3 contracts were reported at a rollover, in line with expectations.\\nIn the other key spot export market of East Asia, prices also seemed likely to dip pending any unexpected surprises.\\nAlthough no firm indications have yet suggested a decline in the $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, at least the upper end of this range seems unlikely to be achieved given current spot demand levels.\\nIndian buyers have reduced their prompt requirements and their prices ideas, and the upcoming FACT tender will give a better indication of current levels. One trader suggested prices to India as low as $10-16/mt FOB Japan, but other market participants were dismissive of such levels.\\nThe Chilean spot market remains quiet, and market participants are waiting to see if demand there surfaces.\\nOther potentially market-moving events in the near future will be the restart of PASAR, likely within the next couple of weeks, and Fertinal’s requirement for three cargoes for Q4. The former will likely be bearish, at least in the medium term, while the latter could be more bullish, particularly given the expectation of large turnarounds at Asian smelters in Q4.\\nMeanwhile, Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.\\n∙Petrobras to decide on 60,000 mt tender July 3\\n∙European contracts unchanged for Q3\\n∙Offers from NW Europe reported as low as $25/mt FOB\\n∙Lacklustre Indian demand leads to lower price ideas\\n∙PASAR yet to restart\\n∙Japanese May exports jump 51.6%\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals were again down overall week on week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit continued to weigh heavily on markets. LME copper was at $5,755/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nUnsurprisingly there is little discussion of US acid or liquid sulphur pricing ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. Serious talks are more likely to start next week regarding liquid sulphur, with some knock-on result for acid values in the US Gulf.\\nFurther signs of slightly higher sulphur spot prices emerged this week, as Tasweeq posted its July QSP at $149/mt FOB, up $8/mt, and Adnoc posted its July OSP at $150/mt FOB, up $5/mt. Spot sales from the Middle East were reported as high as $150/mt FOB, though CFR levels in China and elsewhere were mostly stable on the week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week after being stable for six weeks following increases that began in mid-January. In recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices were fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras yet to decide on 60,000 mt tender\\nPetrobras has indicated that it will make a decision regarding its tender for 60,000 mt sulphuric acid this Friday, July 3, according to market sources.\\nSources were not certain how much, if any, of the volumes the buyer would commit to, but suggested it would be more likely to commit if the offered levels were below current spot prices in the $80s/mt CFR.\\nPetrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.\\nMosaic’s recent tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid, which closed on June 18 and was previously heard in the high $80s/mt CFR, was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer.\\nMarket participants are expecting further Brazilian enquiries in July, but nothing firm has emerged yet.\\nPort data showed that Yara received 18,000 mt at Rio Grande via Trammo from Antwerp on the Chemroad Hope May 17.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Q3 contracts settle at rollover\\nEuropean Q3 contracts for sulphuric acid have been settled unchanged from the previous quarter, several sources confirmed.\\nOne seller said that they achieved a single small increase, but all of their other contracts were a rollover.\\nMarket participants agreed with the assessed range of €57-80/mt CFR, though the upper end of the range will represent only a small minority of settlements.\\nSources saw the market as balanced to tight.\\nEurope: FOB spot steady but indications either side\\nEuropean spot prices for export were assessed unchanged based on recent business, though there were price ideas either side of the current $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe range.\\nThe most recent reported sale was Mosaic’s 12,000 mt tender, which closed June 18 and was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer. The price is in line with Brazilian sales of the past several month.\\nOne consumer reported offers as low as $25/mt FOB from Belgium. While some said this seemed too low, others said that long loading times might push freights for Belgian sales high enough to reduce netbacks to such a level.\\nAnother trader suggested that business up to $40/mt FOB NW Europe was possible, depending on the port, but others argued that spot prices on current European sales would not reach anywhere near this high.\\nFor now the market appears roughly balanced.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP out of acid spot market\\nMorocco remains absent from sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.\\nBuyer price ideas were in the low $40s/mt CFR, and spot offers to Morocco from European sellers have reportedly declined in recent weeks.\\nThe buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000-40,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is understood that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.\\nCRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nMorocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Price ideas lower as demand weakens\\nPrice ideas for Indian sulphuric acid have weakened as a result of the current reduction in spot demand, though market participants are awaiting firmer indications from the upcoming FACT tender.\\nOne trader suggested a current spot price for India of $10-16/mt FOB Japan.\\nBut others argued that even the recent purchase by PPL in the $50s/mt CFR does not net back to a level as low as $16/mt FOB.\\nSpot price ideas were generally pegged in the $50s/mt CFR, down from recent levels in the $60s/mt CFR or even higher.\\nThis suggests that the upper end of the current assessed range of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea may no longer be achievable for East Asian spot sellers and the assessment is likely to decline pending further information.\\nFACT’s tender for 14,000 mt for delivery at Kochi on or before August 31 closes on July 9.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan/South Korea: FOB prices stable, may inch down\\nEast Asian spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, but are likely to decline slightly over the coming weeks given improved availability and less prompt spot demand.\\nAlthough one source suggested prices to India at $16/mt FOB Japan, others said this would not be achievable, and recent Indian prices remain pegged in the $50s/mt CFR at the lowest.\\nSpot availability following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi\\'s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko\\'s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc\\'s Onahama smelter.\\nThen in Q2 Korea Zinc\\'s Onsan smelter shut for maintenance, as did the PASAR smelter in the Philippines.\\nA key driver of increased spot prices has been Indian prompt demand, but this appears to have diminished somewhat.\\nPASAR is still under maintenance and is likely to restart within the next two weeks. Much uncertainty centres on how much it is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. Although PASAR’s overall production for the year is not likely to be very different to its 2014 output when taking account the shutdown period, timing may mean that the market feels longer for a period in Q3.\\nLater in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters, which will remove large volumes from the market.\\nJapan: May exports jump 52%\\nJapan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.\\nThe Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 112,049 mt of the May tonnes.\\nChile was the next largest importer, taking 60,837 mt, followed by India with 46,624 mt.\\nIndonesia took 18,879 mt, Thailand took 12,020 mt, and Taiwan took 8,002 mt.

Yara Brazil and possibly Timac are likely to enter the market with spot demand soon, traders believe.\\nAs it stands, European FOB levels remained stable given the lack of increases in CFR levels to Brazil or Morocco.\\nEuropean talks for Q2 contracts have begun in earnest, but final settlements are likely a couple of weeks away. No major changes are expected, though some sellers believe that a small increase may be achievable.\\nHighlights of the week:\\nMosaic buys in mid-$80s/mt CFR Bunge Argentina buys in $90s/mt CFR\\nIndia pays close to $80/mt CFR for Chinese product Chinese imports continue declining\\nEuropean contract talks underway but no major change expected\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals were mixed over the week, as copper rebounded and zinc also showed some gains. A weaker US dollar combined with relatively low output has supported the copper price in recent days. LME copper was up to $6,134/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nSpeculation about a possible restart of MissPhos continue to swirl, due mostly to delays in any settlement in US bankruptcy court. That court will not rule until May about the disposition of the assets, in part because some investors and creditors in MissPhos are not convinced the plant should be liquidated. However, the need to replace the sulphuric acid unit on site (or run on purchased acid) continues to prompt industry players to predict that the complex will never produce phosacid again.\\nGlobal spot markets for sulphur were quiet with limited activity as buyers in most regions awaited further price declines. The upcoming April price announcements from Tasweeq and Adnoc should provide the market with more clarity.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices increased week on week to $1,650-1,700/mt CFR to $1,600-1,650/mt CFR China, continuing the rebound from the downward spiral the underwent from September 2014 to January of this year.\\nSULPHURIC ACID | 2\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nARGENTINA\\nBunge Argentina buys in $90s/mt\\nCFR\\nBunge Argentina’s most recent enquiry was reportedly met in the mid-$90s/mt CFR, though the price was not confirmed.\\nThe company\\'s requirement is the result of its SSP facilities in Ramallo.\\nIn October, the buyer reportedly bought a parcel of around 12,000 mt at a price of approximately $110/mt CFR.\\nArgentinian imports for 2014 totalled 64,482 mt based on one purchase of 14-17,000 mt per quarter.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nBRAZIL\\nMosaic buys in $80s/mt CFR\\nMosaic’s tender for 12,000 mt of sulphuric acid for shipment at the end of April was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR.\\nYara Brazil and possibly Timac are expected by traders to return to the market soon.\\nCHILE\\nChilean spot demand anticipated\\nSources continue to expect an increase in Chilean spot demand for Q2 following a lack of enquiries in the first quarter of the year.\\nCodelco’s Ministro Hales mine has still not reached full output because of issues with its roaster.\\nThe continued delays should maintain import demand to the country.\\nMEXICO\\nFertinal requirement covered by\\nChinese tonnes\\nSources suggested that Fertinal had bought 18-20,000 mt of product sourced from China in the mid-to-high $90s/mt CFR, but it is understood that the purchase was on contract rather than spot.\\nThe movement of Chinese product is believed to have been in order to cover contractual requirements that could not be met by other East Asian suppliers.\\nSULPHURIC ACID | 3\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nPERU\\nPeru\\'s January exports increase 10%\\nPeru’s exports of sulphuric acid for January increased 10.1% year on year to 108,421 mt, the highest monthly volume since September last year.\\nAll of the January volumes went to Chile, demonstrating that Peru is satisfying a large share of Chilean demand.\\nHowever, total exports from Peru this year are expected to be lower than in 2014 as supply remains roughly stable while domestic demand is expected to increase.\\nEUROPE\\nFull settlement on European contracts a couple of weeks away\\nEuropean Q2 contract talks are underway, though in some cases serious negotiations have yet to commence.\\nMost market participants expect prices to be a rollover, though some believe a slight increase may be achievable.\\nSources suggested that final settlements may not be reached until after the Easter holidays in early April.\\nEuropean FOB levels stable\\nEuropean spot prices remained assessed at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, though most in the market believed that prices at the lower end of this range would be difficult to achieve in the current market.\\nSome suggested that the high $30s/mt FOB would be more reflective of the current market. However, with Brazilian levels in the $80s/mt CFR and no Moroccan trades reported above the $50s/mt CFR, such levels did not seem representative of current business.\\nSome key producers are not active in the spot market because of a lack of availability, as contractual offtake remains high.\\nThe only turnarounds on the horizon currently in the region are Boliden’s Kokkola site at the end of May and Atlantic Copper’s Huelva site in September.\\nTURKEY\\nTurkish spot prices stable\\nLittle change was recorded in Turkish spot prices for sulphuric acid.\\nAlthough some maintained that spot prices would be at least $50/mt CFR, others said that they struggled to even obtain $45/mt CFR.\\nSULPHURIC ACID | 4\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMOROCCO\\nMorocco resists spot offers as requirement set to decrease\\nMoroccan demand for spot sulphuric acid has declined and is expected to decline further in April, according to an OCP company source.\\nAlthough traders said that the buyer would need to pay in the\\n$60s/mt CFR for spot product, it seemed unlikely that deals at such levels would take place, as it obtains contractual product at a lower price while sulphur prices are also decreasing.\\nOCP’s new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP\\'s other facilities.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nINDIA\\nIndian price ideas increasing\\nIndian prices were heard to be increasing as a result of persistent demand and tight availability.\\nSources reported a trade done close to $80/mt CFR for a cargo from China, indicating the need for spot product in India and the lack of spot availability from Japan and South Korea.\\nThe prompt need for product is reportedly driven by a delay in Paradeep Phosphates\\' sulphur burner.\\nPrevious bids in the $50s/mt CFR, which were no longer sufficient to attract any demand from Asian sellers, are no longer apparent.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nSulphuric Acid Arrivals: Jan 2015 – Mar 2015\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChinese sulphuric acid imports continue decline\\nChinese imports of sulphuric acid continued their decline, reaching 79,780 mt for February, 12% lower than February 2014.\\nAside from January’s 76,753 mt, it is the lowest monthly volume since August 2013.\\nSULPHURIC ACID | 5\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nAlmost all of the tonnes came from South Korea, although North Korea was the source of 815 mt and Taiwan the source of 561 mt.\\nChinese exporters receive demand\\nChinese exporters of sulphuric acid have benefited from a lack of spot availability from Japanese and South Korean sellers and prompt requirements for product to India and Mexico.\\nSellers are optimistic that over the next few weeks there may be further Indian demand for Chinese acid.\\nIn the domestic market, the pressure on suppliers has been increasing. In some regional markets such as Anhui province, the price of smelter acid dropped by RMB 20/mt.\\nSupply has therefore been depressed. Suppliers of acid have noted the bearish mood in the sulphur market, and are focused on ensuring the sales of planned quantities, meaning price is not their main concern.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7811 145370\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nCopyright notice:\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

High Chinese prices for prills, quoted well above $300/mt FOB for June would imply netbacks some $10/mt higher for Middle East producers, potentially reducing availability for the US and Brazil accordingly.\\nBullish sentiment on the spot market for prilled and granular urea did also prevail as participants in the 83rd annual IFA Conference gathered in Istanbul this week, but some more caution did emerge, even for the shorter term.\\nThe more bearish outlook for Black Sea urea was however dampened substantially via May 28 news that CherkassyAzot is one of the Group DF plants to close following the decision by DF to suspend production at all Ukrainian units. While the Cherkassy urea output has been limited to less than 50,000 mt/month lately, the decision will likely have a significant psychological impact on the short term regional urea market.\\nSurging values for granular urea in the US came to a halt as the IFA Conference was ending, with bargeloads changing hands up to $30/st off recent peaks. The driver at New Orleans is flooding in the Arkansas River markets that will make some June arrivals competitive while barge traffic waits to move north and west again. Furthermore, the timing of the delay means the inevitable end to the seasonal bull market for barges probably has moved to the start of June, rather than the end of the month. On the other hand, the sudden shortage in the largest urea consuming market in the US has added $5-20/st to truck prices in the Southern Plains this week.\\nEuropean distributors were meanwhile struggling to keep up with immediate demand, and spot trades in inland positions in Italy moved up sharply on pockets of demand that needed to be covered.\\nForward prices in Europe are nevertheless in line with numbers posted in recent weeks, and buyers maintain a relaxed attitude on availability and showed no intentions of stocking up at prevailing prices.\\nSimilar sentiment was also evident in Brazil where buyers continue to reject quotes based on prior sales by Middle East producers above $310/mt FOB. Indications of possible interest reflect returns some $10-15/mt\\nlower, but potential sales by Middle East producers in Pakistan might alter the approach by the Brazilian importers.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Group DF suspends urea output from Cherkassy Azot\\n∙US granular may be coming off their seasonal peak\\n∙Producers and traders prepare for TCP tenders in Pakistan\\n∙STC likely to float Indian urea tender early June\\n∙Netbacks in Egypt inch higher\\n∙Brazilian importers still reject high offers\\n∙Chinese suppliers maintain hard line on exports\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed. Many signs point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but uncertainty over the duration of the cutbacks in Chinese export volumes and the suspension of Group DF exports attract sufficient attention to conceivably support prices well into June.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Too wet for field work, prices unchanged\\nPrices were unchanged but relatively little field work has occurred this week due to wet weather over the prior couple of weeks. Quotes for granular urea remain at $370-375/st FOB Midwest from river terminals and inland warehouses. Demand may benefit in coming weeks as some farmers give more consideration to urea and UAN instead of ammonia due to ground conditions.\\nUS NOLA: Market turns midweek, floods block barges\\nAfter holding its ground around $355/st FOB New Orleans, granular urea barges lost almost $30/st late May 27 and May 28 as barge movement up the Arkansas River was substantially blocked by high water from flooding in Texas and Oklahoma.\\nBusiness was concluded around $355/st FOB early in the week. However, offers at $345/st FOB, $340/st FOB, $338/st FOB and $337/st FOB were reported and business was confirmed as low as $325/st FOB for prompt barges in the US Gulf. While floods are pulling back in the US interior, the delay moving up the\\nArkansas River means barges discharging in coming days can now compete for enduser business previously limited to barges already loaded in the Gulf.\\nUS S Plains: Flooding boosts warehouse values\\nDeadly flooding in Texas and Oklahoma is extending the halt to field work that wiped out most regional activity last week. At press time there was no word from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) over when or where the agency might close traffic on the Arkansas River due to high and fast moving water.\\nHowever, barge carriers were not adding tows to the river\\'s lineup. This in turn enabled warehouse sellers to boost demands for spot trucks to $370-390/st FOB throughout the region. Some distributors are scrambling to meet commitments tied to barges unable to move up the Arkansas River.\\nAt press time, local media in Oklahoma and Arkansas reported water was falling from levels up to 10 feet above flood stage at some river ports and terminals.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyers still reject high quotes for granular urea\\nBrazilian buyers are maintaining that prospects for a softer forward market for granular urea are such that purchases of forward positions as offered in the $330s/mt CFR are not viable. Indications of buying interest circulating in Istanbul were in the upper $310s/mt CFR, and buyers were in no rush to conclude.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: EuroChem books Salavat granular urea\\nEuroChem booked a total of 26,000 mt granular urea to load end June/early July in the May 27 Salavat tender originally floated for the sale of 20,000 mt to load early July. The exact price in the transaction was not released, but local reports suggest that the deal was struck around $315/mt FOB.\\nPrills are on offer at $288-293/mt FOB depending on quantity, loadport and time of loading, but buying interest remains subdued. Traders are thus far unwilling to assume forward length and netbacks on open business in Latin America are below the $285/mt FOB marker.\\nBlack Sea: Prices stable week on week\\nThe IFA conference in Istanbul did not serve as a platform for further substantial increases in Black Sea prices for prills, but news of Group DF suspension of output from its Ukrainian plants could trigger additional price increases. The suspension includes urea from Cherkassy Azot.\\nLimited trades in Turkey were indicative of netbacks around the $285/mt FOB marker. Quotes from producers are no lower than $292-294/mt FOB, but widespread reports of sales by OPZ at $290-291/mt FOB\\nfor June loading could not be confirmed. The suggested deals have therefore not be included in the range posted for the week.\\nWhile the duration of the closure of urea output from Cherkassy remains uncertain, the loss of close\\nto 50,000 mt urea per month from the Black Sea will be significant for nearby markets such as Turkey and Italy where NF Trading has been feeding its distribution network.\\nShipments in May from Yuzhnyy/TIS appear set to pan out a little short of 150,000 mt, including about 30,000 mt for Egypt and 30,000 mt for Mexico, destinations that have not been featuring notably from Yuzhnyy since quite some time.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: OCI suggested as buyer of MOPCO parcel\\nOCI is now suggested as the buyer of the 3,000 mt granular urea sold by MOPCO pursuant to the May 21 tender at $320/mt FOB for prompt lifting.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: STC in line for new tender in June\\nIndian importer STC is expected to float a new tender for urea to complement the relatively limited 775,000 mt procured by IPL via the May 9 session. The new tender for an unspecified quantity of urea is expected out in the first week of June, and will likely permit shipment through Agust 15-20.\\nThe Department of Fertilizers will be keenly watching offers in the TCP tenders in Pakistan closing May 29 and June 1 for guidance on pricing in the region.\\nSri Lanka: MoA to tender for urea June 9\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is to tender on June 9 for 36,000 mt granular urea plus 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea.\\nThe full quantity is to be available for distribution in bags in Colombo in August, implying shipment by the end of July/early August if loaded from China and the Middle East. The tender will provide an indication of traders\\' and producers\\' perceptions of the forward market for both urea grades.\\nPakistan: ECC clears additional imports\\nPakistan\\'s Economic Co-ordination Committee (ECC) has finally cleared the import of a further 150,000t of urea for Kharif application. The ECC clearance has been pending since the Fertilizer Review Committee recommended the additional imports in early April.\\nThe tenders will follow the two sessions by Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) set to close May 29 and June 1 for 50,000 mt each. The 150,000 mt requirement is expected to be split into three separate TCP tenders for 50,000 mt each, likely to close late June, allowing for shipment by July 20-25.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Dongbu, Namhae testing regional prices\\nDongbu is reported to have taken an additional 4-5,000 mt granular urea from China marginally below $325/mt CFR, suggesting a netback to the seller around $305/mt FOB from China.\\nAmeropa was widely associated with the deal. Namhae was in discussions with suppliers in Istanbul for a parcel of about 6,000 mt granular urea for late June delivery, but a deal had yet to be confirmed at press time.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim V production improving\\nWhile production of ammonia at the facility is up to about 75% of rated capacity, output of granular urea from Kaltim V is currently running at about 45% of the unit\\'s rated 3,500 mt/day capacity due to technical issues. The producer has not indicated a date for completion of the repairs currently being made to the plant.\\nThailand: Buyers yet to concede higher granular prices\\nImporters in Thailand are yet to give in to demands from sellers for prices above $330/mt CFR and cite renewed approaches from traders offering Iranian granular urea.\\nWhile up on last week\\'s $305/mt CFR deal, offers at $310-312/mt CFR for Iranian material are suggested in support of calls for lower offers from traditional sources. Contract cargoes priced via formulae are suggested arriving around an even $320/mt CFR, but suppliers are pushing hard for better returns.\\nChina: Urea values up, domestic may be near peak\\nDomestic values for prilled and granular urea in China firmed further this week as local distributors continued purchasing in preparation for the peak application season for corn. Prills for prompt export were again sold close to $300/mt FOB to traders short for India at netbacks some $12-14/mt lower, with offers for June closer to $305/mt FOB.\\nOffers for granular urea for export are maintained well above $310/mt for regular Chinese quality, and above $320/mt FOB for premium product.\\nOffers at high prices did however slow activity somewhat as acceptance of the higher numbers at retail level is yet to be fully tested. Estimates on availability versus demand differ substantially, and a more cautious approach has been noted.\\nMainstream domestic trades in prills at RMB 1,680-1,700/mt ($271-274/mt) EXW in northern China were up by RMB 30-50/mt ($5-8/mt) on last week. Similar increases were also recorded in Shanxi where product traded at RMB 1,620-1,650/mt ($261-266/mt) FCA.\\nDomestic buyers are competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,730/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $304/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.\\nDomestic values for granular urea for export were up to RMB 1,780/mt CPT northern ports, indicative of an export price at $312/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. Offers circulating May 28 were above RMB 1,800/mt CPT.\\nInventories in ports for export are down on last week. Yantai inventory is assessed at 220,000 mt this week compared to 300,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 130,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have slowed to about 10,000 mt/day.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim fails to achieve target-price\\nThe May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim to load by June 15 that had been restricted to a limited number of participants attracted one bid only, at $305/mt FOB Bontang.\\nThe producer had been targeting netbacks in excess of the $311-311.50/mt FOB concluded with Fertcomm and Ameropa for 30,000 mt each in prior sessions, and is currently in discussions with traders, attempting to secure an improvement in pricing for the cargo still available. A further cargo of around 30,000 mt is also being discussed for later loading.\\nChina: April urea exports close to 850,000 mt\\nApril exports of urea from China were limited to about 850,000 mt, down sharply on the 1.31 million mt exported in April 2014.\\nThe drop in volume reflects the firmer stance against low prices adopted by the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association that triggered rejections of bids from traders at levels below returns available in the domestic market.\\nThe April volume did nevertheless lift January-April exports to about 5.28 million mt, still some\\n61% ahead of the 3.27 million mt exported in the first four months of 2014. May 2015 exports are also predicted relatively low, likely in line with the 545,000 mt exported in May 2014.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Sales are reported above the $300/mt FOB marker for prills to cover traders short on sales in India via the IPL tender and to Pakistan in the recent TCP sessions. Prilled values are now rapidly approaching those for granular urea.\\nUnlike prills, traders were generally cautious to short Chinese product in recent weeks, and attempts by sellers to secure traditional premiums for regular Chinese granular have not been successful. Superior Chinese product such as the China Blue granular does however still trade at premiums above $10/mt on prills.\\nA softer sentiment is definitely apparent for granular urea in the region, evidenced not only by limited buying interest in China, but also via low bids for the 60,000 mt premium quality product from Kaltim in Indonesia this week.\\nA shift in concentration from prilled to granular urea will obviously occur if regional values of the two grades should closely match, as enduser markets favour Chinese granular over Chinese prills.\\nThe overall market for granular urea nevertheless depends increasingly on sustained values in the US barge market, but these were also southbound for forward positions this week.\\nFinding the trend for granular urea barges in the US has been problematc all year, as traders continually sold forward tons substantially lower than the prompt market. This pattern was repeated this week, as spot granular urea barges changed hands in the $330s-$340s/st FOB New Orleans while 1H July barges sold around $305/st FOB. This pattern has made the US less attractive than other markets for granular urea, which ultimately has led to thin supplies on a prompt basis for the last couple of months.\\nIn Europe, buyers remain cautious and the majority of importers of granular product are yet to get on the band-wagon for significant quantities for August and beyond. Some buyers have nevertheless opted to hedge the forward market by purchasing parts of envisaged requirements close to current values. These decisions were undoubtedly influence by erratic output in North Africa in recent weeks.\\nBrazilian importers that were off for a holiday June 4 continued to play a waiting-game this week, evidently feeling convinced that a buyer\\'s market will return in July. Procurement anywhere close to the offers in the high $330s/mt CFR currently on the table is not regarded an advisable move by the importers, despite repeat reports of Middle East cargos originally intended for Brazil being diverted to the US and Australia.\\nPrilled values were not only gaining in China. Limited availability out of the Black Sea following Group DF\\'s decision to suspend urea output from Cherkassy triggered a 25,000 mt purchase by NF Trading to load in June to cover quantity-commitments via NF Italia, mainly to industrial clients. The $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy price suggested in the deal did raise some eyebrows in the trade, as offers for smaller quantities from Yuzhnyy were available to load in June some $5/mt lower.\\nOn the demand side, planting in the US slowed this week, with corn approaching completion. The US set 2015 blending volumes at 13.4 billion gallons, below market expectations and well below the 15\\nbillion gallons that were legislated.\\nThe Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to BRL 187.7 billion ($59.8 billion), termed a \\'generous surprise\\' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.\\nFarmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates in production loans to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to BRL 94.5 billion ($30.12 billion). For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75% per annum (p.a.), while larger producers who take a bulk of the funding will see rates of 8.75% p.a. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5% p.a. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates that are around 17-23% p.a.\\nWhile the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to fertilizer purchases. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit.\\nThe Indian Meteorological Department continues to be downbeat on its monsoon forecast, this week lowering likely rainfall levels to 88% of normal (93% last week). Indications are for 66% chance of a \\'deficient\\' monsoon and only a 6% chance of a \\'normal\\' season.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Offers to TCP in Pakistan plentiful, but at high prices compared to India`\\n∙Kaltim fails to achieve targets in June 3 sales tender for 60,000 mt granular\\n∙US granular settles into more modest price-range\\n∙Chinese prilled values surge close to granular on trader shorts\\n∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent\\n∙Pakistan\\'s ECC clears more imports, but tenders yet to be floated\\n∙Brazilian importers reject high offers as news on increased credits emerge\\n∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed. Market perception remains for significant oversupply in Q3 and into Q4, but cuts in output and pockets of regional shortages could well support current values into July. Forward length point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but the timing of the corrections is still open for debate.\\nContinued price-strength beyond July 15 does however appear questionable and traders are already evaluating timing for possible short positions. Once and when over the \"edge\", urea values will undoubtedly suffer from lack of market liquidity, suggesting that downward corrections may be quite substantial.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: Conditions still drying out\\nRetailers are adding to their urea positions but relatively little product has moved to the ground this week, mostly due to the soggy conditions. Once corn acres are more supportive for application equipment, a surge in demand is expected that distributors will find difficult to meet.\\nNew tows have not been able to start up the flooded Arkansas River for a week and another week of at least slow movement is anticipated. As a result, truck values generally remain around $390/st FOB in Oklahoma and Arkansas.\\nUS: April plunge in arrivals aided recent price strength\\nEven though the plunge in US urea imports during April was expected, much of the marketplace did not forecast quite such a decline as was reported this week by the US Department of Commerce. April arrivals fell to 695,753 st (631,183 mt) from 1.06 million st (963,427 mt) one year earlier. Apparent denial on the part of many traders about the April volumes likely fueled the strong prices seen in May\\'s barge market.\\nMost of the decline in arrivals was spread relatively evenly across traditional suppliers to the US. Somewhat surprisingly the decline in shipments from Caribbean suppliers Venezuela and Trinidad was the most stark, with just 4,439 st arriving in April 2015 versus 151,704 st in April 2014. The largest suppliers to the US duiring April of this yea included Qatar at 170,685 st, UAE at 145,916 st and Canada at 127,139 st.\\nFor the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, US urea imports were 7.23 million st (6.56 million mt) versus 6.61 million st (6 million mt) for the prior year period. Key subscribers for July-April of this year included Qatar at 1.42 million st, China at 1.37 million st and Canada at 798,691 st. While the year- over-year totals still show a significant surge in US imports this year, the April shortfall and long-held anecdotal views that the US needed to make up for a severely depleted supply chain at the start of the fertilizer year suggest that US supplies are relatively snug given typical spring demand.\\nCanada: Urea imports and exports on the rise\\nCanadian exports of urea in April were up by 88.5% and January-April exports were lifted by 14.7%. January-April imports were up by 36%.\\nApril exports of 142,000 mt were destined almost exclusively to the US, as was the January-April volume of 401,000 mt.\\nApril imports of 104,000 mt were up by 10.2% on April 2014. The US accounted for 42,000 mt, down by 8.7%, while deliveries from Russia of 28,500 mt were up by 59%.\\nJanuary-April imports of 281,000 mt were up by 36% on 2014, but arrivals from the US of 98,000 mt were off by 6.9%. Germany accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 53% while arrivals of 32,000 mt from Bahrain lifted imports from that nation from zero in the prior year. Russia accounted for 31,000 mt, Qatar for 21,000 mt, UAE for 19,000 mt and Kuwait for 17,000 mt.\\nUS NOLA: Trades and prices pick up\\nThe high end of the granular urea barge market started the week and generally held at $345-348/st FOB, but prompt barges also traded as low as $335/st FOB. Offers for 2H June barges were as high as $340/st FOB, but most trades occured at $316-320/st FOB. Forward business for 1H July is substantially discounted at $305/st FOB.\\nMeanwhile, full tows will not be able to move up the Arkansas River to Tulsa Oklahoma for as long as two weeks while flood waters ease.\\nThere are reports that EuroChem\\'s June cargo that was due in the Gulf June 11 now will not reach the Southwest Pass to the Mississippi River until June 16. A Koch cargo out of Oman previously expected in the first half of this month now appears likely to discharge at the end of the month. Finally, traders report CF Industries temporarily stopped making new truck sales out of Donaldsonville Louisiana plant this week in order to catch up on its barge commitments, but the company has not posted any news relating to the rumor.\\nMexico: Interest in prilled and granular urea\\nMexican importers indicate interest in additional volumes of granular urea for the West Coast (WCM) and there is also open interest in prills for the East Coast (ECM).\\nIndications from buyers for WCM granular are around $325/mt CFR, but importers appear in no hurry to cover, citing prospects of further price-concessions in coming weeks. Offers are well above $330/mt CFR despite the slight weakening in recent netbacks to Chinese producers.\\nImporters of prills for ECM are yet to concede demands from sellers of prills from the FSU based on FOB values from the Baltic and the Black Sea in the upper $290s/mt FOB and are aiming some $15/mt below indications around the $320/mt CFR marker.\\nMexican imports of urea in March were up by a full 125% to 120,000 mt. Chinese product accounted for 58,000 mt, up from zero in March 2014. Deliveries from Russia of 49,000 mt were up by 5% to 49,000 mt.\\nQ1 imports of 215,500 mt were nevertheless only up by 8% on the prior year, but imports from China registered an increase of 254% to reach 119,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia were down by 34.4% to 82,000 mt and shipments from Qatar were down to zero from 33,000 mt in Q1 2014.\\nUS Midwest/N Plains: Retailers travel farther for urea\\nGranular urea is in tight supply from the Dakotas to Illinois, although pricing has only moved modestly higher in recent days. Buyers in the Dakotas have been willing to shop for truckloads from Missouri and Iowa rather than risk delays possible when ordering by rail. As a result business in the last few days in the Dakotas has occured up to $400/st DEL this week, up $5/st from last week\\'s high. On the other hand warehouse pricing in Iowa and Minnesota continues at $370-375/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nPeru: Urea imports through Q1 up significantly\\nPeruvian imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS in the first quarter of 2015 of 119,000 mt were up by 86.6% following a massive increase of 262% to 63,600 mt in the month of March. Deliveries in March from China of 43,400 mt were up from zero in March 2014 while Russian arrivals of 20,200 mt were up by 15%.\\nChina also dominated Q1 imports with deliveries of 70,200 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. Arrivals from Russia were however down by 26% in the quarter, to 48,200 mt.\\nColombia: Imports of urea down significantly in Q1\\nImports of urea by Colombia as identified by customs via GTIS in March were down by 22.6% on March 2014 to 24,400 mt. This brought the Q1 total to 71,000 mt, down by 35.4% on the prior year.\\nThe imports in March and in the first quarter of the year were about equally split between supplies from China and Venezuela.\\nRenewed interest in imports of granular urea emerged this week for a cargo in combination with a requirement in El Salvador. Indications from sellers for Chinese product in the upper $330s/mt CFR for two ports on the west coast did not elicit significant buying interest.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nUkraine: Urea exports continue to trail prior years\\nExports of urea from Ukraine continue to suffer from cutbacks in output from Group DF units and the overall instability in the country. March exports identified by customs via GTIS of 168,600 mt were down by 16% on March 2014, and Q1 exports of 436,000 mt were down by 13.9%.\\nMarch shipments of 85,000 mt to Turkey were down by 24%, but the 25,000 mt loaded for Spain was up from zero in March 2014. Shipments to Italy of 17,600 mt were off by 51%.\\nTurkey accounted fror 209,000 mt out of the Q1 volume, up by 9.5% on Q1 2014. Shipments to Spain were up from 6,600 mt to 59,000 mt while deliveries to Italy were down by 25.3% to 58,000 mt.\\nBlack Sea: Prilled price up on NF purchase\\nTrading in prilled urea remains limited out of the Black Sea, mainly on limited availability following the closure of the Group DF plants, as reported last week. The cut in Cherkassy output triggered a purchase by NF Trading this week from a trader at a suggested $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy for 25,000 mt to load for Italy mid- June to cover prior commitments via NF Italia originally planned to load from own production.\\nThe price indicated is viewed with some scepticism in the trade, given offers in the beginning of the week some $4-5/mt lower.\\nShipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS in May worked out marginally above 146,000 mt and the lineup for June is so far limited to about 14,000 mt loading on the Abdullatif (11,000 mt for Keytrade) and the C. Pioneer (3,300 mt for Wittraco).\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Some more forward interest for July, August\\nSuppliers of granular urea to France for forward positions suggest that trades for July and August delivery have been concluded in the low €320s/mt FCA this week. Buyers still contend that cover for August can be obtained below €300/mt FCA.\\nThe prompt market is void of activity, and is therefore assessed at par with last week around the €325/mt FCA marker. This implies a delivered value around $350/mt CFR into the French Bay given the stronger euro in recent days, suggesting netbacks to Egyptian producers below $315/mt FOB for an intermediary to generate a margin. Sales of July posititions would provide producers with returns around $310/mt FOB if loaded from Egypt.\\nTurkey: Q1 2015 imports below 2014\\nTurkish importers of urea for direct application are largely holding off on purchases due to the higher values perceived for Black Sea material following the closure of Group DF output of urea. Open interest is essentially limited to industrial users such as Kastamonu that tenders June 4 for 3,500 mt for June delivery.\\nTurkish imports of urea in Q1 2015 as identified by customs via GTIS of 356,000 mt were meanwile off by 5.5% on the first quarter of 2014. This despite March imports of 152,000 mt that were up by 9% on the prior year.\\nMarch imports from Ukraine of 81,000 mt were up by 23% on March 2014 and deliveries from Iran of 40,500 mt were up by 266%. Arrivals from Russia were down by 66% to 15,000 mt and China accounted for 12,000 mt.\\nQ1 arrivals from Ukraine of 175,000 mt were up by 19% and deliveries from Iran of 105,000 mt were up by a full 471%. China accounted for 34,300 mt, up from 1,600 in Q1 in 2014. Shipments of 15,000 mt from Russia were down by 89.6% and arrivals from Romania of 9,500 mt were down by 68% compared to Q1 2014.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Offers available despite cuts\\nTraders suggest that indications of availability of granular urea around the $320/mt FOB marker are available from Egyptian producers despite continuing cuts in output due to erratic supply of natural gas.\\nLimited prompt trades in granular urea are reported in key European outlets, but indications of interest in forward positions in France and Mediterranean markets would provide sellers with returns around $310- 315/mt FOB for cargoes loading in June when allowing for storage plus financing costs.\\nAlgeria: Sorfert to restore urea output shortly\\nAlgerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nThe producer completed loading of 15 vessels in May for contract-holders Helm, Indagro, Keytrade, OCI, Trammo and Ameropa for a total close to 100,000 mt despite the outage and the force majeure declaration that ensued. Indagro was in the freight market this week for a vessel to load 25,000 mt for the US Gulf in June 6-8 laydays from Arzew.\\nOperations at the first 1.3 million mt/year AOA granular urea line are reported regular with additional nominations made for carriers to load for Europe and Brazil.\\nMiddle East: Producers still bullish on limited supply\\nMiddle East producers cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments around $315/mt FOB despite lower bids from traders.\\nReturns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are yet to exceed $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers appear in no hurry to secure additional tonnage given inbound carriers with unsold quantities on board.\\nDespite the rebound in US spot prices this week, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in about two weeks around an even $320/st FOB are indicative of delivered values of $346/mt CFR, suggesting producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $320/mt FOB. End-June/early July trades around $305/st FOB New Orleans reflect returns at $305/mt FOB Middle East.\\nFirm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East were posted June 4 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $295/mt FOB against bids at $285/mt FOB.\\nEgypt: Natural gas shortages reflected in exports\\nShortages of natural gas continue to impact urea exports from Egypt identitified by customs via GTIS, with the Q1 2015 volume down by a full 80% on 2014 to 154,000 mt. March exports of 37,500 mt were down by\\n84% with deliveries to France cut by 80% to 34,000 mt. Shipments to Greece of 2,600 mt were down by 88%.\\nQ1 shipments to France of 93,500 were off by 79.2% while cargoes loaded from Italy totaling 19,500 mt were down by 86%, and shipments to Greece dropped by 62.3% to 19,000 mt. Deliveries to Spain were down from 64,000 mt to 2,000 mt.\\nSouth Africa: Urea imports through April down on 2014\\nSouth African imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from January through April of 99,300 mt were down by 36.1% on the same period in 2014.\\nQatar accounted for 61,600 mt, down by 13.7% on the prior year while deliveries from Saudi Arabia of 28,000 mt were off by 58%. Shipments from the UAE of 7,200 mt were up from zero in the same period in 2014.\\nApril imports of 25,000 mt were mainly sourced from Qatar, and were down by 49.3% on on April 2014.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: GTIS identifies March imports at 729,000 mt\\nIndian imports of urea in March as identified by customs via GTIS of 729,000 mt were up by 248% on March 2014. This lifted Q1 imports to 2.34 million mt, up by 144% on Q1 2014.\\nMarch imports from China of 438,000 mt were up sharply on the 38,000 mt imported in March 2014 and imports from OMIFCO in Oman of 314,000 mt were up by 33% on the prior year. Imports from Iran in March 2015 of 75,000 mt were up from zero in March 2014.\\nChina accounted for 1.72 million mt of the 2.34 million imported in Q1, up by 335% on the prior year. Deliveries from Oman were up by 5.25% to 522,000 mt and shipments from Iran totaled 75,000 mt. Provisional data from the Fertilizer Association of India for April imports as posted in the May 20 update suggested a 872,000 mt volume.\\nA May 27 statement issued by the Indian Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers contended that supply of urea for Kharif is \"adequate and comfortable\", citing an increase in imports of 1 million mt and a similar increase in domestic output. A follow-up tender to secure cover to complement the relatively limited tonnage prodcured via the April 10 STC tender and the May 9 IPL session is nevertheless expected early June to make up for the estimated shortfall in availability for Kharif.\\nPakistan: TCP awards Dreymoor and Samsung\\nPakistani importer TCP has issued Letters of Intent to Dreymoor and Samsung at the prices offered by the traders in the May 29 and June 1 tenders, respectively.\\nDreymoor was awarded the 50,000 mt in the May 29 session at $318.63/mt CFR while Samsung took the 50,000 mt in the June 1 tender at $318.53/mt CFR.\\nTCP has yet to receive final instructions to proceed with tenders to cover the 150,000 mt urea approved by the ECC for import pursuant to the awards made in the above tenders, but is expected to float three sessions for 50,000 mt each at the end of June/early July.\\nPakistan: June 1 TCP tender attracts 13 offers\\nThe June 1 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from 13 suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.\\nSamsung reduced its $319.92/mt CFR price in the May 29 session to $318.53/mt CFR and was the lowest in the June 1 tender. Dreymoor was second June 1 at $318.54/mt CFR, followed by Liven at $325.38/mt CFR and by Ameropa at $327.43/mt CFR. Transglobe was at $329.21/mt CFR, Swiss at $329.43/mt CFR, Indagro at $329.74/mt CFR, and Quantum at $329.75/mt CFR. Keytrade, Daewoo, Fertisul, CHS and Trammo were all above $330/mt CFR.\\nThe Samsung offer was down by a mere $0.10/mt on the winning Dreymoor offer in the May 29 tender.\\nPakistan: May 29 TCP tender attracts eight offers\\nThe May 29 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from eight suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.\\nDreymoor submitted the lowest offer at $318.63/mt CFR, followed by Samsung at $319.92/mt CFR and by Keytrade at $332.50/mt CFR. Ameropa was at $332.76/mt CFR, Quantum at $332.90/mt CFR, Liven at $334.38/mt CFR, Transglobe at $334.50/mt CFR and CHS at $338.37/mt CFR.\\nThe Dreymoor offer reflected a netback to the trader marginally below $300/mt FOB from China basis freight for a large carrier on TCP terms estimated at $15-17/mt and transaction costs including L/C confirmation charges around $3/mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nMalaysia: Mixed signals in exports through February\\nMalaysian February urea exports identified by customs via GTIS of 100,000 mt were off by about 12% on February 2014, but the January- February volume of 187,000 mt was up by 9% on the first two months of 2014.\\nFebruary exports to the Philippines were up by 114% to 39,500 mt while deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by about 50% on the prior year.\\nThe Philippines accounted for 92,000 mt of the 187,000 mt shipped in January-February, up by 196%, while\\nAustralia went from zero to 33,000 mtin the two months. Shipments to the US\\nwere off by 50% per the above while deliveries to Thailand of 15,000 mt were down by 68% on the prior year.\\nThailand: Urea imports up in April, Saudis supply bulk\\nTrade in granular urea in Thailand remains subdued due to the wide spread in price ideas tabled by sellers and buyers. Quotes in the mid- $330s/mt CFR are countered around an even $320/mt CFR, at best, and importers appear content to wait for price-concessions from suppliers.\\nA trader is in the freight market for a vessel to load 25,000 mt granular urea from Tianjin or Jinzhou in China to Bangkok/Kohsichang in June 10-20 laydays.\\nImports of urea by Thailand in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 207,400 mt were meanwhile up by 3.2% on April 2015. Saudi Arabia accounted for 103,000 mt, Qatar for 44,000 mt, Malaysia 31,000 mt and Oman for 22,000 mt.\\nJanuary-April imports of 551,000 mt were nevertheless off by about 14.6% on the first four months of 2014. Saudi Arabia remained the number one supplier with 251,000 mt, but that volume was down by 14.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Malaysia were up marginally to 97,000 mt while deliveries from Qatar of 89,000 mt were off by 19.6%. Shipments from Indonesia of 30,000 mt were up by 20% on the prior year.\\nChina: Offers for prilled urea up further for export\\nDomestic values for prilled and granular urea in China were largely in line with last week, but quotes for prills for export were up. Offers for prills for prompt export are at $305-308/mt FOB while quotes for regular Chinese quality granular were maintained marginally above the $310/mt FOB marker.\\nMainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) EXW in northern China were at par with last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,620/mt ($261/mt) FCA.\\nDomestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.\\nDomestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,780-1,800/mt CPT northern ports, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. A 7,000 mt sale to Namhae in South Korea this week is however reported at a netback to the seller assessed around\\n$308/mt FOB. China Blue meanwhile indicated returns marginally above $315/mt FOB for its premium quality product.\\nThe softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident in the June 3 tender in Indonesia that attracted bids no higher than $302/mt FOB Bontang against the reserve set by Pupuk Kaltim at $325/mt FOB for the premium-quality grade. Kaltim has since adjusted its reserve to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders.\\nInventories in Chinese ports for export have increased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is assessed at 270,000 mt this week compared to 220,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 180,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have however slowed to about 5,000 mt/day from about 10,000 mt/day last week. Qingdao inventory is assessed at a mere 25,000 mt.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim scraps sales tender\\nPupuk Kaltim elected to scrap the June 3 tender for the sale of 60,000 mt granular urea for June lifting from Bontang. The producer had set the reserve (minimum) price for the tonnage at $325/mt FOB, but failed to attract bids close to that number.\\nThe highest bid received was from CHS at $302/mt FOB, with FertComm second at $300/mt FOB. These were down on the single bid at $305/mt FOB received by Kaltim in the May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt that was also scrapped.\\nThe producer has since adjusted its reserve down to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders. Production of ammonia at Kaltim V is meanwhile close to rated capacity and urea is running around 80% of capacity.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Maybe it will happen in July, presumably before the industry gathers at the annual Southwestern Fertilizer Conference.\\nThis week flooding that has prevented barge travel along the Arkansas River for two weeks, and likely for another week to 10 days forced distributors to truck granular urea hundreds of miles the Mississippi River to Arkansas, Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The alternative was to pay more for the few spot barges remaining at the mouth of the Arkansas River, and pay they did. While barges in the Gulf or along the upper Mississippi River sold at $341-355/st FOB, barges positioned closer to the Arkansas River or able to discharge to trucks heading west sold as high as $370/st FOB.\\nThe constant expectation of a correction in US prices in prior weeks and months prevented many cargos from being added to the US lineup that might have eased the tight market by now. While the end of seasonal US demand should relax US support for global pricing, there can be little doubt the US system will be substantially drained. Outside of programmed Middle East granular, most of the late July spot granular arrivals will total about 70,000 mt of Chinese granular split between a full cargo owned by China Oil and a part cargo for Trammo. However, if CF\\'s urea expansion starts up as planned in August then the need for substantially more replacement tons from overseas should be eased in the near term.\\nTrades in barge positions for first half July around $315/st FOB have been used to assess current Middle East netbacks for the US trade as tonnage off vessels yet to load would only be available in July. The resulting netback to regional producers is still ahead of returns in spot markets such as Brazil.\\nOpinions on the global market for granular urea differ widely, and the cliff from which prices were expected to fall as indicated in the June 4 issue of Fertilizer Week appears to be more of a moving target than originally anticipated. Multiple sellers point to this week\\'s deals for granular urea from Kaltim as a regional floor in values through the first half of July, while several buyers refer to the concessions made by Kaltim as evidence of forward weakness.\\nMiddle East producers also conceded minor discounts in sales of tonnage outside contract commitments this week, with one Omani cargo reportedly booked at an even $310/mt FOB. Offers for additional tonnage are however limited and are priced above the $310/mt FOB marker. The presence of Iranian availability was felt again in Turkey this week where sales concluded reflected Middle East netbacks well below $295/mt FOB and returns to North African producers below $310/mt FOB.\\nThe pockets of opportunity to sell granular product at the higher values perceived by market bulls are nevertheless diminishing as peak demand will soon subside in the US and in Europe. Global importers that are attempting to evaluate the risk in delaying forward procurement versus prospects for sustained values beyond mid-July are faced with no easy task, but playing the waiting game could well be the best strategy for requirements beyond July.\\nBrazilian buyers cite limited inland offtake and poor forward prospects in support of decisions to remain sidelined and procurement has largely stalled.\\nOn the reverse side of the market-coin, Chinese suppliers of prills are maintaining a firm stance on prices and have booked substantial volumes with traders short for India and Pakistan above $300/mt FOB. Demand is perceived substantial for the coming 30-60 days as India will need to return to the markert shortly and three Pakistani tenders are set to be floated in June. Limited unsold volumes in Chinese ports sugest that availability into July will be relatively tight, but prospects are for substantial additional volumes after the Chinese corn application ends.\\nNetbacks in prills from the FSU did move slightly lower this week as traders needing to cover prompt positions had completed most purchases in the rush of activity that took place from the Black Sea last week, but limited output from Ukraine suggests that major downward corrections are unlikely in the short term, despite the re-emergence of Iranian granular in Mediterranean markets.\\nIn Australia, ABARES provided production forecasts. Citing lower plantings and the potential for El Nino to lower yields on the east coast, wheat output was cut to 23.6 million mt. Conditions in major fertilizer consumption areas have been dryer than normal over the past month, which has allowed for good planting progress. Rain over the coming weeks will be needed to boost urea and UAN applications.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙US granular gained in prompt, 1H July markets\\n∙Kaltim adjusts prices and concludes major volume\\n∙Chinese prilled values almost at par with granular\\n∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent\\n∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but also suggested imminent\\n∙Sorfert in Algeria back up, but AOA output may have been suspended\\n∙EFC cargo from Egypt to head for the US\\n∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line\\n∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed. Market perception is split almost evenly between bulls and bears, but a general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is in place. The timing and the extent of such corrections do however remain open for substantial debate.\\nA significant drop in US values is nevertheless expected for barges trading for delivery for the second half of July. These corrections are set to influence global values substantially, but are already largely accounted for in Middle East spot values.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest/Great Lakes: Demand keeps prices steady\\nGranular urea sales remain steady across the Midwest and in the Great Lakes states. A steady supply of replacement urea primarily by barge is helping to keep prices stable around $375/st FOB from river terminals, but as high as $395/st FOB in Michigan and Wisconsin. Urea is in greater demand than last year for top-dress on corn, according to anecdotal reports from distributors.\\nMexico: Group books prills and SAN with Uralchem\\nThe Mexican Group of importers is evaluating offers received June 10 against its June 10 request for cover for up to 25,000 mt prilled urea in combination with 5,000 mt stabilized AN.\\nDetails of offers submitted were not released, but suggestions are that an award is being processed to Uralchem for the combination. The urea will likely have been priced marginally below $310/mt CFR for east coast Mexico discharge. This is based on an assessed $288/mt FOB value plus freight around $20/mt from the Baltic.\\nThe prior sales of granular urea to Tepeyac and Isaosa for the west coast now appear possible to be shipped from Indonesia, given this week\\'s purchases by CHS and Samsung from Kaltim of 2x30,000 mt for June loading.\\nUS S Plains: Truck values flat despite spot outages\\nSo far this week quotes for granular urea from Arkansas River terminals generally are not cited above\\n$390/st FOB. The flat pricing at this level over the last few weeks has held even though replacement costs out of the barge market are in the $350s/st FOB New Orleans. The lack of barge travel due to high water along the Arkansas River also is adding to distributors\\' costs for now.\\nBuyers have been forced to truck urea and other products from terminals along the lower Mississippi River and from New Orelans to Oklahoma and elsewhere. Distributors reported June 10 that Koch was limiting sales from its Enid Oklahoma plant due to heavy demand.\\nUS NOLA: Prompt barges getting much stronger\\nPrompt granular urea barges sold as low as $341/st FOB New Orleans this week, but most of the activity was for barges at Rosedale and for the few still available along the Arkansas River. Most trades occured at $350-360/st FOB, but at the end of the week bidding wars erupted for well-placed barges. Those few barges sold as high as $370/st FOB June 11.\\nPrilled urea, most of which is believed to be of Russian origin, has sold at $310-313/st FOB New Orleans this week.\\nAccess for new tows to move up the Arkansas River may take more than a week to be restored. Travel as far as the central and western Oklahoma likely will not be restored before July 1, according to transportation sources. Barge carriers had to stop moving new tows on to the Arkansas River when heavy rain in Oklahoma and Arkansas led to flooding.\\nThe alternative for Arkansas River distributors that need prompt granular urea has been to buy truckloads from lower Mississippi River terminals and even from New Orleans for the long journey to Arkansas, Oklahoma and soutnern Kansas.\\nUS N Plains: Wider price spread emerges in Dakotas\\nGranular urea is available as low as $380/st DEL in the Dakotas this week, although some distributors still are posting nearer to $400/st DEL. Product is arriving mostly from the Twin Cities in Minnesota, with no logistical problems reported. Demand has come later than expected in some parts of North and South Dakota, with dry conditions in some areas blamed for the slow start.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Importers maintain hard line on prices\\nBrazilian importers of granuar urea are maintaining bids around the $320/mt CFR marker despite offers well into the $330s/mt CFR. Buyers contend that offers at $328/mt CFR were available this week for parcels off inbound carriers, but elected not to pursue the tonnnage even at that number.\\nSales in Indonesia at $308/mt FOB and from Middle East at $310/mt FOB imply costs to traders above $330/mt CFR main Brazilian ports, but the slowdown in inland purchasing continues to impact importers\\' willingness to add to existing length at current values.\\nBrazil: Urea imports continue to decline\\nBrazilian imports of urea through May identified by customs via GTIS of 1.03 million mt declined by close to 34% compared to the first five months of 2014. Imports in May of 179,000 mt were down by 51.8% on May 2014.\\nImports from Qatar in May 2015 of 127,600 mt were nevertheless up by 18% on May 2014, but deliveries from Kuwait of 22,000 mt and from Russia of 21,000 mt in May 2015 were off by 55% and 17.5%, respectively.\\nQatar also maintained the lead position in January-May imports with supplies of 396,000 mt, up by 26% on the same months in 2014. Arrivals from Russia of 245,000 mt were down by 18%, shipments from Oman of 88,400 mt were off by 28.4%, and deliveries originating from Kuwait of 78,600 mt were down by 50.2%.\\nDeliveries from the UAE of 71,200 mt were down by 33% and Venezuela accounted for 44,500 mt down by 70%.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Netbacks dip marginally in new trade\\nNetbacks to producers loading from the Baltic Sea were back down into the $280s/mt FOB this week via a sale in Latin America of a cargo to load in combination with stabilized AN.\\nUralchem was widely suggested as the supplier of both products in the deal concluded with the Mexican Group of Importers. The return to the seller is assessed around $288/mt FOB less transaction costs.\\nBlack Sea: Trade in prills slows on trader resistance\\nTrade in prilled urea from Yuzhnyy has slowed following last week\\'s scramble by a few traders to secure cover for prompt short positions. Netbacks on small sales in regional markets are back down to the low $290s/mt FOB at best as buyers in Mediterranean markets with the ability to receive large carriers resort to premium granular product from Iran to cover requirements.\\nSupply in June and into July does however remain limited, and traders have disposed of prior length.\\nShipments and fully firm nominations for vessels to load from Yuzhnyy/TIS terminals in June are yet to exceed 40,000 mt:\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Forward quotes back down\\nThe forward market for granular urea is back to \"normal\" again with sales for summer positions and beyond around an even €300/mt FCA in the French Bay and in the mid-€290s/mt FCA in southern France.\\nTrade in prompt positions has come to a halt, and the forward values are thus applied this week in the assessment of the FCA price-point.\\nTrades at €302-303/mt FCA reflected delivered values around $325/mt CFR, suggesting netbacks to North African producers below $295/mt FOB. Iranian urea on offer in Turkey this week around $315/mt CFR with credit reaffirmed the perceived market value for the granular material.\\nTurkey: More Iranian granular urea trades\\nA cargo of Iranian granular urea has been sold to importers in southern Turkey around $315/mt CFR including credit. The parcel is likely to be split between two or more receivers. Buying interest is otherwise limited to small parcels of FSU prills for industrial use by importers such as Yildiz and Kastamonu.\\nThe 30,000 mt Iranian cargo will lift imports from Iran further from the 138,000 mt registered by customs via GTIS from January through April, up by a full 516%.\\nTotal January-April urea imports by Turkey of 459,000 mt were nevertheless down by 7.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from Ukraine were up by 9.6% to 236,000 mt and arrivals from China were up from 2,100 mt to 37,200 mt. Russia suffered a major setback with deliveries down by 88.5% to a mere 20,000 mt.\\nApril imports of 103,000 mt were down by 14% on April 2014. Ukraine accounted for 61,400 mt, down\\nby 11.4% while arrivals from Iran of 33,000 mt were up by 721%. Shipments from Russia of a mere 5,000 mt were down by 83%.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Granular values holding reasonably well\\nMiddle East producers continue to cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments above $310/mt FOB, and one sale was concluded at that number this week.\\nReturns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are nevertheless still below $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers maintain a \"wait and see\" attitude.\\nBuyers in Thailand are aiming below $325/mt CFR for spot and contract tonnage, citing this week\\'s sales of Kaltim product for June lifting at $308/mt FOB.\\nSharply contrasting the spot market at $365/st FOB, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in the first half of July are around an even $315/st FOB, indicative of delivered values of $340/mt CFR. This suggests Middle East producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $315/mt FOB.\\nFirm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East that were posted June 11 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $301/mt FOB against bids at $295/mt FOB.\\nAlgeria: Sorfert urea output back up\\nOutput of ammonia and granular urea from the Sorfert I integrated units was back up and running close\\nto the 1.3 million mt/year rated urea capacity June 8, according to the producer. The plants had been down since May 17, following a technical issue.\\nFollowing shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has accepted nominations for four vessels from contract holders Indagro (27,500 mt), Nitron (14,000 mt plus 6,000 mt) and Hermlm (3,000 mt) to load in June.\\nLocal reports suggest a temporary suspension of output at the AOA unit, but this could not be confirmed with the producer.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: May urea imports down yoy but sales increase\\nIndian urea imports in May 2015 of 471,000 mt were down on the 618,000 mt imported in the same month a year earlier, according to the latest provisional FAI trade data. Aggregate April-May 2015 imports marginally in excess of 1 million mt were also down on the 1.49 million mt imported in the first two months of the 2014- 2015 Financial Year (FY).\\nContrasting the lower imports, sales of urea in the first two months of FY 2015-2016 totaled close to 4.6 million mt, up by 22% on the prior year. Sales in May 2015 of around 2.47 million mt were up by about 14% on May 2014.\\nClosing May inventory with individual states was assessed at 425,000 mt, down sharply on the 835,000 mt at the same time in 2014, but those volumes do not take into account material stored in ports and in transit to states.\\nNews on a follow-up tender pursuant to the May 9 IPL session is yet to emerge, but a tender is expected to be issued shortly, likely by STC.\\nThe Indian government has meanwhile cleared continued operations at the three naphtha-based urea units of SPIC, MCFL and MFL until the feedstock can be replaced by natural gas. The units have a combined rated capacity of around 1.5 million mt/year, servicing Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states.\\nNepal: AICL issues a further tender\\nNepalese importer AICL floated a further tender for bagged urea. The session to purchase 25,000 mt bagged prills closes on July 24 at 13:00hrs local time and calls for the urea to be delivered on CIP terms to AICL warehouses at Biratnagar, Birgunj and Bhairahawa.\\nDelivery is requested for about 50% of the quantity within 97 days from L/C issuance, with the balance to be delivered within 20 days thereafter. Offers are to remain valid for 21 days.\\nThe May 7 AICL tender for 35,000 mt bagged urea for delivery to the same warehouses was awarded to Swiss Singapore at the trader\\'s offer at $383.99/mt CIP.\\nPakistan: Government may raise import duty by 2%\\nThe Pakistani government has proposed a 1% increase in the customs duty in the 2015-16 budget to 2% on certain fertilizers including urea, DAP, MOP, NP, and SSP.\\nA final decision on whether to confirm this increase will be taken by June 20. The proposal is just one of a number of tax increases suggested in the budget as the government looks at ways to reduce its fiscal deficit, but there will be opposition to any rise in costs for agricultural inputs.\\nTCP is meanwhile yet to announce dates for the three urea tenders for 50,000 mt each pursuant to the clearance secured from the ECC to proceed with the 150,000 mt procurement, but announcements are expected in June.\\nSri Lanka: MoA June 9 tender heavily oversubscribed\\nThe June 9 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for August distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 398,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 270,000 mt.\\nPrices were widely spread for both grades, ranging from $347.26/mt CFR to $379.50/mt CFR for the granular and from $345.86/mt CFR to $377/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nDreymoor was lowest for the granular at $347.26/mt CFR. This was followed by Quantum at $350.30/mt CFR, and by ETA at $354.87/mt CFR for Middle East product. Dreymoor also submitted the lowest offers for the prills at $345.86/mt CFR while Valency was at $347.77/mt CFR.\\nOffers for the granular also included Liven at $355.43/mt CFR, Ameropa at $357.21/mt CFR, Valency at $356.44-357.33/mt CFR and Dragon at $359.99/mt CFR. All other offers were at/above $360.60/mt CFR.\\nOther offers for prills included Liven at $349.43mt CFR, Ameropa at $352.30/mt CFR, and Quantum at\\n$352.43/mt CFR. AgriComm offered at $352.90/mt CFR and ETA was at $356.87/mt CFR. All other offers were above $359/mt CFR.\\nThe total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading, suggesting netbacks to traders around $295/mt FOB for the prills and a minor premium for the granular.\\nAll offers except those from ETA and Valency specified Chinese origin.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: Importers cite aggressive offers for granular\\nThai importers report offers for Chinese and Indonesian granular urea below $325/mt CFR, and appear in no hurry to add purchases.\\nThe buyers cite ample availability from Indonesia as evidenced via this week\\'s sale in support of calls for lower offers, while sellers cite the same deals with suggestions that these are all covering prior commitments by traders and are therefore setting a definite regional floor for granular values into July.\\nVietnam: Indonesian granular and Chinese prills offers\\nVietnamese importers report lower offers this week for granular urea from Indonesia and for prills from China. Daewoo is reported to have booked 6,000 mt granular urea out of its 16,000 mt $308/mt FOB purchase from Kaltim in the low $320s/mt CFR while Chinese prills for July loading are suggested available as low as $310/mt CFR.\\nIndonesia: Traders buy as Kaltim concedes discount\\nTraders short on prior sales and some adding length purchased several cargoes of granular urea from Kaltim this week as the producer agreed to lower its price target from $313/mt FOB Bontang to $308/mt FOB.\\nCHS booked 30,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim for June shipment at the $308/mt FOB Bontang and Samsung is reported to also have taken 30,000 mt at the same price. The cargoes are allegedly destined for Australia or the US, but the recent sales by the traders to Incofe and Tepeyac suggest that the parcels could head for the west coast of Guatemala and Mexico.\\nDaewoo booked 16,000 mt intended for Vietnam, and Koch took 10,000 mt for Thailand, all for June lifting. Koch also reportedly booked an additional 30,000 mt for July loading with open destination, all at $308/mt FOB Bontang.\\nKaltim had originally been holding out for a $325/mt FOB netback but subsequently reduced the target to $313/mt FOB and then conceded a further $5/mt to $308/mt FOB.\\nChina: Undertone softer but no crash on cards\\nChinese farmers are busy with the wheat harvest, but will be concentrating on application of urea for corn in coming weeks. Mainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern China were up by about RMB 20/mt on last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.\\nDomestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporter, but interest in prills at the higher numbers is limited.\\nOffers for July and August shipment in the June 9 MoA tender in Sri Lanka reflected trader expecations of cover being available well below $295/mt FOB for prills and only marginally higher for granular. Offers for July parcels of prills in Vietnam reflect similar values, if not lower.\\nProspects of an imminent tender in India and the three upcoming sessions in Pakistan for 50,000 mt each have however boosted sellers\\' resolve to hold out for high prices well into July. The major part of tonnage in inventory has already been booked by traders that were short for the previous Indian and Pakistan tenders.\\nDomestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,680-1,700/mt FCA in Shanxi, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. Small sales to regional export markets nevertheless continue to be made at returns below $310/mt FOB.\\nThe softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident via sales of Kaltim urea in Indonesia that were concluded at $308/mt FOB Bontang for the superior quality comparative to that of China Blue. A total of about 116,000 mt did however trade at the $308/mt FOB benchmark for June and July lifting, implying that traders see limited short-term potential for lower prices.\\nInventories in Chinese ports for export have decreased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is still assessed above 250,000 mt with some suggestions that 300,000 mt may be available. Laizhou inventory is assessed at 50,000 mt.\\nAustralia: More granular urea to arrive from Indonesia\\nImports of urea through April identified by customs via GTIS of 493,000 mt in Australia were off by a mere 1% compared to the same period in 2014.\\nThe flurry of activity in Indonesia this week does however suggest an increase in forward volumes as traders CHS, Samsung and possibly Koch appear inclined to ship cargoes purchased from Kaltim for June/July loading to Australia.\\nArrivals from Qatar of 147,000 mt through April were meanwhile down by 29% and deliveries of 123,000 mt from Saudi Arabia were off by 23.5%.\\nImports from the UAE were lifted from zero to 100,000 mt while arrivals from Oman of 14,500 mt were down by 14.5%.\\nMalaysia captured sales of 40,000 mt, up from zero in the first four months of 2014, but deliveries from Indonesia were down by 57.5% to 30,000 mt.\\nThe April volume of 94,700 mt was down by 34.7% on April 2014, with Saudi Arabia accounting for 63,200 mt and Indonesia for 30,000 mt.\\nMalaysia: Urea exports up sharply in March\\nMalaysian exporters enjoyed a significant increase in shipments of urea in March as the Chinese dominance in exports from the region waned on calls for higher netbacks from the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association.\\nThe March volume from Malaysia identified by customs via GTIS of 112,000 mt was up by 295% on March 2014. Shipments to Chile of 27,500 mt were up from zero and deliveries to New Zealand of 27,000 mt were up from 1,700 mt in the prior year. Thailand accounted for 21,300 mt, up by 5.1% and shipments to Australia of 20,000 mt were up from zero.\\nQ1 2015 exports of 299,000 mt were up by 49.7% on Q1 2014 with the Philippines the largest client with 92,000 mt, up by 196%. Shipments to Australia were up from zero to 52,000 mt while the volume of 36,500 mt loaded for Thailand was down by 46.6%. Deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by 49.8%.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Consensus is however building for mainstream numbers well in excess of $315/mt CFR for East Coast India (ECI) ports such as Krishnapatnam offering fast discharge terms. This based on expected FOB values above $300/mt FOB from China.\\nHigher freights for panamax carriers and the supramax segment are indicative of freights around $12/mt from northern China for the larger sizes, and some $2-3/mt more for supramax tonnage. Transaction costs are assessed at $2-3/mt for a package around an even $15/mt with very limited provisions for margins.\\nAvailability from Iran to load by July 27 is assessed below 400,000 mt with costs likely to pan out around $300/mt FOB or marginally lower. Freight is estimated above $10/mt and suppliers of Iranian material also need to factor in provisions for insurance which is for seller\\'s account acording to STC tender terms. This plus transaction charges and the extra costs of processing payments for Iranian material also point to delivered values higher than $315/mt CFR for fast WCI ports.\\nMore aggressive offers from either origin can however not be excluded. Some traders point to added availability of Chinese urea in July as domestic demand wanes, and may elect to short the market down to netbacks available in recent small regional trades around $295/mt FOB, if not lower.\\nOffers for July positions in paper markets for Middle East tonnage posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at an even $300/mt FOB were attracting bids no higher than $295/mt FOB June 18, indicating that competitive offers to STC may also emerge from this source.\\nLimited availability through July from the Black Sea does not suggest competition from FSU tonnage, but offers based on firm quotes in paper markets for July positions at $288-290/mt FOB Yuzhnyy could conceivably match mainstream offers from China for WCI ports basis current freight estimates.\\nThe US market is meanwhile also in traders\\' focus. Soaring values for prompt barge positions, already have attracted tonnage that had originally been planned for delivery to Brazil. Four cargos of granular\\nurea totaling about 110,000 mt previously expected to head for Brazil now are destined for the US from\\nAlgeria, with arrival dates from June 25 to 2H July. The July lineup, fattened somewhat be delays in arrivals from June, has reached 900,000 mt.\\nThis is despite declines in offers for 1H July barges. While barges confirmed for delivery before he July 4 holiday sold around $350/st FOB New Orleans, forward offers of physical tons for 1H July were available at $300-305/st FOB at press time. August offers were cited in the $290s/st FOB, and a physical sale at $295/st FOB was confirmed at press time.\\nMarkets for prilled urea outside India have been less active as traders are unwilling to assume significant risk in adding length or going short ahead of the Indian session.\\nTenders scheduled in Sri Lanka for granular and prilled urea and in Nepal for prills have attracted some attention while the upcoming sessions in Pakistan to procure a further 150,000 mt are yet to be announced.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙STC tender June 19 at center of attention\\n∙US July import lineup reaches 900-950,000 mt, forward offers plunge\\n∙Chinese prills trade at par with regular quality granular, albeit via short positions\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA awards Dreymoor and floats additional tender\\n∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but suggested imminent\\n∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, and AOA output also suggested restored\\n∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line despite diversions of cargos to the US\\n∙Egyptian output still erratic but MOPCO II trials start\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed, but bears outside the US have gathered a slightly larger following than bulls in recent days. Market direction will be clearer June 19 when offers in the STC tender are submitted, but quotes in that session are expected to be relatively widely spread. The general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is still apparent, but the timing remains an open question.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use\\nMarket expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from the US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.\\nUS N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values\\nSpot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.\\nLate season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.\\nUS NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker\\nPush almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June\\n15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.\\nMost or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.\\nBy the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB.\\nPrilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.\\nChina Oil\\'s pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.\\nThe spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo\\narriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July.\\nA rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.\\nUS S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise\\nGranular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.\\nUrea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.\\nPredictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.\\nUS Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike\\nEven though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Diversions of vessels not alarming buyers\\nThe diversions of vessels carrying granular urea originally intended for Brazil from the Middle East and North Africa to the US has yet to impact Brazilian buyers\\' willingness to pay up to secure additional material.\\nOffers in the low $320s/mt CFR tabled by sellers at the end of last week failed to elicit firm buying interest. Importers indicate that quotes marginally below $320/mt CFR are currently available, despite the\\nrecent increase in freights for large carriers loading from the Middle East and other regional sources.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Regional demand supports exports\\nWhile down on the March volume, April exports of urea from Belarus identified by customs via GTIS close to 6,000 mt were up on April 2014. The entire quantity was delivered to Poland.\\nThis lifted January-April exports to 151,000 mt, up by a full 221% on the prior year. Poland accounted for 60,000 mt, Germany for 24,000 mt and Lithuania for 15,000 mt.\\nRussia: Exports of urea through April down by 19.3%\\nCompetition from other sources such as China in Q1 saw Russian urea exports as identified by customs via GTIS drop by 19.3% to 1.39 million mt in the first four months of 2015.\\nThe firmer stance on pricing adopted by Chinese sellers did however help to trigger Russian April exports of 364,000 mt, down by a mere 0.8% on April 2014. Deliveries to Mexico, partly replacing Chinese granular and Ukrainian prills of 49,000 mt were up by 68% on April 2014. Deliveries to Brazil were down by 3.2% to 42,000 mt but exports to Canada of 28,500 mt were up sharply on the prior year. Deliveries to Turkey of a mere 20,000 mt were down by 70% due to competition from China and Iran.\\nBrazil accounted for 277,000 mt out of the January-April volume, down by 14% on the same period in 2014. Deliveries to the US of 158,000 mt were down by 33.2% but shipments to Germany of 158,000 mt were up by a substantial 53%. Despite the April surge, Mexico accounted for 76,000 mt in January-April, down by 53% on the first four months of 2014. Deliveries to Turkey of 45,000 mt were down by 70%.\\nBlack Sea: Traders hold off despite limited availability\\nTraders are in no rush to add Black Sea prilled tonnage for June and July despite lower offers from producers and marketers. Offers to secure repeat business in the low $290s/mt FOB have yet to trigger significant buying interest.\\nPaper markets are also indicative of subdued activity ahead of tomorrow\\'s tender in India. Firm offers for July positions from Yuzhnyy that were posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $290/mt FOB attracted bids at $285/mt FOB while the bid-offer spread for August was $280-$285/mt FOB.\\nThe lineup for June loading is close to 72,000 mt following the addition of the Dreymoor vessel to load for NF for Italy:\\nEUROPE\\nSpain: March imports up\\nImports of urea by Spain identified by Eurostat via GTIS in March of 82,400 mt were up by 14.6% on March 2014, but Q1 imports of 307,800 mt nevertheless lagged Q1 2014 by 4.16%.\\nRussia accounted for 15,500 mt of the March volume, up by 174% on March 2014 and deliveries from Ukraine were up from zero to 14,000 mt. Arrivals from Germany were up by 108% to 22,200 mt but arrivals from Egypt were down by 72.6% to a mere 4,200 mt.\\nAlgeria accounted for 67,400 mt out of the Q1 2015 volume, up by 146% on the prior year while arrivals from Germany were up by 24.8% to 46,000 mt.\\nRussia accounted for 31,000 mt and Ukraine for 28,600 mt. Deliveries from Egypt were down by 80% to 15,000 mt and arrivals from the UAE were down to zero from 30,000 mt in Q1 2014.\\nRomania: Q1 exports down\\nRomanian exports of urea continued to fall in Q1 2015, with the 44,500 mt exported in the quarter identified by Eurostat via GTIS down by 77% on Q1 2014. March exports of a mere 12,800 mt were down by 84.5% on March 2014, and were shipped almost entirely to nearby, inland markets.\\nSerbia accounted for 19,500 mt of the Q1 volume, up by 52%, but other markets registered significant declines. Shipments to the US dropped from 51,000 mt in Q1 2014 to zero in 2015 and deliveries to Turkey were down from 37,600 mt to 2,900 mt.\\nGermany: Urea Q1 exports lower but imports are up\\nExports of urea from Germany identified via Eurostat via GTIS were down by 5.8% through Q1 while imports registered an increase of 11.25%.\\nMarch exports of 76,200 mt were off by 12.5% and Q1 exports of 223,400 mt were off by 5.8%. The UK took delivery of 35,100 mt in the quarter, down by 23% while shipments to Canada of 33,000 mt were up by 50% and deliveries to Poland of 23,000 mt were down by 13.5%.\\nMarch imports of 87,800 mt were up by 22.8% on the prior year with deliveries from Iran of 19,700 mt up from zero and arrivals from Belarus up from 3,000 mt to 18,300 mt. Russia accounted for 16,700 mt, down by 45.8%.\\nQ1 imports of 257,000 mt were up by 11.25%. Russian arrivals of 98,000 mt remained in the lead, but were off by 4.5%. Deliveries from the Netherlands of 33,000 mt were down by 25% while arrivals from Belarus of 30,400 mt were up by 402%.\\nCroatia: Q1 exports down on 2014\\nCroatian exports of urea in Q1 2015 of 64,100 mt identified by customs via GTIS were down by 28.6% on the Q1 2014 volume. Serbia accounted for 28,600 mt, followed by Italy with 9,800 mt and Austria with 9,600 mt. Exports to Turkey were not registered in Q1 but these will appear April onwards following numerous small sales of prills, mainly to industrial customers.\\nUK: Urea imports up through April\\nUrea imports by the UK in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 44,800 mt were up by 43.3% on April 2014 and January-April imports of 323,500 mt were up by 44.2% on the same period in the prior year.\\nGermany accounted for 19,100 mt of the April volume, up by 45% on April 2014 while deliveries from Netherlands of 10,000 mt were up by 51%. Arrivals from Poland of 3,600 mt were down by 50%.\\nRussian arrivals in January-April of 80,400 mt were up by 142% and shipments originating in Netherlands of 57,800 mt were up by 42.3%. Deliveries from Germany of 51,500 mt were off by 3% while arrivals from Egypt of 27,400 mt were up by 5.3%. Arrivals from Qatar and Algeria of 24,200 mt and 24,000 mt were up from zero in the prior year.\\nNetherlands: Urea Q1 exports up sharply\\nExports of urea from the Netherlands identified by Eurostat via GTIS in Q1 2015 of 607,500 mt were up by a massive 88% on Q1 2014.\\nMarch exports of 141,300 mt were up by 6.7%. March deliveries to Belgium of 24,000 mt were up by 27.7% and deliveries to Spain were up by 32%.\\nBelgium was also the biggest outlet for Q1 exports with 108,000 mt while Germany accounted for 80,000 mt, the UK for 76,400 mt and France for 68,500 mt.\\nItaly: Prompt demand tapers off as season ends\\nDemand for prompt positions of granular urea has tapered off in Italy as application for corn has essentially ended. Buyers are concentrating on vacation-plans rather than urea purchasing at present.\\nThe flurry of activity in March and April is already reflected in March import data provided by Eurostat via GTIS. March urea imports of 113,000 mt were up by 32.8% on March 2014 with Iran taking the lead with 26,300 mt, up from zero. Deliveries from Ukraine of 24,600 mt were down by 10.4% but arrivals from Russia of 23,600 mt were up by 322% on March 2014.\\nQ1 imports of 246,600 mt were nevertheless down by 18.2% on Q1 2014. Ukraine accounted for 66,600 mt, down by 31.4% but Russia was up by a massive 485% on the prior year to reach 56,400 mt and deliveries from Iran were up from zero to 31,000 mt. Egypt continued to suffer from limited availability and saw shipments drop by 80% to 23,300 mt. Deliveries from China were up from zero to 17,400 mt while Croatian imports dived by 71.5% to 9,800 mt.\\nFrance: Trade in granular subdued and imports slow\\nTrades in granular urea in France remains slow as importers hold off on forward purchasing. Trades are suggested by suppliers around an even €300/mt FCA, but distributors contend that offers closer to €290/mt FCA are freely available for the summer months.\\nImports of urea in April identitied by Eurostat via GTIS close to 160,000 mt were meanwhile down by about 13% on April 2014. Imports from Algeria of 25,700 mt were down marginally on March 2014, while imports from Oman and Kuwait jumped from zero to 24,000 mt and 21,000 mt, respectively.\\nJanuary-April imports of 544,000 mt were down by about 11% on the same period in 2014 but deliveries from Algeria of 123,000 mt were up by 7.1%. Arrivals\\nfrom Russia of 72,500 mt were down by 43.6% and shipments of 52,500 mt from Netherlands were off by 31%. Deliveries from Egypt of 41,500 mt were down by 69%.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Sorfert sees regular output, more nominations\\nSorfert reports regular output of urea following the May closure due to technical issues, and the producer\\'s shipping programme for June continues to build, albeit at a relatively slow pace.\\nFollowing shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has loaded/accepted nominations for six vessels for a total close to 75,000 mt from contract holders Indagro (27,800 mt), Koch (16,000 mt), Nitron (15,400 mt plus 6,600 mt), Keytrade (4,000 mt) and Helm (3,400 mt) to load in June.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: MoA awards Dreymoor, issues new tender\\nThe MoA elected to award the June 9 tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags to Dreymoor at the trader\\'s lowest offers in the session based on 270 days credit. A new tender for 48,000 mt granular urea plus 12,000 prilled urea in bags is set to close June 29.\\nDreymoor booked the granular urea in the June 9 session at $347.26/mt CFR and the prills at $345.86/mt CFR, both inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nThe June 29 tender requests offers for the tonnage to be available in Sri Lanka for local distribution in bags by the end of September, and also includes a requirement for TSP and MOP.\\nPakistan: Fertilizers exempt from added tax\\nFurther to the June 9 update regarding the possible 1% increase in the import tariff for fertilizers for 2015- 2016, news from Pakistan indicates that the government has elected not to include Agricultural inputs - including fertilizers - in the proposed tariff increase. The tax on imported urea will therefore remain unchanged at 1%.\\nTCP tenders for the additional 150,000 mt cleared for import by the ECC are meanwhile yet to be issued.\\nIndia: STC floats urea tender to close June 19\\nThe long awaited tender for urea by STC to complement prior IPL purchases was issued June 12. The session calls for offers for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by July 27. Offers are to be submited by 11:00hrs Indian Standard Time on June 19 and are to remain valid through June 23.\\nIndian urea producer National Fertilizers Ltd. has meanwhile reported that its 510,000 mt/year Bathinda urea plant in Punjab that closed down for maintenance May 11 resumed production June 7.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Corn application set to taper off\\nDomestic prices for prilled urea are relatively stable but are expected to ease into July when application for corn will end. Trades in northern China are reported at RMB 1,700-1,730/mt ($274-279/mt) EXW\\nwhile business was done in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.\\nOffers for prills for export were available at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main northern ports, indicative of an export value around $307/mt FOB plus costs/margins to intermediaries.\\nTrades into regional markets such as Taiwan and Vietnam were nevertheless reported at netbacks down to about $295/mt FOB, but these are widely expected to be short sales by traders expecting a softer forward market once domestic demand for corn application eases.\\nTrades in granular positions in Shanxi were concluded above those for prills, with parcels changing hands at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) FCA, suggesting export values at a mere $3/mt premium on prilled values. Netbacks on recent export deals are around $307/mt FOB for regular quality while premium granular quality has traded again above the $310/mt FOB marker.\\nInventories at ports are also stable on last week with about 300,000 mt indicated available for shipment from Yantai and Quinhuangdao with the majority in the form of granular urea.\\nExporters and traders are busy formulating strategies for the June 19 STC tender in India that permits loading through July 27. Mainstream offers are expected to be based on netbacks to producers above $305/mt FOB, but some traders may opt to consider taking short positions at returns down into the $290s/mt FOB. Freights for the supramax and panamax segments are up further over the last two weeks, suggesting rates closer to $15/mt rather than $10/mt for fast ports on East Coast India.\\nNew Zealand: Ballance in talks with suppliers\\nBallance Agri-Nutrients has been in discussions with suppliers pursuant to a June 17 request for offers for around 25,000 mt granular urea for July shipment. A deal for the cargo to load from Malaysia or Indonesia has been suggested, but could not be verified with the importer at press time.\\nTaiwan: TFC awards June 15 tender\\nThe June 15 TFC tender for 6,000 mt prilled urea for June or early July loading is reported to have resulted in an award to a trader offering Chinese urea around $318-320/mt CFR. The price suggested reflects a producer netback marginally above $295/mt FOB if loaded from a northern port in China.\\nImports of urea in April ascertained by customs via GTIS of a mere 7,500 mt were down by 60% on April 2014. Deliveries from China in April accounted for 7,300 mt. The April volume brought January-April imports to 35,600 mt, down by close to 50% on the same period in 2014, with China supplying 34,700 mt.\\nVietnam: More Indonesian granular urea trades\\nKoch is linked with sales of about 20,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim production for June/July loading to importers in Vietnam. A further deal for 10,000 mt is being negotiated.\\nExact details on the transactions were not released, but the sales were reported concluded marginally below $330/mt CFR, to be shipped in lots of 6-10,000 mt each.\\nAn offer for Chinese prills are suggested available for a small 3,000 mt lot from a Korean trader down to $310/mt CFR while parcels of 6-7,000 mt are on offer around $315/mt CFR, in line with this week\\'s sale in Taiwan.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae to test prilled values\\nNamhae will be seeking to improve on offers submitted to TFC in Taiwan for prilled urea around $317/mt CFR when tendering to buy 6,000 mt prills via tender June 19.\\nSouth Korean imports of urea in May 2015 registered by customs via GTIS of 56,500 mt, all from China, were meanwhile up by 3.5% on May 2014. This brought the January-May 2015 volume to 376,000 mt, up by 4% on the same months in 2014.\\nChina accounted for 346,400 mt of the\\n2015 total, up by 24%, while deliveries from Qatar of 25,000 mt were down by 57.6%.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The impact is likely to be felt by suppliers from most sources, but the main question faced by producers, endusers and traders is whether US prices will adjust down by a similar factor or if that market will provide a safe haven for cargoes seeking a home.\\nWhile nowhere near the $80/st collapse in US barge numbers last week, the $20-22/mt drop in Brazilian CFR numbers occured in a market that was already substantially below delivered prices into the US Gulf.\\nFreight to Brazil and the US Gulf from the Middle East do not differ substantially. The $290/mt CFR deal booked in Brazil this week would therefore reflect barge values in the US no higher than $270/st FOB. This is substantially below even the more pessimistic outlooks for July. Trades in August barge-tonnage and beyond in the US have however been concluded in the mid-$280s/st FOB, suggesting a distinct possibility of convergience for CFR values in Brazil and the US Gulf.\\nThe aforementioned $290/mt CFR price for Brazil did grab the attention of US traders. Indications for August and September barges moved down from the high to low $280s/st FOB New Orleans late this week. However, the biggest difference in coming weeks for the US Gulf should be the elimination of the large price spread as cargos now are making up for the supply shortage seen during most of June.\\nIt may of course be argued that this week\\'s sales of Middle East granular urea in Latin America do not representy the actual market and that the disposal of length was out of desperation rather than rational business decisions. Importers\\' ability to hold off on additional purchases on the back of significant existing inventory do however suggest that this week\\'s sales may be difficult if not impossible to repeat in the short term.\\nThe impact on other sources of supply will be significant if Middle East values were to stabilize in the mid $270s/mt FOB or even in the mid-$280s/mt CFR. The latter would imply offers for key destinations such as India back into the low $290s/mt CFR from the most recent sales above $315/mt CFR. This would in turn reflect Chinese netbacks no higher than $280/mt FOB and FSU Black Sea returns some $10-15/mt lower, depending on cargo-size and discharge terms.\\nChinese sellers are already fighting an uphill battle to sustain netbacks at or above $300/mt FOB, and traders appear happy to short forward positions some $15/mt lower, as was evidenced via low offers in the\\nJune 29 MoA tender in Sri Lanka that permitted shipment into September. Small sales of Chinese prills and granular in regional markets for July loading reflected similar sentiment.\\nUrea application on corn in China is about to end, and domestic demand has already tapered off from recent peaks, resulting in lower quotes, also for export. This suggests a return to export potential in excess of 1 million mt/month, a volume that will fight for outlets with product from other sources that are due to ramp up exports in coming months.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Brazilian prices nosedive to an even $290/mt CFR\\n∙Argentine importers book granular at $300/mt CFR ahead of Brazil deal\\n∙US barge-values heading closer to $300/st as short positions covered\\n∙Chinese supply limited to 425,000 mt in the STC session in India\\n∙Chinese prills continue to trade at par with regular quality granular\\n∙Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea to load by December in formula-deals\\n∙Prompt FSU prills trade in Turkey at netbacks in low $280s/mt FOB\\n∙Ukraine rejects Gazprom offer for gas at $247.18/\\'000 cbm at border\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tender June 29 oversubscribed at $10/mt discount on June 9 session\\n∙Pakistan Kharif availability finely balanced but TCP tenders yet to emerge\\n∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, but AOA output is awaiting restart\\n∙Egyptian output still erratic as government cuts gas further\\nShort term outlook\\nSofter still, and global values may still need to be corrected from some origins. Trader length rather than producer inventories triggered the most recent corrections, but continued oversupply though Q3 leaves little room for a rebound any time soon.\\nAmple pipeline stocks in most key markets outside the US imply that importers can continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations. Pockets of short positions could conceivably result in some upward voltaility, but the overall trend points south.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports\\nA 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.\\nMarket sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.\\nUS N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets\\nForward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.\\nIt is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.\\nUS NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected\\nBy the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week\\'s close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.\\nAt the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.\\nFor months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.\\nMarket rumours regarding the start-up of CF\\'s urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.\\nUS S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks\\nEven though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week\\'s market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.\\nTravel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.\\nUS Midwest: Late demand holding prices up\\nGranular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.\\nNevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: Imports down\\nJanuary-April imports by Colombia as ascertained by customs via GTIS of 109,000 mt were down by a full 35.6% on the same period in 2014. Imports from China were nevertheless up by 50% to 55,500mt.\\nDeliveries from Venezuela were off by 47% to 41,000 mt and arrivals from Russia were down by 70% to a mere 11,000 mt. There were no shipments from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 9,400 mt in the same period in 2014.\\nApril arrivals of 38,000 mt were off by 35.8%, including 20,400 mt from China, down by by 44.6% and deliveries from Venezuela were off by 70% to 6,600 mt. Russia accounted for 11,000 mt, up from zero in April 2014.\\nArgentina: Nitron widely associated with new sales\\nNitron is widely suggested as the supplier of about 30,000 mt granular urea from Oman to two buyers in Argentina. The price secured was around an even $300/mt CFR, and the trader has fixed a vessel which is due to load from Sohar in July laydays.\\nBrazil: Seller concedes $290/mt CFR deal\\nThe \"wait and see\" attitude adopted by Brazilian buyers of granular urea has paid off, yet again. Importers cited abundant availability of offers significantly below last week\\'s quotes at $308-313/mt CFR early in the week, and a part cargo of 8,000 mt was booked July 2 by a major trader with Fertipar at an even $290/mt CFR.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Activity at low ebb, but netbacks suffer\\nA 10,000 mt cargo sold by a trader for southern Turkey around an even $295/mt CFR July 2 reflected netbacks to producers at an even $280/mt FOB from Yuzhnyy, but the trader may have been disposing of a prior position at a loss.\\nOffers from producers in the low $290s/mt FOB earlier in the week were not eliciting firm counters from traders that cited netbacks marginally above $280/mt FOB in support of calls for lower prices.\\nWhile the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/\\'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/\\'000 cbm CPT. The Ukrainian government did however opt not to go for the Russian offer, citing ample opportunities to secure gas from other sources.\\nMay shipments from Yuzhnyy panned out a shade short of 100,000 mt. July nominations are so far limited to the 8,000 mt currently loading from OPZ for Koch, originally destined to Italy, but the vessel may be diverted to Turkey:\\nEUROPE\\nUK: Offers claimed abundant at low numbers\\nUK importers claim that offers for granular urea for delivery in July and beyond are still abundant well below GBP 230/mt FCA in bags.\\nA second large cargo of Algerian urea is to arrive in July off the Lucky Trader for Koch from Sorfert. Koch is also loading the SDS Wind with 7,000 mt from Sorfert, but that vessel likely heads for France.\\nA GBP 230/mt FCA suggests a delivered value around $320/mt CIF while freight from Algeria is estimated in excess of $35/mt for a regular-size carrier.\\nTurkey: Buyers aim for lower numbers\\nTrade in prilled urea in Turkey is slow, and is mainly restricted to industrial buying, including some quantities required for NPK production.\\nQuotes to importers in southern Turkey were down by more than $10/mt from last week\\'s $308/mt CFR with 180 days, duty unpaid.\\nMainstream buyers were aiming for cover around $295/mt CFR, also with credit, for prompt positions, and are holding off on forward requirements. One cargo of 10,000 mt was suggested booked July 2 at the $295/mt CFR number including 180 days.\\nFrance: Trade slows further and prices inch lower\\nRepeat sales of July positions have been concluded at €295-298/mt FCA, but buyers are aiming for €285/mt FCA for August and beyond. The €295/mt FCA reflects about $315/mt CIF, duty paid, with no provisions for margins and financing.\\nTrade in Mediterranen ports is also seasonally slow, with offers from inventory around €290/mt FCA for a $310/mt CFR equivalent, duty paid.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Safco V urea further delayed\\nAs highlighted in the July 1 news update from Fertilizer Week, the start-up of Safco V’s 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has been delayed further.\\nFollowing production trials through June, commercial output at the facility has been pushed back to some time in July, according to a press release issued by the producer.\\nMiddle East: Producers face further price-deterioration\\nNetbacks to Middle East producers on cargoes priced via formula moved down further this week while spot purchasing remained subdued.\\nFirm offers and a subsequent sale in Brazil down to an even $290/mt CFR and two deals concluded in Argentina at $300/mt CFR are indicative of returns back down in the $270s/mt FOB versus the low end of last week estimated at $290/mt FOB.\\nImporters in Thailand also maintain a \"wait and see\" attitude and are in no hurry to secure additional parcels of granular urea, and cite ample quantity in warehouses in support of calls for lower quotes.\\nProducers are generally quite comfortable into July, but traders holding contract length that are struggling to place tonnage in Latin America had no choice but to accept the low bids in Brazil and Argentina.\\nWhile also heading further south, barge values for vessels discharging in the US in the second half of July are assessed no lower than $300/st FOB this week. This suggests a delivered value close to $325/mt CFR for producer-returns marginally below $300/mt FOB. Trades in barges concluded for August delivery at $285-288/st FOB New Orleans are indicative of netbacks no higher than $285/mt FOB Middle East.\\nOne Contract of Affreightment (CoA) for four to five cargoes of 40-45,000 mt loading from Ruwais for the US has been fixed in the very low $20s/mt and a second CoA is likely to be finalised shortly at similar numbers, also from Ruwais.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: Kharif availability finely tuned\\nUrea offtake in Pakistan was 422,000 mt in May 2015, up by 3.3% on deliveries in May 2014, according to latest statistics from the National Fertilizer Development Centre (NFDC). The April-May Kharif offtake of 788,000 mt was up by 18.4% on the 666,000 mt delivered in the same period in 2014.\\nNFDC estimated urea availability in May 2015 at 745,000 mt. This included an opening inventory of 356,000 mt and local production of 389,000 mt. No imports were recorded in May. The May 2015 closing balance was assessed at 323,000 mt.\\nDomestic production for the April-September 2015 Kharif season was assessed at 2.45 million mt for a total availability including carryover and imports marginally above 3 million mt. Full Kharif offtake is projected at 2.9 million mt, indicative of an opening inventory ahead of Rabi of a mere 102,000 mt.\\nKharif imports are projected at 341,000 mt, inclusive of the 91,000 imported in April. Dreymoor and Samsung are each supplying 50,000 mt via awards in the May 29 and June 1 TCP tenders, and TCP is expected to tender shortly for the 150,000 mt cleared for import by the Economic Coordination Committee in June.\\nSri Lanka: Transmart offers lowest in both MoA tenders\\nThe June 29 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 12,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for September distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 420,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 180,000 mt.\\nTransmart offered the lowest price in both sessions on both a 270 and 180 day credit basis.\\nPrices ranged from $336.29/mt CFR to $359.00/mt CFR for the granular and from $335.29/mt CFR to $364/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nTransmart\\'s price for the 36,000 mt granular was $336.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days credit with Chinese product.\\nTrammo and Agri Commodities submitted the next two lowest offers at $336.75 and $337.00/mt CFRFO with 270 days respectively. Trammo offered Indonesian/Chinese product.\\nTransmart was also the lowest for the 12,000 mt prills/granular at $335.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days offering Uzbek product. The next lowest in this session was Dragon Fertilizers with Chinese at $338.13/mt CFRFO followed by AgriCommodities with Chinese at $340.50/mt CFRFO both with 270 days.\\nThe total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading suggesting netbacks in the mid $280s/mt FOB, some $10/mt below the lowest offers in the June 9 tender.\\nImports of urea into Sri Lanka in April identified by cutoms via GTIS in April of 61,000 mt were up by 58.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from the UAE accounted for 35,600 mt with the balance emanating from China.\\nJanuary-April imports of 138,400 mt were nevertheless down by 8.6% on the prior year, but deliveries from China were up by 353% to 103,000 mt. UAE arrivals were off by 66% to the 35,600 mt imported in April.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nNew Zealand: No new deals and May imports very low\\nThere have been no new sales of urea reported since the Trammo sale to Ballance pursuant to the June 17 negotiations. May imports identified by customs via GTIS were meanwhile limited to a mere 1,500 mt, down from 51,000 mt in May 2014.\\nJanuary-May imports of 183,000 mt were also lower, but only down by 8.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 123,000 mt were down by 48% while deliveries from China of 29,600 mt were up by 9%. Shipments originating in Malaysia of 26,600 mt were up by 61%.\\nThailand: Urea buyers still appear in no hurry\\nImporters in Thailand concede that there is demand for additional tonnage, but buyers continue to decline offers into the low $310s/mt CFR. Indications of possible interest in spot positions are in line with Brazilian bids well below $300/mt CFR, but sellers are holding out for better returns.\\nImports of urea in May meanwhile reached 310,000 mt, up by 25% on May 2014. Deliveries from Saudi Arabia accounted for 134,000 mt, up by 52%, and shipments from Kuwait of 61,500 mt were up from zero in May 2014. Indonesia suffered a major setback with deliveries dropping from 42,200 mt to a mere 3,600 mt.\\nThe January-May volume of 861,000 mt was down by 3.6% on the prior year but delivereis from Saudi were up by close to 1% to 385,000 mt. Arrivals from Malaysia of 125,000 mt were off by 18% and Qatar lost about 9.3% with shipments of 124,000 mt.\\nOman advanced from zero to 52,000 mt while China shipped 35,600 mt, a 38.5% drop. Indonesian arrivals of 33,300 mt were off by 50%.\\nPhilippines: Demand expected to improve\\nUrea demand in the Philippines remains low, and trading is limited to small parcels of prills changing hand ahead of the rainy season. Replacement cargoes will need to be procured once movements to farms start in earnest, and volumes are expected to improve.\\nSellers of inventory continue to hold out for prices in the $330s/mt CFR equivalent, but indications of interest from importers for forward positions are lower.\\nChina: Domestic and export values slip further\\nDomestic and export values for prilled and granular urea tapered off further this week as the end of domestic corn application nears. Asking prices remained unchanged for prills around RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern provinces, but trades were confirmed down to RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) EXW and at RMB 1,570/mt ($253/mt) EXW in Henan.\\nTrades in prilled and granular urea in Shanxi were completed at par with last week at RMB 1,630-1,640/mt ($263-265/mt) FCA, mainly destined for delivery to ports for export.\\nValues for prills and granular delivered into ports were largely identical around RMB 1,700/mt CPT, indicative of an export price around an even $300/mt FOB for both grades, plus a margin for an exporter.\\nRepeat export-trades in prilled and granular urea are confirmed to traders short for prompt loading for India around $302/mt FOB, and in the high $290s/mt FOB for full July loading. Traders are however evidently convinced that forward coverage will be available at significantly lower numbers.\\nSales in South Korea this week of 3,000 mt granular and 2,000 mt prills were indicative of netbacks in the low $290s/mt FOB, and the most competitive offers in the June 29 Sri Lankan tender reflected expectations of August and September availability at or below $285/mt FOB.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea\\nThe Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of 360,000 mt granular urea for loading through mid-December to be priced via formula resulted in awards to four traders. The session called for bids for premiums to be paid on top of prices established via a formula.\\nThe formula applies average published FOB values for granular urea in Southeast Asia and the Middle East for two weeks ahead of the date of presentation of Notice of Readiness by each carrier nominated.\\n∙Ameropa bid at a premium of $1.00/mt above the formula price and was awarded 150,000 mt\\n∙Koch bid at an initial premium of $0.80/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 90,000 mt\\n∙EuroChem bid at an initial premium of $0.40/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt\\n∙Dreymoor bid at an initial premium of $0.10/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt\\nKaltim retains the right not to sell/deliver under formula allocations if the formula averages plus the premium agreed result in netbacks below the producer\\'s minimum price. This will be calculated on the basis of returns achieved in the month prior to the actual month of nominations/planned shipments under the formula.\\nSwiss Singapore and CHS submitted bids in the initial round, but did not match the Ameropa proposal.

However, inland prices in that region and elsewhere would support substantially higher barge values at this stage. This suggests pressure from other market forces or doubts about market direction among at least a few players.\\nApril barge positions trading into the $260s/st FOB imply delivered values below $290/mt CFR, suggesting netbacks to producers below $265/mt FOB Middle East to provide an intermediary with a small margin.\\nNetbacks to regional producers did also slide further on lower regional prices, and theoretical netbacks from Europe were also lower despite a gain in the value of the euro that did provide some initial benefit to US dollar-based suppliers.\\nEuropean buyers were however quick to point out that lower international prices should be reflected in delivered values, and argued that CIF numbers should be adjusted accordingly.\\nFierce competition on sales from prior inventories prevail in key markets such as Turkey and Italy, where traders holding stocks from high-priced imports are facing significant losses when disposing of material in store. Prices in Italy dipped below a $315/mt CIF duty unpaid equivalent this week, suggesting hits into the $60s/mt on some of the tonnage purchased earlier from China, Iran and Russia. Some suppliers nevertheless continue to add to stocks, likely in moves to relieve inventories at production units and loadports.\\nMediterranen values are nevertheless assessed up on prior weeks, but this refers to the current absence of low-priced offers from Iran into the region. Reports of repeat offers at last week\\'s $305/mt CFR duty paid assessment could not be confirmed at press time.\\nAs indicated last week, prospects of lower short-term demand from the US and Brazil will coincide with output from Safco V, currently undergoing pre-commissioning trials, and trials are also proceeding well at the Oman-Algeria joint venture units. Issues with ammonia output at three units in Qatar are also likely to be resolved by early April, increasing urea output back up to rated capacity.\\nEgyptian producers are again suffering from cuts in natural gas, but imported LNG should alleviate some of those problems, as suggested in several prior issues. Major exports are however not expected in the short term, as financial constraints will continue to limit possible imports of urea and AN, necessitating maximum allocations of urea from indigenous units.\\nEast of Suez, the disparity between netbacks in the domestic market in China and returns form export trades continues to grow, but the inflow of material to ports for export is yet to be materially influenced by the spread. Demand for spring direct application will prevail for some time still, but prospects of directing significant additional volumes at current prices to the domestic market appear limited. A sizeable increase in availability would likely trigger some domestic price deterioration.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nOffers into the export market are however up on the levels at which traders were prepared to short the market or dispose of inventories last week. Granular urea is relatively stable around an even $280/mt FOB and traders that shorted prills down to the low $260s/mt FOB and beyond are so far unable to secure profitable cover. Indications from sellers for late April and May positions based on lower raw material costs are however still suggested into the $260s/mt FOB for prills while granular was indicated available around $275/mt FOB.\\nFSU prilled values were relatively stable week-on-week via sales from the Baltic at producer-netbacks into the upper $250s/mt FOB for prills while granular traded at $280/mt FOB. Black Sea prices have so far been holding up better, but deterioration below the $263/mt FOB low end in recent assessments can still not be excluded.\\nHighlights of the Week\\nA slow week, but downward trend yet to ease\\nUS barge values lose ground despite profitable inland prices. Middle East netbacks adjust accordingly for US-bound parcels Egyptian granular trades at $300/mt FOB for the Mediterranean\\nBrazilian delivered values down further\\nQafco II, V and VI ammonia units due to restart soon SIUCI books cargo with Quantum to be priced ahead of loading\\nEuropean granular values up marginally on stronger euro Traders holding length face major losses in Italy and Turkey Tenders in India and Pakistan yet to emerge\\nGranular urea trades lower in South Korea Domestic/export price-spread in China increases All-time-high Chinese exports through February\\nShort term outlook\\nThe urea market remains supply-driven. Demand is perceived stable to low in key import markets, but further deterioration in delivered values is expected to trigger some emergence of pent-up demand.\\nAs is evident from the various country-entries in this report, sentiment in paper markets this week spell doom and gloom across the board, but some of the more pessimistic views may well be ahead of reality as may emerge.\\nA major rebound in values outside the US is however unlikely in the short term unless recent events in the Middle East significantly impact energy prices to trigger accelerated purchasing by endusers fearing substantial increases in feedstock costs.\\nUS granular urea prices appear to have the best prospects for short to medium term improvement, but some traders continue to sell barges at lower levels despite more profitable options in the US interior.\\nKey Urea Tenders: March-May 2015\\nUREA | 3\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nP = Prills G = Granular TBA = To Be Advised TBC = To Be Confirmed\\nUREA | 4\\nMARKET UPDATES\\nTHE AMERICAS\\nUS MIDWEST\\nMovement expected soon for corn, spring wheat in US Midwest\\nGranular urea values still are cited at $330-335/st FOB from river terminals along the upper Mississippi River, but higher prices remain the rule from inland warehouses in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana and Ohio, as well as from most warehouses in Wisconsin and Michigan.\\nField work likely will get underway for urea applications within days, but ammonia movement is dominating the nitrogen market across the regions for now. Urea still is favored for spring wheat and in the western reaches of the Midwest.\\nIt remains to be seen if the lower prices seen for replacement tons out of the US Gulf put even more downward pressure on inland prices.\\nUS NOLA\\nCheaper barges rule again in New Orleans market\\nGranular urea barges are cheaper again this week, with trade confirmed at $268-286/st FOB New Orleans by traders for prompt, non-Chinese loads. This is $8-9/st below the bottom end of last week\\'s range and $18-19/st below that week\\'s midpoint. The lowest priced sale of Chinese granular urea was reported at $272/st FOB this week.\\nEven though traders do not report a substantial lineup of unsold barges along the lower Mississippi River, the number of bids has been modest due to wet weather in much of the Southern Plains market. This has delayed seasonal demand in that region.\\nThe decline in US values still leaves Middle East producers with a modest incentive to favor sales to the US versus many other world markets.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nUS SOUTHERN PLAINS\\nFlat pricing for prompt and forward truckloads\\nGranular urea quotes for trucks to be loaded in April or May are cited at $330/st FOB by some suppliers along the Arkansas River this week. Slightly higher prices for prompt material are reported in Texas and Arkansas.\\nWet weather has delayed demand in Oklahoma and elsewhere.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBALTIC SEA\\nGrodno indicates high netbacks from overland markets\\nThe March 24 GrodnoAzot tender for the sale of up to 25,000 mt granular urea did not result in sales of major quantities for destinations serviced by shipment from Klaipeda. The producer did however suggest that small lots for overland delivery to nearby Baltic markets were booked in the session at FCA values from the plant indicative of netbacks above a $290/mt FOB Klaipeda equivalent.\\nThe session called for bids for the material to be loaded from the plant March-April, and requested 100% prepayment in euro latest within March 27.\\nThe suggested Grodno deals have not been taken into account in assessing the granular urea value. This has been based on known trades for deliveries via vessel, and on netbacks in recent sales.\\nPrilled values are also assessed basis trades concluded on CFR terms by producers and marketers.\\nBLACK SEA\\nProducers yet to accept calls for discounts\\nTraders short on prior sales in nearby markets from the Black Sea are so far fighting an uphill battle to secure cover at numbers generating margins. Most recent deals in Turkey were indicative\\nUREA | 5\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nof returns to the sellers in the low $260s/mt FOB, necessitating cover in the $250s/mt FOB. Bids for additional quantities from Turkish buyers reflect netbacks some $5/mt lower.\\nProducers and marketers are holding out for returns in line with last week\\'s deals, at a minimum of $263/mt FOB, and some quotes are still closer to $270/mt FOB. Given the lack of alternative outlets, short traders do however appear set to win the game for lower April prices at the end.\\nThe perceived trend is evident in paper markets. Offers for April Yuzhnyy positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $255/mt FOB were countered with bids at $248/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $240/mt-$250/mt FOB and May was posted at $235- $245/mt FOB.\\nShipments in March are likely to total about 131,000 mt with\\nthe majority heading for Turkey, and April nominations are so far limited to one vessel for Nitora, also likely for Turkey:\\nUrea Black Sea line-up March 2015\\nTotal130,647\\n(1)cargo from TIS - DneproAzot\\nUrea Black Sea line-up April 2015\\nEUROPE\\nFRANCE\\nBuyers of granular urea hold off\\nProspects of possible further declines in granular urea values have served to sideline French distributors. While down on quotes last week at €330/mt FCA, offers for prompt and forward tonnage around an even €325/mt FCA in the French Bay are not eliciting significant acceptances.\\nApart from the overall decline in international values for granular urea, distributors cite the improvement close to 3.8% in the value of the euro against the US dollar in support of calls for offers below €320/mt FCA. The European currency traded marginally above $1.10 this week versus March 19 quotes closer to $1.06.\\nA €325/mt FCA quote at the current exchange rate reflects about $348/mt CIF, duty paid, suggesting Egyptian producer- netbacks marginally above $310/mt FOB after freight, costs and a small margin to an intermediary. A drop to €320/mt FCA would yield about $342/mt CIF and a correspondingly lower Egyptian return.\\nEgyptian urea menwhile traded at an even $300/mt FOB, albeit for a small lot for a nearby market.\\nTURKEY\\nVertiqal books prills with Turkish Group\\nThe Group of Importers in southern Turkey has booked 20,000 mt prilled urea with Vertiqal to load in April. Exact details on the pricing and payment terms were not released, but the deal was reportedly done at $283/mt CFR, inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nUREA | 6\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEGYPT\\nHFC books granular urea for Greece\\nReports from Cairo suggest that Helwan secured a sale this week of up to 7,000 mt granular urea for prompt loading from port inventory already cleared for export at a $300/mt FOB netback. The producer had previously denied reports of a $295/mt FOB sale.\\nThe purported new deal is indicative of a cost around $320/mt CFR to a main Greek port, duty paid. That number would equate to about $300/mt CFR, duty unpaid.\\nThis would imply netbacks below $280/mt FOB for dutiable product from the Black Sea, basis a similar lot. The return for dutiable Middle East origin would be around $265/mt FOB, based on shipment of a cargo of about 12-15,000 mt.\\nFurther to earlier reports, news on the expected Egyptian tender for the import of urea and AN to make up for the shortfall from domestic production due to continuing cuts in supply of natural gas had yet to emerge at press time.\\nThe perceived trend in paper markets is down. Offers for\\nApril positions from Egypt at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $310/mt FOB were countered with bids at $302/mt FOB. The bid- offer spread for May was $300/mt-$308/mt FOB and May was posted at $298-$308/mt FOB.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nOMAN\\nIRAN\\nIranian urea exports up further\\nExports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from Iran in February 2015 of 186,000 mt were up by 471% on February 2014. Brazil accounted for 77,000 mt while France and Belgium were registered with 33,000 mt each. Deliveries to India were 18,000 mt.\\nThe January-February export volume of 319,000 mt was up by 126.7% with Brazil accounting for 115,000 mt. Shipments to India of 56,000 mt were down by 34% on the prior year while deliveries to Iraq reached 54,000 mt.\\nNetbacks for granular slide further\\nMiddle East producers of granular urea are faced with increasing pressure on prices in all key markets, but a spot sale is nevertheless suggested at $268/mt FOB. A cargo for April loading was also booked on formula pricing from Oman, destined for Australia.\\nFirm offers in Brazil off inbound carriers have dipped into\\nthe low $280s/mt CFR, according to Brazilian importers. These imply netbacks to sellers no better than $260/mt FOB after deduction of freight, less provisions for costs and margins to intermediaries. Thai importers also cite offers below $290/mt CFR.\\nUS barge values for April that slipped to below $270/st FOB New Orleans equate to $287/mt CFR and were indicative of producer- netbacks around $265/mt FOB Middle East marker\\nalso offered limited comfort this week.\\nThe low end of Middle East granular values was thus\\nperceived below FOB values for FSU prills, an occurance recently only seen in Q4 2007 and subsequently in Q3 2014 when Black Sea prices were supported by limited output and pockets of regional demand.\\nAvailability of from Qafco has been reduced via the unplanned ammonia outages at Qafco III, V and VI, but the producer expects that all units will be operating regularly by the end of March or latest by April 4.\\nThe trend is significatly lower in paper markets. Offers for\\nApril Middle East positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps March 26 at $258/mt FOB were countered with bids at $255/mt FOB. The bid- offer spread for May was $250/mt-$256/mt FOB and May was posted at $248-$254/mt FOB.\\nUREA | 7\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nINDIA\\nApril 2014-February 2015 Indian imports up 13.2%\\nIndian April-February 2014-2015 imports of 7.84 million mt were up by 13.2% on the same period in 2013-2014 according to the latest provisional FAI trade data.\\nSales of urea totalled 28.4 million mt during April 2014-February 2015, down by 0.1% on the prior year. The February\\nvolume marginally above 2.7 million mt was however up on the 2.05 million mt delivered in February 2014, and followed an increase\\nin January 2015 to 3.12 million mt from the 3 million mt sold in January 2014.\\nDomestic production of urea was a shade short of 1.7 million mt\\nin February 2015, bringing the total close to 21 million mt in the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year. This was down by 0.7% on the 21.08 million mt produced April 2013-February 2014.\\nIndia: UREA SALES, PRODUCTION, IMPORTS – FEBRUARY 2015 (MT)\\nClosing stocks with states were at a mere 227,000 mt at the end of February, but that quantity does not include imported quantities in ports and urea en-route to Indian states. Illustrating the disparity, there were 12 vessels waiting to discharge urea in Indian ports March 19, carrying a total of 580,000 mt.\\nA significant portion of quantities procured via the 1.15 million mt purchases in the December 3 IPL tender had not reached individual Indian states at the time the data was collected, and multiple shipments of the 1.03 million mt booked via the January 27 MMTC tender are yet to arrive in Indian ports.\\nDoF instructions to STC still awaited\\nInstructions from the Department of Fertilizers (DoF) to STC on the additional tender for urea suggested imminent in recent weeks had yet to emerge at press time. As was the case last week, some observers still believe a tender could be announced in a day or two while others expect no news before the first days of April, mainly due to lack of immediate funding.\\nThe DoF is following developments in the international urea market closely, and appears to subscribe to the view that a delayed issuance of the tender will increase competition for the upcoming business, thus triggering lower offers from suppliers. Targets around a $270/mt CFR ECI level are widespread in the Delhi rumour-mill.\\nThe CFR India price posting has meanwhile been adjusted this week to reflect CIL\\'s recent purchase of 35,000 mt Chinese urea at $282/mt CFR.\\nNEPAL\\nAICL/Nepal to tender May 7\\nAICL has floated a tender for the purchase of 35,000 mt urea in 50 kilo bags, closing May 7 at 13:00hrs Kathmandu time. Offers with a validity of minimum 21 days from the closing date are requested for the urea to be delivered to AICL inland warehouses in Birgunj (17,500 mt), Bhairahawa (10,000 mt) and Biratnagar (7,500 mt). Delivery of 50% of the total quantity is requested within 97 days from the date of L/C issuance with the balance to be delivered within 20 days thereafter.\\nAICL awarded the February 23 tender for 35,000 mt bagged urea to Samsung at the trader\\'s offer at $376.60/mt CPT for the same delivery points.\\nThe tender May 7 also calls for offers for 20,000 mt bagged DAP.\\nPAKISTAN\\nECC clearance for TCP tender still awaited\\nAs was reported last week, Pakistan\\'s Fertilizer Review Committee (FRC) cleared a proposal to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to import up to 350,000 mt urea due to reduced output from indigenous units via curtailments in supply of natural gas.\\nThe FRC had initially identified the shortage at 380,000 mt, including buffers, but local reports continue to suggest that the final quantity will be 330-350,000 mt, subject to ECC approval.\\nAs in the case of India, a tender is unlikely to occur in March and clearance for one or more sessions for the total quantity may only emerge in the second week of April, if approved by the ECC.\\nUREA | 8\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nCHINA\\nChinese February urea exports exceed 1.29 million mt\\nAs was indicated in the March 23 Market Alert, exports of urea identified by Chinese customs via GTIS in the short month of February were 1.29 million mt. This brought the January-February exports to an all-time high of 2.97 million mt, up by 127.4% on the same two months in 2014.\\nThe 1.29 million mt February volume was up by 82.2% on February 2014. India accounted for 304,000 mt. Shipments to the Americas were up sharply with the US taking 233,000 mt and deliveries to Mexico of 133,000 mt. Ecuador and Chile were close to 95,000 each and shipments to Colombia reached 82,000 mt. Deliveries to Peru went from zero to 50,000 mt.\\nJanuary-February shipments to India of 1.18 million mt were up by 267% on the prior year and deliveries to the US of 413,000 mt were up by 48.4%. Shipments to Mexico of 144,000 mt were up by a full 601%. Deliveries to Pakistan registered a decline of 16.4% to 139,000 mt while shipments to Chile were up from zero to 119,000 mt. South Korea accounted for 105,000 mt, up by 154% on the prior year.\\nDomestic/export spread widens\\nThe domestic market for prilled urea moved up on demand for spring application, further lifting the spread between domestic netbacks and export returns. Mainstream quotes in Shandong were up to RMB 1,600/mt ($258/mt) EXW.\\nSales of prills were also concluded lower, down to RMB 1,500/mt ($241/mt) EXW in Shanxi, largely destined for export.\\nQuotes for prills into main ports such as Yantai were marginally below RMB 1,600/mt ($257/mt) CPT, indicative of an export value in the low $280s/mt FOB.\\nAs was the case last week, quotes for export from traders holding inventory are significantly lower, and the spread for the week is assessed at $268-273/mt FOB based on bids and offers in the market. Deals projecting significantly lower netbacks are considered to be short positions, and are therefore not taken into account when assessing the week\\'s range.\\nDomestic values for granular urea were stable around RMB1,560- 1,580/mt ($251-$254/mt) FCA in Shanxi, for an equivalent $298/mt FOB value, also substantially below actual export netbacks. Offers for granular urea from Chinese suppliers and bids from traders are used to assess the nominal export value at $278-283/mt FOB.\\nReturns on sales by traders believed to have taken short positions down to $270/mt FOB for granular have not been included as these are yet to elicit selling interest on the part of suppliers.\\nInventories in ports are assessed up on last week, with stocks of about 260,000 mt granular urea and 200,000 mt prills in Yantai alone. Qingdao stocks are assessed at a total of 150,000 mt. Total port inventory is estimated close to 900,000 mt.\\nPaper-markets largely matched the most bearish players in the physical market for prills. March 26 offers for April lots from China at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $258/mt FOB attracted bids no higher than $253/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $250-$255/mt FOB while June postings were at $245-$255/mt FOB.\\nSOUTH KOREA\\nLow price suggested in Namhae tender\\nThe March 20 Namhae tender for 6,000 mt granular urea was booked by a trader with Chinese material. The buyer did not reveal details on identity of the seller and the price concluded, but local reports suggest that a deal was struck in line with Dongbu\\'s March 16 tender purchase, marginally above $285/mt CFR.\\nUREA | 9\\nTHAILAND\\nThai importers cite lower quotes\\nAs in the case of Brazil, Thai importers indicate that offers for good quality granular are abundant below $295/mt CFR, and that Middle East quality product can be purchased below $290/mt CFR. Interest in additional cargos remains subdued.\\nOffers for Chinese granular are suggested even lower, in line with netbacks derived from recent regional trades reported around $288/mt CFR for small parcels.\\nWeekly Market Report\\n26 March 2015\\nLars Taarland , Editor - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7811 145370\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nCopyright notice:\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

High Chinese prices for prills, quoted well above $300/mt FOB for June would imply netbacks some $10/mt higher for Middle East producers, potentially reducing availability for the US and Brazil accordingly.\\nBullish sentiment on the spot market for prilled and granular urea did also prevail as participants in the 83rd annual IFA Conference gathered in Istanbul this week, but some more caution did emerge, even for the shorter term.\\nThe more bearish outlook for Black Sea urea was however dampened substantially via May 28 news that CherkassyAzot is one of the Group DF plants to close following the decision by DF to suspend production at all Ukrainian units. While the Cherkassy urea output has been limited to less than 50,000 mt/month lately, the decision will likely have a significant psychological impact on the short term regional urea market.\\nSurging values for granular urea in the US came to a halt as the IFA Conference was ending, with bargeloads changing hands up to $30/st off recent peaks. The driver at New Orleans is flooding in the Arkansas River markets that will make some June arrivals competitive while barge traffic waits to move north and west again. Furthermore, the timing of the delay means the inevitable end to the seasonal bull market for barges probably has moved to the start of June, rather than the end of the month. On the other hand, the sudden shortage in the largest urea consuming market in the US has added $5-20/st to truck prices in the Southern Plains this week.\\nEuropean distributors were meanwhile struggling to keep up with immediate demand, and spot trades in inland positions in Italy moved up sharply on pockets of demand that needed to be covered.\\nForward prices in Europe are nevertheless in line with numbers posted in recent weeks, and buyers maintain a relaxed attitude on availability and showed no intentions of stocking up at prevailing prices.\\nSimilar sentiment was also evident in Brazil where buyers continue to reject quotes based on prior sales by Middle East producers above $310/mt FOB. Indications of possible interest reflect returns some $10-15/mt\\nlower, but potential sales by Middle East producers in Pakistan might alter the approach by the Brazilian importers.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Group DF suspends urea output from Cherkassy Azot\\n∙US granular may be coming off their seasonal peak\\n∙Producers and traders prepare for TCP tenders in Pakistan\\n∙STC likely to float Indian urea tender early June\\n∙Netbacks in Egypt inch higher\\n∙Brazilian importers still reject high offers\\n∙Chinese suppliers maintain hard line on exports\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed. Many signs point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but uncertainty over the duration of the cutbacks in Chinese export volumes and the suspension of Group DF exports attract sufficient attention to conceivably support prices well into June.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Too wet for field work, prices unchanged\\nPrices were unchanged but relatively little field work has occurred this week due to wet weather over the prior couple of weeks. Quotes for granular urea remain at $370-375/st FOB Midwest from river terminals and inland warehouses. Demand may benefit in coming weeks as some farmers give more consideration to urea and UAN instead of ammonia due to ground conditions.\\nUS NOLA: Market turns midweek, floods block barges\\nAfter holding its ground around $355/st FOB New Orleans, granular urea barges lost almost $30/st late May 27 and May 28 as barge movement up the Arkansas River was substantially blocked by high water from flooding in Texas and Oklahoma.\\nBusiness was concluded around $355/st FOB early in the week. However, offers at $345/st FOB, $340/st FOB, $338/st FOB and $337/st FOB were reported and business was confirmed as low as $325/st FOB for prompt barges in the US Gulf. While floods are pulling back in the US interior, the delay moving up the\\nArkansas River means barges discharging in coming days can now compete for enduser business previously limited to barges already loaded in the Gulf.\\nUS S Plains: Flooding boosts warehouse values\\nDeadly flooding in Texas and Oklahoma is extending the halt to field work that wiped out most regional activity last week. At press time there was no word from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) over when or where the agency might close traffic on the Arkansas River due to high and fast moving water.\\nHowever, barge carriers were not adding tows to the river\\'s lineup. This in turn enabled warehouse sellers to boost demands for spot trucks to $370-390/st FOB throughout the region. Some distributors are scrambling to meet commitments tied to barges unable to move up the Arkansas River.\\nAt press time, local media in Oklahoma and Arkansas reported water was falling from levels up to 10 feet above flood stage at some river ports and terminals.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyers still reject high quotes for granular urea\\nBrazilian buyers are maintaining that prospects for a softer forward market for granular urea are such that purchases of forward positions as offered in the $330s/mt CFR are not viable. Indications of buying interest circulating in Istanbul were in the upper $310s/mt CFR, and buyers were in no rush to conclude.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: EuroChem books Salavat granular urea\\nEuroChem booked a total of 26,000 mt granular urea to load end June/early July in the May 27 Salavat tender originally floated for the sale of 20,000 mt to load early July. The exact price in the transaction was not released, but local reports suggest that the deal was struck around $315/mt FOB.\\nPrills are on offer at $288-293/mt FOB depending on quantity, loadport and time of loading, but buying interest remains subdued. Traders are thus far unwilling to assume forward length and netbacks on open business in Latin America are below the $285/mt FOB marker.\\nBlack Sea: Prices stable week on week\\nThe IFA conference in Istanbul did not serve as a platform for further substantial increases in Black Sea prices for prills, but news of Group DF suspension of output from its Ukrainian plants could trigger additional price increases. The suspension includes urea from Cherkassy Azot.\\nLimited trades in Turkey were indicative of netbacks around the $285/mt FOB marker. Quotes from producers are no lower than $292-294/mt FOB, but widespread reports of sales by OPZ at $290-291/mt FOB\\nfor June loading could not be confirmed. The suggested deals have therefore not be included in the range posted for the week.\\nWhile the duration of the closure of urea output from Cherkassy remains uncertain, the loss of close\\nto 50,000 mt urea per month from the Black Sea will be significant for nearby markets such as Turkey and Italy where NF Trading has been feeding its distribution network.\\nShipments in May from Yuzhnyy/TIS appear set to pan out a little short of 150,000 mt, including about 30,000 mt for Egypt and 30,000 mt for Mexico, destinations that have not been featuring notably from Yuzhnyy since quite some time.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: OCI suggested as buyer of MOPCO parcel\\nOCI is now suggested as the buyer of the 3,000 mt granular urea sold by MOPCO pursuant to the May 21 tender at $320/mt FOB for prompt lifting.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: STC in line for new tender in June\\nIndian importer STC is expected to float a new tender for urea to complement the relatively limited 775,000 mt procured by IPL via the May 9 session. The new tender for an unspecified quantity of urea is expected out in the first week of June, and will likely permit shipment through Agust 15-20.\\nThe Department of Fertilizers will be keenly watching offers in the TCP tenders in Pakistan closing May 29 and June 1 for guidance on pricing in the region.\\nSri Lanka: MoA to tender for urea June 9\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is to tender on June 9 for 36,000 mt granular urea plus 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea.\\nThe full quantity is to be available for distribution in bags in Colombo in August, implying shipment by the end of July/early August if loaded from China and the Middle East. The tender will provide an indication of traders\\' and producers\\' perceptions of the forward market for both urea grades.\\nPakistan: ECC clears additional imports\\nPakistan\\'s Economic Co-ordination Committee (ECC) has finally cleared the import of a further 150,000t of urea for Kharif application. The ECC clearance has been pending since the Fertilizer Review Committee recommended the additional imports in early April.\\nThe tenders will follow the two sessions by Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) set to close May 29 and June 1 for 50,000 mt each. The 150,000 mt requirement is expected to be split into three separate TCP tenders for 50,000 mt each, likely to close late June, allowing for shipment by July 20-25.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Dongbu, Namhae testing regional prices\\nDongbu is reported to have taken an additional 4-5,000 mt granular urea from China marginally below $325/mt CFR, suggesting a netback to the seller around $305/mt FOB from China.\\nAmeropa was widely associated with the deal. Namhae was in discussions with suppliers in Istanbul for a parcel of about 6,000 mt granular urea for late June delivery, but a deal had yet to be confirmed at press time.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim V production improving\\nWhile production of ammonia at the facility is up to about 75% of rated capacity, output of granular urea from Kaltim V is currently running at about 45% of the unit\\'s rated 3,500 mt/day capacity due to technical issues. The producer has not indicated a date for completion of the repairs currently being made to the plant.\\nThailand: Buyers yet to concede higher granular prices\\nImporters in Thailand are yet to give in to demands from sellers for prices above $330/mt CFR and cite renewed approaches from traders offering Iranian granular urea.\\nWhile up on last week\\'s $305/mt CFR deal, offers at $310-312/mt CFR for Iranian material are suggested in support of calls for lower offers from traditional sources. Contract cargoes priced via formulae are suggested arriving around an even $320/mt CFR, but suppliers are pushing hard for better returns.\\nChina: Urea values up, domestic may be near peak\\nDomestic values for prilled and granular urea in China firmed further this week as local distributors continued purchasing in preparation for the peak application season for corn. Prills for prompt export were again sold close to $300/mt FOB to traders short for India at netbacks some $12-14/mt lower, with offers for June closer to $305/mt FOB.\\nOffers for granular urea for export are maintained well above $310/mt for regular Chinese quality, and above $320/mt FOB for premium product.\\nOffers at high prices did however slow activity somewhat as acceptance of the higher numbers at retail level is yet to be fully tested. Estimates on availability versus demand differ substantially, and a more cautious approach has been noted.\\nMainstream domestic trades in prills at RMB 1,680-1,700/mt ($271-274/mt) EXW in northern China were up by RMB 30-50/mt ($5-8/mt) on last week. Similar increases were also recorded in Shanxi where product traded at RMB 1,620-1,650/mt ($261-266/mt) FCA.\\nDomestic buyers are competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,730/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $304/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.\\nDomestic values for granular urea for export were up to RMB 1,780/mt CPT northern ports, indicative of an export price at $312/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. Offers circulating May 28 were above RMB 1,800/mt CPT.\\nInventories in ports for export are down on last week. Yantai inventory is assessed at 220,000 mt this week compared to 300,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 130,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have slowed to about 10,000 mt/day.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim fails to achieve target-price\\nThe May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim to load by June 15 that had been restricted to a limited number of participants attracted one bid only, at $305/mt FOB Bontang.\\nThe producer had been targeting netbacks in excess of the $311-311.50/mt FOB concluded with Fertcomm and Ameropa for 30,000 mt each in prior sessions, and is currently in discussions with traders, attempting to secure an improvement in pricing for the cargo still available. A further cargo of around 30,000 mt is also being discussed for later loading.\\nChina: April urea exports close to 850,000 mt\\nApril exports of urea from China were limited to about 850,000 mt, down sharply on the 1.31 million mt exported in April 2014.\\nThe drop in volume reflects the firmer stance against low prices adopted by the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association that triggered rejections of bids from traders at levels below returns available in the domestic market.\\nThe April volume did nevertheless lift January-April exports to about 5.28 million mt, still some\\n61% ahead of the 3.27 million mt exported in the first four months of 2014. May 2015 exports are also predicted relatively low, likely in line with the 545,000 mt exported in May 2014.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs. Smaller forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA.\\nLittle other UAN is reported available with Abu Qir yet to issue another export tender. GrodnoAzot also reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32.\\nDespite the CF export business to France and Argentina, US UAN values have not firmed and inland distributors report US producers are responding rapidly to prompt demand for more UAN.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nDemand from Brazil remains one of the few AS market drivers with supplier offers still reported at $160- 170/mt CFR. Recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being though. Caprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160- 170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.\\nTCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR providing netbacks around $130/mt FOB.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nThe May 26 Yara annnouncement of a €50/mt drop in the price for CAN for new season deliveries in Germany to €225/mt CIF highlighted an otherwise slow week in trading in solid nitrates. While so far not announced by Yara, the price for Germany will also apply for deliveries in Benelux.\\nExports of AN from the FSU remain limited, but a slight uptick in netbacks was evident over the week despite the concerns on financing in Brazil as highlighted in the above.\\nImporters in Turkey cite offers for AN at attractive forward prices, and may opt to purchase early rather than wait for the traditional summer lull basis prices indicated by sellers that reflect netbacks to FSU producers substantially below current numbers.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Market mostly watching with CF exports\\nDomestic barge trades were thin this week for UAN-32, leaving most of the market to focus on recent CF Industries\\' export commitments of around 130,000 mt. Traders report that 100,000 mt is committed to France, while the 30,000 mt balance is covering a sale to Argentina. Indications based on enduser values in those markets suggest a net to the producer of about $180/mt FOB US Gulf or roughly the equivalent of $160/st FOB in a barge, allowing for loading costs.\\nWhile this is far less than recent spot domestic business around $240/st FOB New Orleans, CF is expected to increasingly participate in the export market to balance its supply against increasing output from other US inland producers, including the OCI plant under construction in Iowa.\\nUS Midwest: UAN demand steady but application delay\\nThe US Midwest region has been wet throughout much of May, but has not suffered through the flooding reported in many states to the south. However, overall movement of all products is down as much as 40% in some areas compared to historical averages for the month. However, none of this is worrisome to distributors as they fully expect to make up sales during June. Even though little UAN has been used in the region, distributors report retailers are ordering more than expected in many areas.\\nUAN pricing in the remains at $9.22-9.63/unit FOB. UAN demand is benefitting from the recent wet weather, as much of the corn ground remains too soggy for ammonia application equipment. In addition, corn growth has been more rapid than in prior years. This week\\'s US Department of Agriculture survey found 74% of the expected corn crop had emerged nationwide, compared to the five-year average of 62%. As the corn gets taller, ammonia application becomes less attractive and anecdotal evidence suggests farmers and retailers are buying more UAN and urea to ensure proper nitrogen applications in coming weeks for corn in the region.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic: GrodnoAzot scraps latest UAN-32 export tender\\nGrodnoAzot reportedly scrapped its May 22 tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32. This follows the scrapping of its May 11 session for the same volume.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: CF sells up to 100,000 mt UAN to Invivo\\nCF Industries has sold as much as 100,000 mt UAN-32 into Rouen to Invivo with the first 35,000 mt shipment already fixed. The business was reported concluded at about $180/mt FOB US Gulf ($160/st FOB barge New Orleans equivalent). Given freight estimates of around $35/mt and current euro/dollar exchange rates this would translate to about €194/mt FCA for UAN-30 loading from tanks in France, plus provisions for margins and carrying costs.\\nSmall forward sales of UAN-30 into France have been concluded at €192/mt FCA with some sellers still holding back from concluding business in anticipation of selling at even higher prices in the coming month.\\nNetherlands: Prompt UAN business continues\\nPrompt sales of UAN continue to be made into the Netherlands with prices reported at an even €215/mt FCA.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Next Abu Qir UAN-32 tender likely for June\\nAbu Qir has not yet issued another export tender. The supplier is thought to be waiting until sufficient tonnes are accumulated and for export licenses covering the month of June.\\nAS\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: AS business slow due to credit difficulties\\nBrazilian demand for AS is steadily increasing although recent further declines in corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases for the time being.\\nLatest production estimates for the country\\'s corn crop continue to rise due to favourable weather, adding further to corn inventories and lower prices. With the cost of inputs continuing to rise and domestic corn prices hitting six months lows (according to the IGC), the next season\\'s planted area is likely to decline possibly impacting future AS consumption. Concerns over Brazilian farmers\\' access to credit at preferential interest-rates was also a common theme at the annual IFA conference held in Istanbul this week.\\nCaprolactam grade product offers are reported at $160-170/mt CFR while granular AS is nearer $220-230/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: TCCC may issue another AS tender soon\\nTCCC will likely soon issue another AS import tender for 6,000 mt. Current prices for Chinese caprolactam grade product for Thailand are pegged at $150/mt CFR.\\nAN\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Marketers indicate forward availability of AN\\nMarketers of ammonium nitrate have been approaching Turkish importers this week with indications of availablility as far forward as November and December at prices around $230/mt CFR with 180 days credit, duty paid.\\nBuyers have been counter-indicating some $15/mt lower, but purchasing interest in the positions is evident. The $222.50/mt CFR average of the bids and offers would suggest a $209/mt CFR value for dutiable Russian or Ukranian tonnage, inclusive of credit, for a 205/mt CFR cash equivalent or about $185-190/mt FOB from the Black Sea, depending on cargo size and discharge port.\\nCAN\\nEUROPE\\nGermany: Yara posts new season CAN price\\nYara notified its clients May 26 that the price for CAN in Germany effective June 1 onwards has been fixed at €225/mt CIF inland ports. The posting was down by €50/mt on the previous season price posted at €275/mt CIF, and was also down by €3/mt on the €228/mt CIF price published June 10, 2014, applicable for deliveries from mid-July 2014.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The general consensus is that a rollover at $450/mt CFR would reflect expected limited price movements west of Suez, while others suggest a further decline of $15/mt is not out of the question.\\nThose few forecasting an increase in the July Tampa figure attribute their belief to continued strong US demand in an otherwise weak market. US Gulf arrivals are bolstered by Koch\\'s line-up after it recently secured just over 100,000 mt from the Black Sea and Baltic priced at around $390/mt FOB, with most tonnes destined for its domestic supply chain. There are indications that Koch is negotiating further purchases from the Baltic, Black Sea and possibly Algeria for July lifting amid reports of production issues at its US facilities.\\nUS phosphate producers Mosaic and PotashCorp are expected to run plants at normal rates, keeping ammonia demand for MAP and DAP production steady over the summer.\\nUS inland demand for ammonia may have taken a slight hit in recent weeks though, as wet weather prevented ammonia applications in most of May. It remains to be seen if US suppliers can catch up in June, or if some farmers will turn to urea/UAN instead of ammonia for supplemental applications for corn acres.\\nEast of Suez sentiment points to continued weakness on ample supply. CJ Indonesia’s tender award to Yara May 26 at $437/mt CFR evidenced little change in pricing, while Koch was able to pick up 16,000 mt from Petronas under a formula pricing arrangement to meet contract commitments in South Korea.\\nOutput at Qafco’s ammonia units continues to run well with all product used against contract commitments. Additional ammonia needs are being met by securing product from Sabic and Ameropa over the next month.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Ameropa sells 20,000 mt to Koch ex-Yuzhnny around $390/mt FOB\\n∙Koch picks up 15,000 mt from Ameropa ex-Sillamae at $390/mt FOB\\n∙Optimism that Tunisian ammonium demand will soon recover\\n∙OCP reports full ammonia tanks; seeking below $400/mt CFR for June\\n∙Muntajat to secure additional cargoes from Ameropa and Sabic\\n∙Koch buys 16,000 mt Petronas cargo against SFC commitments\\n∙Namhae seeking July/August additional cargo\\nShort term outlook:\\nSoftness will prevail in the ammonia market with pricing east and west of Suez expected to move little.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nOCP is maintaining granulation rates in June at similar levels to May and as such ammonia demand should be relatively steady particulalry as more focus is being given to MAP. In Tunisia and Jordan however, demand will remain curtailed although following the news that rock production has been resumed at one mine, GCT is expected to give priority to DAP production at Gabes and this will prompt renewed ammonia requirements.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices were stable at last week\\'s level of $1,750-1800/mt CFR China following several weeks of increases to their highest levels since early January.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: Imports needed to restock inland supply chain\\nUS ammonia imports appear likely to step up in June and July, mostly through Koch, as US suppliers take in imported material to help replenish consumption from the direct application market this spring. Speculation about July pricing at Tampa already is underway, with many market watchers betting on a flat $450/mt CFR or even lower price tag. Bullish views are less common.\\nUS Midwest: Side-dress ammonia waits for dry ground\\nWhile there are no floods underway in the US Midwest, the ground has been wet for much of the month of May, and farmers have been careful to focus on planting corn during those days suitable for field work. This has left fewer days available for finishing preplant or starting side-dress ammonia applications, according to distributors. There are anecdotal reports of higher sales of urea and UAN in recent weeks compared to seasonal norms. Price is not a factor at this stage, as ammonia remains the cheapest form of nitrogen at $605-625/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras to market ammonia cargos in H2 2015\\nPetrobras indicated it will have two ammonia spot cargoes available for lifting in H2 2015. The first will likely be marketed in August with the second available towards the end of the year.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Koch may repeat recent Baltic purchase\\nAmeropa has sold a 15,000 mt parcel to Koch reportedly around $390/mt FOB. The cargo will be loaded on the Clipper Neptune early June in Sillamae and will then pick up 25,000 mt from Uralchem in Ventspils.\\nUralchem is in negotiations as regards spot tonnage for July lifting, possibly with Koch again.\\nThe supplier will have scarce tonnes to market in August and September as its ammonia facility undergoes a maintenance shutdown.\\nBlack Sea: Koch secures more tonnes for Clipper Orion\\nKoch secured the remaining 20,000 mt it needed to complete a full 40,000 mt for loading on the Clipper Orion May 28. Its latest purchase from Ameropa is reported concluded within the current Black Sea range at $380-390/mt FOB.\\nThis follows Ameropa\\'s sale to Koch last week on the Gas Grouper for the US. Koch has chartered the vessel from Ameropa for the coming month and will likely use the vessel to shuttle between Trinidad and the US.\\nAmeropa is also in spot discussions with Qafco’s marketing arm Muntajat for the sale of 23,000 mt on a CFR basis, likely to be delivered to Jordan at the end of June.\\nOPZ is currently in negotiations for the sale of another 20,000 mt in June, possibly to Koch again.\\nDespite repeated rumours of a maintenance shutdown at Group DF\\'s Russian plant scheduled for June, firm details on the timetable of such a turnaround were not disclosed at press time.\\nGroup DF\\'s suspension of nitrogen production at its Ukrainian facilities CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot announced May 28 are unlikely to have a material effect on ammonia. The majority of ammonia produced at the units is used to produce urea and ammonium nitrate with only small volumes available for merchant use.\\nGroup DF\\'s other Ukrainian nitrogen units Gorlovka and Severodonetsk in Eastern Ukraine have been shut since May 2014 due to political unrest in the region.\\nNF Trading has around 23,000 mt spot tonnage available for June lifting:\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nQatar: Muntajat to secure additional ammonia cargoes\\nQafco’s ammonia units are running well with product fully committed for June and July with contract customers.\\nQafco’s marketing arm Muntajat said it also plans to secure a 23,000 mt cargo from Sabic and a similar sized parcel from Ameropa out of the Black Sea in the next month to be used against contract business, likely in Jordan and South Africa.\\nJordan: Subdued ammonia demand likely in near term\\nJordanian ammonia demand is likely to remain subdued in the near term as JPMC indicated it will be producing around 450,000 mt DAP this year, down from close to 650,000 mt in 2014. Increased emphasis will be given to phosphoric acid this year including shipments into Indonesia, India and Turkey.\\nTunisia: Increased optimism for the fertilizer industry\\nThere was increased optimism among market participants at the IFA Istanbul conference this week that Tunisian fertilizer production will soon get back on track.\\nCPG has re-started phosphate rock production at its Kef Eddour mine after a three-week total stoppage and months of strikes, sit-ins and general disruption.\\nAmmonia demand is not expected to increase substantially for another few weeks at least, although one 23,000 mt cargo ex-Black Sea will be arriving in Gabes early June owing to on-going AN production in Tunisia.\\nMorocco: Buyer seeks even lower values for June\\nOCP is reported targeting numbers substantially below $400/mt CFR for June ammonia deliveries.\\nAt present the buyer reports its tanks are full following a number of recent deliveries from Yuzhnny and Algeria and is in no hurry to buy additional cargo.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: No uptick in demand expected in coming months\\nIndian ammonia demand is reported stable and likely to remain so over the coming months. Despite recent arrivals of phosphoric acid into the country, supplies are still relatively limited and not substantial enough to stimulate additional ammonia demand.\\nDeepak Fertilisers will take delivery of a 7,500 mt contract cargo of ammonia ex-Iran mid June to be priced via formula. The buyer’s next spot requirement is likely to be in mid July.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Namhae seeking yet more spot cargo\\nNamhae said is in discussions for an additional 15,000 mt parcel for July/August delivery with a number of trader offers received. Namhae’s previous spot purchase was secured at $433/mt CFR from Yara several weeks ago.\\nAmmonia demand remains weak with suggestions that SFC’s affiliate Tong Suh Petrochemical Corp may reduce its acrylonitrile production rates further.\\nTaiwan: CPDC likely to buy another Iran cargo\\nCPDC will target another cargo outside contract commitments for July delivery, likely from Iran. The buyer has secured two spot cargoes from Raintrade since the start of this year and is looking to increase trade further.\\nContract prices continue to hover around $450/mt CFR but due to continued weak ammonia demand from downstream caprolactam and acrylonitrile buyers, downward price pressure is set to be maintained.\\nMalaysia: Koch buys from Petronas\\nKoch has bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for lifting on the Bunga Kemobja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.\\nIndonesia: Yara awarded CJ tender\\nCJ Indonesia has awarded its May 25 6,000 mt ammonia import tender to Yara at $437/mt CFR.\\nKaltim V is reported running ammonia at 75% capacity and urea at 45% after technical issues earlier this month.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

This truly cements PhosAgro\\'s return to the Indian market after a three year absence.\\nHaving already supplied a sizeable volume of DAP and NPKs to India through March and April, further quantities will continue to be shipped through the year. This will provide PhosAgro with a useful alternative to Africa for its NPKs, where it faces increasing competition from Morocco, while also reducing its dependence on the Americas for DAP/MAP.\\nThe Turkish market has sprung into action this week with up to 180,000 mt DAP, or almost 50% of its annual requirement, already booked. The uncertainties arising from the situation in Tunisia have prompted buyers to look at all manner of sources as well as alternative products. Tonnes from Jordan, Lithuania, Morocco and Egypt have been booked along with 18,000 mt from Tunisian stocks. In addition a substantial quantity of 20- 20-0 was also booked this week, no doubt to provide a cheaper alternative to DAP following the depreciation of the currency in recent months. Additional spot opportunities will depend on if and how quickly GCT can resume DAP production at Gabes.\\nThis was another significant development to occur this week. On Tuesday, employees at CPG\\'s headquarters in Tunisia returned to work while production at one of CPG\\'s rock mines was resumed. The situation had become critical with the whole industry paralysed from the mine to the transport system, all of the downstream facilities and on up to the management level. Those markets watching developments in Tunisia most closely will be Turkey and southern Europe where GCT would normally have been targeting June/Q3 tonnes. The issues in Gafsa are so deeply entrenched, as Fertilizer Week has been reporting on a regular basis, that production rates are not expected to return to \"normal\" levels overnight. But it is a major step forward and marks a reversal of the critical spiral that has brought the industry to its knees over the past month.\\nWith DAP production likely to be the priority for GCT in the near term, availability of TSP is expected to become tight. This week also saw the attacks in Syria threatening the phosphate rock mines near Palmyra. Syrian rock is used by Lebanon Chemicals for TSP production and LCC will be targeting next week\\'s tender in Bangladesh for the private sector TSP requirement. With Chinese TSP banned and nothing coming out of Tunisia, without LCC supply sources for this tender could be limited.\\nThe Brazilian market remains steady with no sign yet of any surge in demand sufficient to drive prices up any further. The most significant development this week was the announcement that OCP had sold 70,000 mt MAP into Brazil for June at a rollover price of $500/mt CFR. As indicated in Fertilizer Week\\'s report pre-IFA, a certain resistance seemed to have crept into the market with the $500/mt CFR level marking a\\nceiling. However suppliers have now started to indicate $510/mt CFR and with timing now becoming more\\ncrucial in the face of potential congestion at the ports, suppliers are hoping that importers may be forced to concede an increase in price.\\nChinese suppliers meanwhile remain united on price in India despite considerable downward pressure from buyers looking for a reduction of between $5-15/mt on imported DAP. Chinese producers, having already shipped 2 million mt DAP/MAP through January-April, appear, at least for the near term, to be comfortable going into June. However June, July and H1 August mark the peak export season for China, with no pull from the domestic market until mid August. As such, any further wobbles in the rupee against the USD or any new evidence that the monsoon will indeed be below normal, will almost certainly lead to a correction in the DAP price. Chinese MAP (10-50-0 and 11-44-0) prices on the other hand look firm through the next six weeks, supported by steady import demand from Brazil.\\n∙PhosAgro agrees 3-year deal in India for 1.35 million mt DAP/NPK/NPS\\n∙Turkish buyers return to the market\\n∙OCP sells 70,000 mt MAP for $500/mt CFR Brazil\\n∙Chinese DAP suppliers remain united on price in India amidst continued pressure\\n∙80,000 mt Moroccan MAP/DAP to load in July for the US\\n∙Jordanian DAP production to remain below capacity in 2015\\n∙Rock production resumed in Tunisia\\n∙ISIS threatens phosphate rock mining region in Syria\\n∙Increase confirmed for Jordanian rock prices\\n∙OCP continues to indicate early Q3 for commercial production of JPH-1 and the next three units to start up at six monthly intervals thereafter\\nSulphur\\nSulphur markets were stable to slightly higher this week. Tasweeq moved its QSP up $2/mt to $141/mt FOB, roughly in line with expectations but remaining conservative, as spot business from the Middle East was reported in the mid-$140s/mt FOB and the seller\\'s recent tender went at the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB. With the price announced and IFA discussion out of the way, activity is expected to pick up over the coming week.\\nAmmonia\\n∙No major price movements on ammonia this week but the market remains soft both east and west of Suez.\\nShort Term Outlook\\nBrazilian farm economics and weather factors in India will determine the health of the phosphate market through Q3. Any further drop in crop prices and/or hike in interest rates will almost certainly impact farmers\\' buying power in Brazil. Otherwise demand should be relatively strong with some even expecting a spike in price prompted by condensed demand for imports in a comparatively small window. In India, over 4 million mt DAP have now been secured in the form of spot sales, MoUs and shipments to Mosaic\\'s own system for the year. Further spot demand will therefore depend on weather factors.\\nNever before has currency volatility played such an important part in the phosphate market as it has over the past year with the weaker Indian rupee, euro and Turkish lira reducing buying power while the collapse in the Rouble has pushed Russian producers to the bottom of the cost curve. Even the weaker Brazilian real, which\\nalthough ultimately is good for the exporting farmer, has caused problems arising from the sheer volatility and subsequent uncertainty. Currency movements will continue to influence price going forward.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barge market creeps higher on thin trade\\nDAP barges changed hands this week at $420-427/st FOB, according to suppliers. Spot MAP quotes are $5- 10/st above DAP levels. But it appears the somewhat broad price spread occurred on relatively thin trading. Phosphate demand mostly has been met along the Arkansas River, and barges are unlikely to be able to move up that waterway at any substantial rate in coming days due to flooding. In northern markets, demand for phosphates will likely require further spot barge purchases to cover the remaining demand from soybean and hay crops.\\nMeanwhile, OCP/Morocco said it has committed an 80,000 mt DAP/MAP cargo to load for the US Gulf during July. The material is destined for Koch and PotashCorp.\\nUS Tampa: Export market quiet after IFA\\nMosaic has not reported any export trade this week. Many of the players in the international phosphates market participated in this week\\'s IFA meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. However, no substantial changes in US export expectations emerged.\\nAny new spot business, if in Brazil, could move the Tampa price up more in line with recent deals concluded by OCP. A $500/mt CFR Brazil would give a netback closer to the low-mid $480s/mt FOB Tampa, a $10/mt increase on current price indications out of the Gulf.\\nUS Midwest: DAP demand met, some carryover stocks\\nDAP demand for corn and soybean acres in the Midwest has been met, with most phosphate applied for those crops, even though soybean planting progress is trailing expectations in Iowa, Kansas and Missouri, according to the May 26 US Crop Progress report. Distributors on both sides of the Mississippi River report they are ending the season with some carryover DAP and MAP, but they are not concerned that phosphate values will move substantially up or down before the fall season. Quotes for DAP remain around $460/st FOB, while MAP is available for as little as a $5/st premium.\\nThere will be some further demand for phosphates for hay and alfalfa. Wet weather has delayed the first cuttings for those crops in many places, which in turn delays further fertilizer applications for subsequent harvesting.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: Import interest should emerge for June\\nImporters are expected to start showing an interest in June cargoes. Price indications for MAP 11-52-0 for June shipment are between $505-515/mt CFR with Russian and Saudi tonnes within this range. Chinese 11- 52-0 remains elusive as none of the Chinese producers are producing it, still preferring to supply DAP and granular 10-5-0. Unlike Brazil, Chinese 11-44-0 is not generally sold into Argentina as it attracts a 6% duty (on NPs).\\nBrazil: Rollover price for OCP June MAP sales\\nOCP has sold 70,000 mt MAP and 30,000 mt TSP into Brazil for June shipment. The price for the MAP was unchanged from the last round of May sales at $500/mt CFR. The TSP was priced at $400/mt CFR, an increase of around $15/mt since the last reported sales out of Morocco into Brazil.\\nOCP has allocated a further 100,000 mt also for June shipment which is yet to be sold and for which it is targeting a price of $510/mt CFR.\\nPhosAgro is also targeting $510/mt CFR for MAP/DAP for June shipment.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: PhosAgro agrees 1.35 million NPK/DAP to India\\nPhosAgro agreed a three-year supply deal with IPL for 1.35 million mt fertilizers, mainly NPKs 10-26-26 and 15-15-15, but also including DAP and NPS.\\nThis suggests total shipments per year of 400-450,000 mt for India. PhosAgro has already shipped a considerable quantity to India through March/April totalling an estimated 300-340,000 mt DAP plus NPKs to IPL/IFFCO. It has not yet been confirmed whether any of these cargoes are included in the current contract.\\nAt today\\'s prices and freights, Indian netbacks on Russian DAP are in the low/mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic, significantly lower than potential netbacks from Brazil at current price levels of $500/mt CFR. Brazilian landed prices would give a netback above $470/mt FOB Baltic including trader margin. PhosAgro has this week raised its price indication for Brazil for June to $510/mt CFR.\\nThe company is indiacting a sizeable domestic delivery schedule through Q3 this year, much later than normal and due to the dismal volume sold into the local market through Q1. As much as 500,000 mt MAP/NPKs are targeted for sale into the Russian market from June through September.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Surge in buying activity before and during IFA\\nDetails of a number of deals emerged at this week’s IFA conference in Istanbul totalling 150,000 mt NP 20-\\n20-0 and between 135-185,000 mt DAP as follows:\\nToros – 50-100,000 mt DAP including some NPKs from OCP/Morocco for June-September shipment.\\nIgsas – 30,000 mt DAP from EuroChem/Lithuania at $505/mt CFR duty free with 180 days credit for end May shipment.\\nVarious southern Turkish distributers – 30,000 mt DAP from Ameropa/JPMC/Jordan at $507/mt CFR Iskenderun duty free with 270 days credit for June shipment.\\nGubretas – 18,000 mt DAP from GCT /Tunisia for May shipment – out of stocks and as part of eventual supply contract yet to be announced.\\nGemlik – 150,000 mt 20-20-0 from China (direct sale) at $295/mt FOB, equating to an estimated $320- 325/mt CFR.\\nSouthern buyers - 5,000 mt Egyptian DAP from Aries at around $510/mt CFR with credit for prompt shipment.\\nScope for further spot DAP business will depend on how successful the Tunisian government’s current attempt is to re-start DAP production at Gabes. If GCT is able to produce in the coming weeks and supply against its expected contract, demand for spot tonnes will reduce accordingly. Given a return to production, GCT could supply in the region of 150,000 mt from June onwards but any shortfall will be picked up through imports.\\nTurkey is generally expected to require around 400,000 mt imported DAP per year with the eventual quantity dependent on prevailing prices and buyers’ buying power. Some quantities are also imported, mainly from Jordan, for delivery over the border into northern Iraq however a substantial rise in delivery costs since the beginning of this year due to the far greater security risks could reduce demand for this region.\\nIn addition, the 30% depreciation of the lira over the past year or so will have an impact on eventual demand for the Turkish market and as such overall quantities are expected be down. This is one of the reasons undoubtedly supporting Gemlik’s decision to import the large quantity of 20-20-0, as a cheaper alternative to DAP.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nJordan: Limited spot availability for June onwards\\nAmeropa sold a 30,000 mt DAP cargo from JPMC into southern Turkey for June shipment at $507/mt CFR Iskenderun with 270 days credit giving an estimated netback of just above or at $480/mt FOB Aqaba.\\nJPMC will be producing 420-450,000 mt DAP this year, down from close to 650,000 mt in 2014. Increased emphasis will be given to phosphoric acid including shipments into Indonesia, India and Turkey.\\nDespite the drop in DAP production, JPMC will continue to supply the 300,000 mt against its contract with IPL through to March next year and will most probably direct any balance into Turkey and other Med markets. With 30,000 mt already sold into Turkey plus tonnes into Bulgaria, further availability for the rest of the year will be limited.\\nThe Aqaba plant will return to full granulation production by the beginning of next year and by mid 2016, JPMC is aiming to reach the planned 1 million mt DAP target following prolonged debottlenecking work. Production of MAP and NPKs at the Aqaba complex is also planned.\\nMorocco: June MAP/DAP price unchanged on May\\nOCP sold 180,000 mt MAP, DAP and TSP to Brazil and Europe for June and has allocated a further 100,000 mt for the Brazilian market, also for June. The price achieved on the Brazilian MAP sales was $500/mt CFR, unchanged from the last round of tonnes sold for May shipment.\\nOCP has also announced an agreement to supply 50-100,000 mt DAP and some NPKs to Toros/Turkey for June-September shipment. Price details have not yet been disclosed.\\nOCP’s line up for June includes the following:\\nBrazil - 70,000 mt MAP at $500/mt CFR\\nBrazil -30,000 mt TSP at $400/mt CFR\\nBrazil -100,000 mt allocated and not yet priced – targeting $510/mt CFR\\nEurope - 80,000 mt DAP/MAP sold at $505-510/mt FOB comprising 20,000 mt DAP to Romania, 20,000 mt DAP/MAP for Poland, 15,000 mt DAP for Spain and 10,000 mt for France\\nDomestic – 30,000 mt DAP/NPK\\nAfrica – 60,000 mt NPKs, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria but some 12-24-12 for Benin.\\nOCP is indicating $330/mt FOB for 15-15-15 sales into African markets and $350/mt FOB for sales into Europe.\\nThe above (including a portion for Turkey) totals 385,000 mt granulated products but equates to nearer 350,000 mt DAP equivalent when calculated from a P2O5 basis.\\nPhosacid shipments will run at a rate of around 120,000 mt P2O5 this month comprising 90,000 mt P2O5 for India and the balance for Pakistan.\\nFor July, OCP is to ship around 80,000 mt MAP/DAP to the US, split between PCS and Koch, priced on a formula basis. This may be loaded on one vessel or could be increased to comprise 2 x 50,000 mt lots.\\nOCP is also planning to ship 50-70,000 mt to China in July, under its government-to-government agreement.\\nStart-up for OCP\\'s first JPH complex at Jorf Lasfar is still scheduled for end June/early July, as reported last week. Output of granulated products will remain relatively low while production at the phosphoric acid unit is ramped up through Q3.\\nOCP is still indicating start-up of the additional three JPH plants, each with 475,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid capacity plus DAP/MAP/NPKs, at six monthly intervals thereafter with the fourth scheduled for end 2016.\\nTunisia: CPG resumes rock production at one mine\\nCPG has re-started phosphate rock production at its Kef Eddour mine after a three-week total stoppage and months of strikes, sit-ins and general disruption.\\nEmployees of the company also resumed work earlier this week at CPG headquarters in Gafsa.\\nProduction at the remaining rock mines, e.g. Metlaoui, Oom Larayes, M\\'dhilla and Redayef, is still understood to be suspended. It is still early days and a return to some normality is yet to be achieved given the scale of the crisis to beset the region this year and which has escalated over the past two months to finally bring the industry to its knees.\\nAs reported previously, rock supplies at all the downstream units have been exhausted and as such it will be a little time before fresh deliveries of finished fertilizers or phosphoric acid are available for export. Calls for the import of phosphate rock last week to bring some relief to the downstream operations may now be retracted if attempts to resume indigenous rock production are successful.\\nTurkey is GCT\\'s key market for the coming weeks and months and it will not wish to jeopardise its market share or its relationship with Gubretas by not being in a position to supply the latter\\'s requirements. Therefore with this and the start of southern European DAP demand in just a few weeks, DAP production at Gabes is likely to be given priority in the near term. In the meantime, it will deliver 18,000 mt to Gubretas this month out of stocks as part of its supply agreement.\\nGCT\\'s last confirmed shipment was a 6,000 mt DAP lot into Italy at the beginning of May. Price on this shipment has not been disclosed.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBangladesh: MoA tender closing on May 31\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture\\'s (MoA) will close its tender on May 31 for the private sector supply of DAP, TSP and MOP to Bangladesh.\\nThe tender will close on May 31 for a total of 400,000 mt DAP, 200,000 mt TSP and 240,000 mt MOP, all for shipment by September. Individual companies can submit offers for a maximum of 40,000 mt DAP, 30,000 mt TSP or 24,000 mt MOP. However, there is no known quota on quantities from the same origins.\\nAny request for extension to the shipment period will be decided by the MoA on a case by case\\nbasis. Letters of credit will be opened 5 days after receiving approval from the MoA. Product not meeting the inspection will result in the blacklisting of both importer and manufacturer.\\nThe tender will attract offers of DAP from China, Australia and probably Saudi Arabia also. Availbility of TSP will be tight, particularly for prompt shipment. Lebanon Chemicals traditionally takes a good proportion of this\\nbusiness but with the latest developments in Syria, LCC\\'s production could be jeopardised in the short term. Chinese TSP is banned and Tunisian production has been suspended.\\nPakistan: Further details on DAP sales emerge\\nBoth importers rumoured to have pending DAP cargoes before IFA are understood to have finalised June cargoes.\\nChawla purchased a cargo of Chinese DAP while Pakarab is believed to have booked Saudi product. Price details are sketchy at press-time but are likely to be in line with recent sales from both origins, i.e. in the low $480s/mt CFR for Chinese and upper $480s/mt for Saudi.\\nIndia: PhosAgro DAP/NPK deal with IPL over 3 years\\nFurther details are emerging on the sale of 1.35 million mt Russian DAP/NPKs reported yesterday. The deal between PhosAagro and IPL is over a three year period between 2015 and 2018 suggesting around 400- 450,000 mt per year and will include15-15-15 and 10-26-26 as well as DAP and NPS.\\nThis deal follows the flurry of cargoes sold for March/April shipment by PhosAgro to IPL and IFFCO earlier this year. Around nine cargoes, mainly DAP, were shipped with the DAP priced in the low-mid $480s/mt CFR. All these cargoes have now been loaded and have either arrived or are on the water, but it has not yet been confirmed whether any of the IPL cargoes are included in the current year\\'s contract.\\nPhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.\\nIndia: UP tender offers in $478-489.99/mt CFR range\\nUttar Pradesh has opened the price offers against its tender of May 16 for 300,000 mt DAP. Prices were in the $478-489.99/mt CFR range.\\nKerala Sidco offered the lowest.\\nAgainst its tender of May 18 for 20,000 mt granular 11-44-0 or DAP lite, RCF has awarded the business to Fertisul, who offered GMAP 11-44-0 at $410.50/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Producers still take united stance on price\\nProducers remain united on price in India, with the larger producers sticking to the $480/mt CFR India level while slightly lower can be achieved from the mid-tier and smaller producers. As such the range published in Fertilizer Week remains unchanged from last week.\\nPressure remains on suppliers to lower prices in India by as much as $10/mt while one producer at least is looking for a reduction to $465/mt CFR. This would give a netback to the low $450s/mt FOB or lower, depending on freight.\\nSuppliers are comfortable for the short term and aside from India, are expecting solid demand to start in Pakistan along with the imminent tender in Bangladesh for 400,000 mt DAP.\\nChinese 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 price levels are firm in the mid-to-high $420s/mt FOB and the mid $390s/mt FOB respectively. With Brazil expected to show strong demand through June and into July for Chinese granular products, price levels will remain firm and availability tight.\\nChina: Jan-April DAP/MAP exports hit 2 million mt\\nThe latest GTIS data for January-April show DAP/MAP exports at 2 million mt already. This is a considerable volume and above most expectations for the time of year. This total comprised 1.4 million mt DAP and 605,000 mt MAP. Comparable quantities for 2013 and 2014 were just 1.1 million mt and 275,000 mt DAP/MAP respectively.\\nLooking at April itself, China exported 481,000 mt DAP including 173,000 mt for India and a further 75,000 mt for Vietnam and 55,000 mt for Thailand.\\nApril MAP exports reached 124,000 mt including 57,000 mt for Brazil.\\nChinese NP exports (including 11-44-0) for April reached 58,000 mt including cargoes for India, Kenya and the Philippines. This brought the total for the year to date to just over 300,000 mt, again well above previous years.\\nExports of SSP/TSP through January-April were slightly down on last year and while exports of SSP were slightly higher, it was TSP shipments that fell year on year. China exported 198,000 mt TSP in the first four months, down from 270,000 mt over the same period in 2014. A lack of any shipments to Iran to date in 2015 has been the sole reason for the drop in export volumes this year as quantities to other markets remained buoyant.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSyria: Islamic State attack threatens Syrian rock\\nThis week\\'s attack on Palmyra and the surrounding region by the so-called Islamic State (IS) threatens the production of Syrian phosphate rock at Knaifess.\\nDespite the troubles, Syria has managed to export regular quantities of rock since 2011, albeit in much- reduced quantities. In Q1 this year, it exported 44,000 mt rock to Greece, according to GTIS, along with additional quantities to the Ukraine, Bulgaria and Italy.\\nLebanon Chemical\\'s TSP production traditionally depends on Syrian rock and as a result of this latest development, TSP availability from LCC will almost certainly be affected unless an alternative rock source is found.\\nJordan: Q2 phosphate rock prices confirmed\\nPhosphate rock prices for Q2 have been confirmed with an increase on Q1 as follows: 68-70% BPL at $120/mt FOB for shipments to India and $122-124/mt FOB for other destnations; 73-75% BPL at $130- 134/mt fob for India and $132-136/mt FOB for non-Indian markets. The price assessment for 66-70% BPL this week only reflects the changed price for 68-70% BPL as details on the lower grade are not yet available.\\nNP/NPKS\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: NPK prices increase on good demand\\nVietnam imported 57,188 mt of NPKs in April bringing its January-April NPK imports to more than 100,000 mt with Q1 NPK production seen at over 560,000 mt.\\nMay continued to see shipments into Vietnam and current prices are around $405-410/mt CFR.\\nThe Thailand and Myanmar markets are seeing even higher prices currently, putting the range at $410- 420/mt CFR.

Although exact quantities have not been released, the deal is believed to be for more than 700,000 mt at the new contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nThe agreement brings total contracted Indian potash volumes so far to 3.5-3.7 million mt, including some optional tonnage, compared to a total of 3.9 million mt last year. ICL and K+S is still to agree volumes (roughly 700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), but ICL is unlikely to sign a deal to India unless ongoing strikes at its Dead Sea Works operations can be brought to an end.\\nPhosAgro also signed a three-year NPK supply deal to IPL during IFA for 1.35 million mt after a nearly two-year absence. The deal may lead to a slowdown in the domestic NPK production increases which have recently helped boost Indian demand for potash but with most potash contracts already signed to India, overall Indian potash imports are expected to increase to 4.4-4.8 million mt in the current fertilizer year from 4.2 million mt last year.\\nThe increase in Indian demand runs parallel to a recent volume increase in Chinese contracts (6.1 million mt) and Chinese imports data, which shows an 18% increase in potash deliveries between January and April to 2.4 million mt. While demand is expected to fall in some global markets like Brazil during 2015, it is unlikely that deliveries will fall as far as some are expecting, still total demand should be in the range of 58-60.4 million mt in 2015.\\nPrices in the global spot markets have been significantly weaker than suppliers had targeted so far in 2015. This week, US prices have continued their downward trend with key planting largely completed in the Midwest and demand dropping across the buying regions. Prices in the US south have fallen to as low as $380/st FOB while NOLA barge prices cannot be seen higher than $325/st FOB.\\nIn Southeast Asia, prices are largely the same but Malaysian sMOP quotes have lowered to $310-315/mt CFR with current larger tenders unlikely to push up prices in the near term. The price range across the region is seen at $310- 350/mt CFR with the upper end of deals only seen in the smaller markets like The Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\\nIn Europe prices are also flat with potash buying out of season. Granular potash is quoted at €305-315/mt CIF with most quotes at €310/mt CIF, while standard quotes are seen at the very weak level of €270-280/mt CIF.\\nMost suppliers at IFA were highlighting the Brazilian market as their opportunity to boost spot prices in 2015 after the lacklustre start to 2015. The major suppliers have set their June and July delivery prices at $340-345/mt CFR and hope that they can further increase prices through until October. If some of these gains can be achieved in Brazil over the coming months it will likely have a knock on effect in the other spot markets by the end of the year but spot prices are unlikely to reach the levels they ended 2014.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙BPC signs Indian quantities above 700,000 mt with IPL and 3 others\\n∙Total Indian volumes now seen at 3.5-3.7 million mt\\n∙BPC wins RCF tender for up to 265,000 mt MOP\\n∙Suppliers target $340-345/mt in Brazil for June/July deliveries\\n∙US prices fall further, US NOLA $325/st FOB and US South $380/st FOB\\n∙Southeast Asian potash prices dip slightly, $310-350/mt CFR vs $315-350/mt CFR\\n∙PhosAgro signs three-year Indian NPK supply deal for 1,35 million mt\\n∙Europe out of season, prices flat at €305-315/mt CIF\\n∙Chinese domestic prices flat at RMB2,030-2,130/mt FCA\\n∙Canpotex agrees to supply up to $60 m worth of potash to Bangladesh\\n∙China MOP imports up 18% Jan-Apr to 2.4 million mt\\n∙BPC postpones maintenance plans for RU-2 and RU-3\\n∙Europe SOP prices increase, €460-500/mt FCA vs €450-470/mt FCA\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S Plains: Truck values flat despite resupply problem\\nGranular potash truck values have not gained, despite the lack of resupply available from the barge market due to regional flooding. Quotes for potash from terminals along the Arkansas River remain around $380/st FOB, but distributors report retailers already have sufficient tons in hand to meet their remaining seasonal commitments.\\nUS NOLA: Little demand remains for potash\\nModest demand remains for granular potash, and it appears further price cuts from the current price tag of $325/st FOB New Orleans will do little if anything to boost demand at this stage of the season.\\nUS buyers expect BPC will participate in the import market over the summer, perhaps shipping as much as 200,000 mt to the US. However, no deals are believed settled with potential importers at press time.\\nUS Midwest: Potash needs met for season\\nGranular potash demand from retailers is down substantially, as corn and soybean planting is largely completed across the region.\\nFarmers generally are concerned with secondary nitrogen applications at this stage, and there is little enthusiasm for potential fill offers from Canadian producers in coming weeks.\\nDistributors suggest a discount of $20/st from recent retail values in the $380s/st FOB Midwest would might be needed to drive summer fill sales. However, with only moderate amounts of offshore potash likely to arrive over the summer, domestic producers may not have to give that much ground.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Suppliers target $340-345/mt CFR in Brazil\\nBrazil is now seen as the key region for increasing potash spot prices after a weak H1, with US and European markets largely out of season and the Southeast Asian market likely to see little change from their current weak levels until autumn.\\nPrices are currently seen at $330-340/mt CFR with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. BPC and SQM are currently looking for $340/mt CFR for June/July deliveries and Uralkali have priced July deliveries at $345/mt CFR. Canpotex is believed to also be pricing in the $340-345/mt CFR range for June/July deliveries.\\nWith Q1 Brazilian potash imports very low, buyers are expected to pick up high levels of volumes in the next few months in order to limit delays at port during September and October.\\nSuppliers plan to take a staged approach to price increases and if $340-345/mt levels can be maintained for July deliveries then suppliers will likely try to push for $350-370/mt levels before the end of the Brazilian season. However, the $380/mt CFR price achieved by October 2014 is unlikely to be reached before the end of 2015.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Belaruskali postpones maintenance plans\\nBelaruskali postponed planned maintenance at RU-2 at the end of May and at RU-3 at the start of June.\\nThe company made the decision to continue its current high rate of shipments to China and the forthcoming deliveries to India under the new contract.\\nIt is unclear when the sites will go down for maintenance, if at all in 2015.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Action slows and prices unchanged\\nThe European potash market has entered its end of season lull with gMOP prices stable at €305-315/mt CIF ($332-344).\\nMost suppliers quote prices around €310/mt CIF after K+S increased its prices to €315/mt CIF earlier in May but note that deals are currently limited.\\nStandard potash prices in Europe are seen at the exceptionally weak level of around €270-280/mt CIF ($294-305) pushing suppliers to focus standard deliveries on other markets. However, some sources indicate possible tightness in standard supply during 2015 with large supplies going to India and China while BPC is said to be producing at as high as 70-80% granular product.\\nTight supply may help the standard European market see some recovery in the coming months.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: BPC agrees Indian potash volumes\\nBelarusian potash exporter BPC has signed its Indian quantity agreements for the current fertilizer year ending March 2016 with both regular BPC buyer IPL and three others but the exact quantity has yet to be announced.\\nIt is believed that the company has agreed to an increase in volumes above the 700,000 mt sent by BPC to India in the previous fertilizer year.\\nThe deal further backs up expectations of an increase in Indian demand during the current fertilizer year despite the $10/mt increase in the current contract price to $332/mt with 180 days credit.\\nThe agreement brings total potash volumes, including some of the optional tonnage, to around 3.5-3.7 million mt. With further optional tonnage also likely to be sent to India, spot deals and tenders through the year, and both ICL and K+S still to sign volumes (700,000 mt and 200,000 mt last year respectively), Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014’s 4.2 million mt.\\nAccording to Indian vessel data, around 50,000 mt has been booked for arrival in the first two weeks of June and May deliveries totalled only around 200,000 mt as suppliers agreed contracts for the new fertilizer year.\\nBangladesh: Canpotex agrees BADC deal\\nCanpotex is to supply as much as $60 million of potash to Bangladesh in the current fertilizer year.\\nThe deal was signed between the Canadian Commercial Corp on behalf of Canpotex and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and includes $40 million worth of potash and an additional $20 million in optional volumes.\\nThe exact volumes have not been announced but are likely to be similar to the 120,000 mt signed during 2014 for $40 million between Canpotex and BADC, which also included an option worth $20 million for an additional 60,000 mt.\\nIndia: BPC awarded RCF MOP tender\\nBPC has been awarded RCF\\'s tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional MOP, closed on May 7.\\nThe Belarusian producer was awarded the tender at the new Indian contract price of $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nMMTC, IPL and Transmart DMCC also made offers at $332/mt CFR with 180 days.\\nDelivery is split into three shipments to India in June for the firm volumes and two shipments in August for the optional tonnes.\\nThe MMTC tender for 145,000 mt, which was expected as cover to offer in the RCF tender, is believed likely to be scrapped.\\nPrice offers on the NFL tender for 50,000 mt which closed on May 10 have yet to be announced but should be released in the next few days.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: MOP imports at high level in 2015\\nVietnam imported 106,505 mt of potash in April, a 24% increase year on year, according to port data, with high levels of imports believed to be continuing through May.\\nNPK production was seen at over 560,000 mt in Q1 2015 and the January-April MOP imports total 365,000, up 23% on 2014. Currently Vietnamese potash prices are quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.\\nChina: Domestic prices flat amid high imports\\nWith the end of spring application season, domestic potash purchasing activity in China has become slow and thin. Most distributors and downstream users adopt hand-to-mouth buying strategies.\\nPrices on the whole remain stable. Despite wholesale prices still ranging from RMB 2,000- 2,130/mt FCA ($323-344/mt) at port, the mainstream prices of 62% K2O white MOP slid again and dealt at RMB 2,100/mt FCA ($339/mt) this week, while the high end still stands at RMB 2,130/mt with small quantities.\\nAs Fertilizer Week estimated, the April imports reached 822,612 tonnes, up by 9.1% on the 747,774 tonnes imported in April 2014. The January-April imports totalled 2.81 million tonnes, up by 18.1% on the 2.38 million tonnes imported during the same period in 2014.\\nBPC is currently the biggest supplier to China, accounting for nearly 30% of total January-April imports. In addition, shipments from Laos seem more consistent since Oct 2014. China imported\\n65,827 tonnes of MOP from Laos in January-April 2015, making the country the 7th largest exporter to China, exceeding Chile and Uzbekistan.\\nSoutheast Asia: Suppliers struggling to push up prices\\nMalaysian potash prices have slipped to as low as $310-315/mt CFR with the current larger tenders unlikely to achieve higher prices in the near term and significant price increases later in the year largely reliant on a price push in Brazil.\\nCurrency depreciation, weak agricultural commodity prices and high competition in the country have forced the Malaysian price below even the new Chinese contract level but suppliers hope they can achieve at least $330/mt CFR levels between September and December when the market builds again.\\nIndonesia is also priced below the $330/mt CFR level with some suppliers quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR.\\nVietnam and Thailand prices are seen at $330-345/mt CFR. High levels of imports are being seen into both countries including recent shipments from Uralkali and BPC.\\nSmall deals to the Philippines continue to be quoted as high as $350/mt CFR for Canpotex volumes. The total range in Southeast Asia is now seen at $310-350/mt CFR.\\nSOP\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: SOP prices increase further in tight market\\nThe European SOP market remains tight and prices have increased to the high level of €460-500/mt FCA from €450-470/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €520/mt FCA.\\nAfter a bumper year in 2014 regarding SOP production in China, some Chinese volumes are managing to make it into the European market for spot deals but not enough has arrived to have any effect on the under supply situation.\\nBetween January and April, China exported 43,275 mt SOP, around 70% of its entire 2015 exports and more than five times than the same period in 2014. Just under half of the exports went straight to the European market.\\nTessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year.\\nK+S may also choose to increase SOP production in Europe towards the end of 2016, replacing some European MOP production with SOP when its major Legacy potash mine in Saskatchewan begins production.\\nNPKS\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP announces Toros deal, African deliveries\\nOCP has also announced an agreement to supply 50-100,000 mt DAP and some NPKs to Toros/Turkey for June-September shipment. Price details have not yet been disclosed.\\nOCP is planning to send 60,000 mt NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria but some 12-24-12 for Benin.\\nThe Moroccan producer is indicating $330/mt FOB for 15-15-15 sales into African markets and $350/mt FOB for sales into Europe. Other NPK suppliers to Europe say that deals are very hard to come by with the market now out of season and prices continue to be quoted at $325-335/mt FOB Baltic.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: PhosAgro agrees three-year Indian NPK deal\\nPhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India during the IFA conference this week.\\nThe deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but is believed to also include DAP.\\nThis deal follows the flurry of shipments (mainly DAP cargoes) sold for March/April shipment by PhosAgro to IPL and IFFCO earlier this year.\\nPhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: NPK imports increase with jump in Russian deliveries\\nChina imported 413,428 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 64% increase on the previous year but lower than the same period in 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, China imported 140,000 mt from Russian producers, more than a three-fold increase year on year, after low levels of NPK deliveries during 2014, while Yara also delivered 140,000 mt NPKs.\\nIt was expected that higher domestic NPK production in China would continue to push down imports in 2015 after an 18% fall in imports during 2014 but with some small Chinese NPK plants down in H1 due to environmental concerns and demand remaining strong, international suppliers have increased deliveries.\\nApril saw an increase in NPK volumes to China with140,000 mt imported; the highest April levels since 2007, with Russian producers providing 40% of the April deliveries.\\nSoutheast Asia: NPK prices increase on solid demand\\nVietnam imported 57,188 mt NPKs in April bringing its January-April NPK imports to more than 100,000 mt with Q1 NPK production exceeding 560,000 mt.\\nMay has continued to see shipments into Vietnam and current prices are around $405-410/mt CFR.\\nThe Thailand and Myanmar markets are achieving even higher prices, putting the range at $410-420/mt CFR. As a result Southeast Asian NPK prices have increased by $5-10/mt and are seen in the $405-420/mt CFR range.\\nNEWS\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nUralkali investors tender 11.89% of shares\\nUralkali said investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback, less than it had looked for when the plan was announced.\\nThe deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.\\nUralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.\\nUralkali offered $3.20/share and $16/GDR for as much as a 15.97% stake in the company.\\nThe company said the plan, which will be funded by its existing cash-flow, was intended to help distribute cash to security-holders at a time when giving out dividends would not comply with company policy. It recommended waiving a dividend based on its full-year 2014 numbers. Major owners in Uralkali, Mikhail Prokhorov\\'s Onexim Group and Uralchem, both voted against the payment of an interim dividend in December 2014.\\nUralkali, which had a cash balance of $2.5 billion at the end of 2014, eventually plans to cancel the acquired shares.\\nIn March, Uralkali announced a new strategy for 2015-2020 in the wake of flooding at its 2.3 million mt/year Solikamsk-2 mine. The $4.5 billion investment plan to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years includes construction of a new mine at SK-2.\\nUralkali also recently agreed on a $530 million loan deal with a range of international lenders, Russian business\\' first international loan of 2015.\\nEarlier in May, major shareholder UralChem announced that it would not take part in the share buyback, considering the investment as \\'strategic\\', leaving more opportunity for minority shareholders, including Acron, to get a better return.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

However, with phosphate production rates expected to remain steady and domestic prices already roughly equivalent to import offers, import purchases are expected to increase.\\nChina’s April imports were up 24% on the year at 1.05 million mt, split between around 70 importers.\\nIndian prices remained pegged in the $160-170/mt CFR range, while Brazilian prices remained pegged within the $150-160/mt CFR range.\\nReliance’s sales tender was reported awarded to Sumstar in the low $140s/mt FOB.\\nThe Vancouver FOB spot price assessment also remained unchanged at $125-135/mt FOB, though business at the lower end of the range would likely be difficult to come by at this stage.\\nElsewhere, JPMC issued its latest tender for 50,000 mt.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Tasweeq posts June QSP at $141/mt FOB, up $2/mt\\n∙Middle East spot reported in mid-$140s/mt FOB\\n∙Reliance tender awarded in low $140s/mt FOB\\n∙Chinese April imports up 24% on year\\n∙Further small increases in domestic Chinese prices\\n∙JPMC issues latest 50,000 mt tender\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: FOB spot business mostly in $130s/mt\\nSpot prices for Canadian seaborne exports remain pegged at $125-135/mt FOB Vancouver, though it is likely that the lower end of this range may now be more difficult to obtain.\\nA few buyers have reported recent purchases below $130/mt FOB, but most current price ideas are in the $130-135/mt FOB range.\\nVancouver FOB price decreases lagged price falls elsewhere, and were still around $170/mt FOB when Middle Eastern prices had already declined to the low $150s/mt FOB in early April. They therefore subsequently underwent a steeper, more rapid decline.\\nOne buyer said it had bought an extra parcel because of current low prices.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Sulphur spot prices stable\\nBrazilian prices have remained stable in recent weeks, with sources quoting prices in from $150/mt to $165/mt CFR and the spot assessment still $150-160/mt CFR.\\nAs this is roughly in line with contract prices, buyers do not feel a great incentive to buy.\\nMeanwhile, Anglo American is expected to return to the market with its next purchase tender around mid June.\\nEUROPE\\nMediterranean: Prices mostly stable\\nSpot prices for sulphur cargoes of 10,000 mt and less in the Mediterranean region were mostly stable, though there were some indications of higher levels in Turkey.\\nAn Italian buyer reported offer levels of $130-135/mt CFR, while a seller reported bids from Greece and Turkey around $125-130/mt CFR.\\nSome players suggested that availability had improved after Lukoil’s Isab refinery in Priolo, Italy, completed its recent maintenance in late April. Meanwhile, Hellenic Petroleum’s refinery in Aspropyrgos, Greece, is currently in a turnaround that started April 20 and is set to be complete at the end of May.\\nAnother trader quoted price levels of $140-145/mt CFR in Turkey and $135-140/mt CFR in Egypt, and argued that availability in the Med was in fact quite limited and was expected to remain so until late June.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Spot sales reported higher\\nSpot prices for Middle Eastern exports have been stronger recently, with some sales from Adnoc and Aramco reported as high as $145-148/mt FOB.\\nSome traders see a lack of spot cargo availability from Middle Eastern sellers, despite overall spot business being fairly quiet in recent months. Sellers are understood to have had strong contractual offtake, with some saying they are fully booked at least through June.\\nOne seller source saw the market as balanced to slightly bearish, although the odd spot enquiry was evident from some sources.\\nTunisia: Some phosphate rock restarts\\nCPG has re-started phosphate rock production at its Kef Eddour mine after a three-week total stoppage and months of strikes, sit-ins and general disruption.\\nEmployees of the company also resumed work earlier this week at CPG headquarters in Gafsa.\\nProduction at the remaining rock mines is still understood to be suspended and a return to some normality is yet to be achieved given the scale of the crisis that beset the region this year.\\nSulphur market participants viewed it as a \"wait-and-see\" situation in terms of possible effects on sulphur demand, which has been volatile from the region for some time.\\nFor more details, see the phosphates section.\\nJordan: JPMC issues 50,000 mt tender\\nJPMC has issued a tender for 50,000 mt sulphur for July 15-20 arrival. The tender closes June 2.\\nThe buyer\\'s last tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.\\nAs reported in the phosphates section, JPMC will be producing around 450,000 mt DAP this year, down from close to 650,000 mt in 2014. Increased emphasis will be given to phosphoric acid this year including shipments into Indonesia, India and Turkey.\\nQatar: Tasweeq posts $141/mt FOB for June\\nTasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for June 2015 at $141/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $2/mt from its May level.\\nEarlier this month, Aramco Trading posted its June price at $142/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its May price.\\nThe announcement follows Tasweeq\\'s most recent sales tender for 35,000 mt, which closed last week and was reportedly awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.\\nThe new QSP equates to delivered prices in China in the high $150s/mt CFR, at the upper end of the range currently deemed achievable.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Reliance tender goes in low $140s/mt FOB\\nReliance’s latest sales tender for 25,000 mt granular sulphur, which closed on May 25, was reportedly awarded to Sumstar at just above $142/mt FOB. The tender has a laycan of June 15-19.\\nPrice ideas were initially around $145-146/mt FOB, but this seems to have been overly bullish.\\nIndia: Prices stable; RCF to decide tender\\nSulphur prices in India remained unchanged at $160-170/mt CFR, though no recent business has been reported at the upper end of this range.\\nOffers on RCF’s 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15 were INR 9,093/mt EXW from Reliance, INR 10,515/mt EXW from Essar, INR 8,485/mt EXW from MRPL, and $170/mt CFR from Swiss Singapore. The buyer is expected to decide on an award by June 1.\\nAn East Asian trader reported a bid from a buyer at $165/mt CFR.\\nElsewhere, IFFCO had a cargo of 27,000 mt arriving on the Imperial Eagle May 27 at a price around $160/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Price stability persists as activity limited\\nChinese sulphur prices were again mostly stable week on week, with some minor domestic increases.\\nPort inventories showed a very slight recovery to around 950,000 mt, seemingly due to the arrival of a vessel with around 45,000 mt of crushed lump product from Saudi Arabia.\\nOffer prices for imported granular sulphur remained pegged at $155-160/mt CFR, but with limited business. Crushed lump was in the $140s/mt CFR, though Russian product was said to be available in the low $130s/mt CFR. Molten prices were reported from the low $140s/mt to mid-$150s/mt CFR, although there was talk of distressed Korean cargoes in the low $130s/mt FOB.\\nMost activity was limited to term contracts, with buyers generally resisting offer prices.\\nGranular prices at port were RMB 1,160-1,180/mt FCA, with some quotes at Fangcheng up to RMB 1,200/mt, although no trades were reported at this quoted level. Crushed lump prices were RMB 1,070- 1,080/mt FCA.\\nAt the Jiangsu commodity exchange, sulphur futures for June were around RMB 1,150/mt, though trading volumes are thin.\\nThe lack of price movements has reportedly led many traders to shift away from sulphur and into equities.\\nSinopec’s Puguang again increased prices May 24, bringing its ex-factory price up to RMB 1,170/mt EXW. This is now the same level as its price at Wenzhou port, which is RMB 1,170/mt FCA.\\nAs the producer’s prices are now similar to port prices, traders do not feel threatened by its supply. The producer has successfully reduced its stocks at plant to around a third of its storage capacity, and they are now around 30,000 mt of granular sulphur and 20,000 mt of molten. Puguang’s April production was 183,000 mt, roughly in line with 2014 levels and above recent months.\\nMost domestic refineries have cut production, with some maintenances from April to early June.\\nChina: April sulphur imports jump 24%\\nChina’s April imports of sulphur were up 23.8% year on year at 1.05 million mt, somewhat offsetting the low volume of the previous month and leaving total imports for the first four months of the year down 2.3% at 3.61 million mt.\\nKazakhstan supplied 204,238 mt of the April volumes, demonstrating that it is still a key source of Chinese sulphur. This marks the highest monthly volume to Japan from Kazakhstan since February 2013.\\nOther key sources were Saudi Arabia (163,678 mt), Iran (120,377 mt), South Korea (107,777 mt), and the UAE (88,268 mt).\\nIndia and Turkmenistan both supplied more than usual, at 84,579 mt and 77,070 mt respectively.\\nJapan was the source of 76,556 mt and Canada supplied 64,937 mt after not sending any tonnes for February or March.\\nThe volumes were split between around 70 importers.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

With recent business as high as $70/mt CFR and a continuing lack of spot availability, with sulphur-burnt product from China likely to come at an even higher price, $25/mt FOB was well achievable on some East Asian producers’ sales.\\nBut it is not certain how long Indian spot demand will continue, and with Glencore’s PASAR smelter coming out of maintenance by the end of Q2 with some expansion likely, support for higher prices could diminish in the coming weeks.\\nHowever, an expected reduction in export volumes from Mexico’s Boleo will remove at least some marginal supply from the market.\\nSpot prices to Chile, meanwhile, were reported relatively stable in the $80s/mt CFR.\\nChina’s April imports plunged 29.3% year on year, leaving total imports for the first four months of the year down 12.1% at 374,349 mt.\\nEuropean spot prices for exports, on the other hand, continued to be assessed at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with current business continuing at the levels of recent months.\\nPetrobras entered the market again and is believed to have bought in the high $80s/mt CFR, though the price was not confirmed and some believed it might be in the $90s/mt CFR.\\nA sale to Argentina reported in the $90s/mt CFR was also in line with business a month earlier.\\nSpot demand for imports to the US and Morocco was still lacking.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Asian FOB prices up on tightness\\n∙Further Indian demand for prompt spot\\n∙Sales to Bunge Argentina reported in $90s/mt CFR\\n∙Petrobras returns to market with prices talked in high $80s/mt CFR\\n∙Boleo exports continue but likely to slow soon\\n∙Chilean business in $80s/mt CFR\\n∙Chinese imports for April plunge 29.3%\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals continued to decline and shed gains from the rally that took place earlier this month, as confidence remained shaky and macro data overall was not supportive. Dollar weakness in the latter part of the week should add some support to price levels. LME copper was down to $6,084.50/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nThis week\\'s IFA meeting did not yield any news that would affect expectations for US phosphate production. This leaves sulphur and sulphuric acid suppliers with the same outlook as earlier this month for the US Gulf.\\nSulphur markets were stable to slightly higher. Tasweeq moved its QSP up $2/mt to $141/mt FOB, roughly in line with expectations but fairly conservative, as spot business from the Middle East was reported in the mid- $140s/mt FOB and the seller\\'s recent tender went at the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB. With the price announced and IFA discussion out of the way, activity is expected to pick up over the coming week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices were stable at last week\\'s level of $1,750-1800/mt CFR China following several weeks of increases to their highest levels since early January.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nMexico: Exports from Boleo plant likely to decline in H2\\nThe Boleo mine’s exports of sulphuric acid out of Santa Rosalia port are likely to decline from July onwards.\\nIt exported around two cargoes of 18-20,000 mt per month so far this year, but this is likely to decline to around one cargo per month as it ramps up its plant.\\nBoleo began producing copper January 17, and has been a key source of marginal acid supply, with most cargoes going to Chile, although some material has gone to Brazil.\\nCRU estimates that Boleo’s maximum consumption of sulphuric acid this year would be around 350,000 mt, while it is able to produce twice that much.\\nMeanwhile, spot import price ideas in Mexico remain in the $80s/mt CFR following Fertinal\\'s purchase of two 25,000 mt cargoes, one of which arrived at the beginning of May on the Sanga Breeze while the other was scheduled to load from South Korea on the Sea Onsam on May 20 for June arrival.\\nUS: Spot imports lacking\\nUS sulphuric acid prices remained assessed at $70-80/mt CFR, with no new business confirmed.\\nAlthough there was talk of some smaller trades, nothing was confirmed, and some traders said that US import business was currently dead.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras returns to sulphuric acid market\\nPetrobras entered the market for 15,000 mt of sulphuric acid intended for early July delivery.\\nPrice were talked in the high $80s/mt CFR, though a final conclusion price was not confirmed and some traders believed it would may be in the $90s/mt CFR.\\nThe buyer’s purchase of 15,000 mt in April for June delivery is understood to have been at $87/mt CFR, in line with Brazilian prices of recent months. Subsequent to this, Mosaic bought 12,000 mt in the mid-to-high $80s/mt CFR.\\nChile: Spot business reported close to $80/mt CFR\\nChilean spot prices remain pegged at $80-90/mt CFR, though most price ideas are at the lower end of this range.\\nSources report that recent purchases have been close to $80/mt CFR. Demand has come from typical buyers such as BHP Billiton.\\nArgentina: Bunge heard buying in $90s/mt CFR\\nBunge Argentina has again purchased sulphuric acid in the $90s/mt CFR, according to market sources.\\nThis is in line with its previous purchase in March.\\nThe company\\'s acid requirements are driven by its SSP facilities in Ramallo.\\nIn October, the buyer reportedly bought a parcel of around 12,000 mt at a price of approximately $110/mt CFR.\\nArgentinian imports for 2014 totalled 64,482 mt based on one purchase of 14-17,000 mt per quarter.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot stability persists in balanced market\\nEuropean spot prices remained stable at an assessment of $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, where they have been for approximately four months.\\nRecent sales to Brazil have remained at similar levels, and spot demand elsewhere for European product was lacking.\\nDespite limited spot availability, there has been little impetus for any price climbs.\\nBoliden is currently conducting maintenance at its Harjavalta smelter in Finland. It recently completed a short maintenance at its Kokkola smelter, and is planning a turnaround at its Rönnskär plant in September. The company recently reported increased Q1 production volumes.\\nThe only other European smelter turnaround currently on the horizon in the region is Atlantic Copper’s Huelva site in September.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Spot demand persists but diminishing\\nIndian demand remained a key driver of Asian sulphuric acid spot markets, with limited spot enquiry from elsewhere while availability remained tight.\\nAlthough traders saw Indian business slower than a month ago, a large buyer was seeking prompt June-July product.\\nIFFCO had two spot cargoes arriving, one of 21,000 mt on the Golden Unity at around $70/mt CFR with an ETA of May 27 from Qatar and another of 20,000 mt on the White Shark at around $60/mt CFR with an ETA of June 3.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan/South Korea: Upper end of spot range up\\nThe upper end of the East Asian spot price assessment was moved up slightly, with the range now at $17- 25/mt FOB Japan/South Korea.\\nThe lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, but it is not clear whether this will be sustained, as Indian spot demand has declined slightly in recent weeks and is likely to decline further, while spot demand from other sources is limited.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc’s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc’s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days, though the length has yet to be confirmed.\\nChina: Price rises in some regions on lower availability\\nPrices have increased slightly in Northern China and Zhejiang province because of low stock levels and price increases from sulphur burners, though increases were only RMB 20-30/mt FCA.\\nDemand in Zhejiang is mainly industrial, particularly for caprolactam and fluoric acid, and it is therefore less linked to markets elsewhere.\\nTurnarounds in Northern China, including an upcoming maintenance at Feishang Copper in Inner Mongolia, have also been supportive of prices.\\nChina: April sulphuric acid imports drop 29%\\nChina’s April imports of sulphuric acid plunged 29.3% year on year to 106,972 mt, leaving total imports for the first four months of the year down 12.1% at 374,349 mt.\\nAlmost all of the April tonnes came from South Korea, though North Korea supplied 1,810 mt and Taiwan supplied 1,071 mt.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Sales are reported above the $300/mt FOB marker for prills to cover traders short on sales in India via the IPL tender and to Pakistan in the recent TCP sessions. Prilled values are now rapidly approaching those for granular urea.\\nUnlike prills, traders were generally cautious to short Chinese product in recent weeks, and attempts by sellers to secure traditional premiums for regular Chinese granular have not been successful. Superior Chinese product such as the China Blue granular does however still trade at premiums above $10/mt on prills.\\nA softer sentiment is definitely apparent for granular urea in the region, evidenced not only by limited buying interest in China, but also via low bids for the 60,000 mt premium quality product from Kaltim in Indonesia this week.\\nA shift in concentration from prilled to granular urea will obviously occur if regional values of the two grades should closely match, as enduser markets favour Chinese granular over Chinese prills.\\nThe overall market for granular urea nevertheless depends increasingly on sustained values in the US barge market, but these were also southbound for forward positions this week.\\nFinding the trend for granular urea barges in the US has been problematc all year, as traders continually sold forward tons substantially lower than the prompt market. This pattern was repeated this week, as spot granular urea barges changed hands in the $330s-$340s/st FOB New Orleans while 1H July barges sold around $305/st FOB. This pattern has made the US less attractive than other markets for granular urea, which ultimately has led to thin supplies on a prompt basis for the last couple of months.\\nIn Europe, buyers remain cautious and the majority of importers of granular product are yet to get on the band-wagon for significant quantities for August and beyond. Some buyers have nevertheless opted to hedge the forward market by purchasing parts of envisaged requirements close to current values. These decisions were undoubtedly influence by erratic output in North Africa in recent weeks.\\nBrazilian importers that were off for a holiday June 4 continued to play a waiting-game this week, evidently feeling convinced that a buyer\\'s market will return in July. Procurement anywhere close to the offers in the high $330s/mt CFR currently on the table is not regarded an advisable move by the importers, despite repeat reports of Middle East cargos originally intended for Brazil being diverted to the US and Australia.\\nPrilled values were not only gaining in China. Limited availability out of the Black Sea following Group DF\\'s decision to suspend urea output from Cherkassy triggered a 25,000 mt purchase by NF Trading to load in June to cover quantity-commitments via NF Italia, mainly to industrial clients. The $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy price suggested in the deal did raise some eyebrows in the trade, as offers for smaller quantities from Yuzhnyy were available to load in June some $5/mt lower.\\nOn the demand side, planting in the US slowed this week, with corn approaching completion. The US set 2015 blending volumes at 13.4 billion gallons, below market expectations and well below the 15\\nbillion gallons that were legislated.\\nThe Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to BRL 187.7 billion ($59.8 billion), termed a \\'generous surprise\\' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.\\nFarmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates in production loans to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to BRL 94.5 billion ($30.12 billion). For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75% per annum (p.a.), while larger producers who take a bulk of the funding will see rates of 8.75% p.a. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5% p.a. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates that are around 17-23% p.a.\\nWhile the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to fertilizer purchases. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit.\\nThe Indian Meteorological Department continues to be downbeat on its monsoon forecast, this week lowering likely rainfall levels to 88% of normal (93% last week). Indications are for 66% chance of a \\'deficient\\' monsoon and only a 6% chance of a \\'normal\\' season.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Offers to TCP in Pakistan plentiful, but at high prices compared to India`\\n∙Kaltim fails to achieve targets in June 3 sales tender for 60,000 mt granular\\n∙US granular settles into more modest price-range\\n∙Chinese prilled values surge close to granular on trader shorts\\n∙New Indian urea tender yet to be announced but is suggested imminent\\n∙Pakistan\\'s ECC clears more imports, but tenders yet to be floated\\n∙Brazilian importers reject high offers as news on increased credits emerge\\n∙Algerian exports continue and output to normalize shortly\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed. Market perception remains for significant oversupply in Q3 and into Q4, but cuts in output and pockets of regional shortages could well support current values into July. Forward length point to significant downward adjustments in prices, but the timing of the corrections is still open for debate.\\nContinued price-strength beyond July 15 does however appear questionable and traders are already evaluating timing for possible short positions. Once and when over the \"edge\", urea values will undoubtedly suffer from lack of market liquidity, suggesting that downward corrections may be quite substantial.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: Conditions still drying out\\nRetailers are adding to their urea positions but relatively little product has moved to the ground this week, mostly due to the soggy conditions. Once corn acres are more supportive for application equipment, a surge in demand is expected that distributors will find difficult to meet.\\nNew tows have not been able to start up the flooded Arkansas River for a week and another week of at least slow movement is anticipated. As a result, truck values generally remain around $390/st FOB in Oklahoma and Arkansas.\\nUS: April plunge in arrivals aided recent price strength\\nEven though the plunge in US urea imports during April was expected, much of the marketplace did not forecast quite such a decline as was reported this week by the US Department of Commerce. April arrivals fell to 695,753 st (631,183 mt) from 1.06 million st (963,427 mt) one year earlier. Apparent denial on the part of many traders about the April volumes likely fueled the strong prices seen in May\\'s barge market.\\nMost of the decline in arrivals was spread relatively evenly across traditional suppliers to the US. Somewhat surprisingly the decline in shipments from Caribbean suppliers Venezuela and Trinidad was the most stark, with just 4,439 st arriving in April 2015 versus 151,704 st in April 2014. The largest suppliers to the US duiring April of this yea included Qatar at 170,685 st, UAE at 145,916 st and Canada at 127,139 st.\\nFor the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year through April, US urea imports were 7.23 million st (6.56 million mt) versus 6.61 million st (6 million mt) for the prior year period. Key subscribers for July-April of this year included Qatar at 1.42 million st, China at 1.37 million st and Canada at 798,691 st. While the year- over-year totals still show a significant surge in US imports this year, the April shortfall and long-held anecdotal views that the US needed to make up for a severely depleted supply chain at the start of the fertilizer year suggest that US supplies are relatively snug given typical spring demand.\\nCanada: Urea imports and exports on the rise\\nCanadian exports of urea in April were up by 88.5% and January-April exports were lifted by 14.7%. January-April imports were up by 36%.\\nApril exports of 142,000 mt were destined almost exclusively to the US, as was the January-April volume of 401,000 mt.\\nApril imports of 104,000 mt were up by 10.2% on April 2014. The US accounted for 42,000 mt, down by 8.7%, while deliveries from Russia of 28,500 mt were up by 59%.\\nJanuary-April imports of 281,000 mt were up by 36% on 2014, but arrivals from the US of 98,000 mt were off by 6.9%. Germany accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 53% while arrivals of 32,000 mt from Bahrain lifted imports from that nation from zero in the prior year. Russia accounted for 31,000 mt, Qatar for 21,000 mt, UAE for 19,000 mt and Kuwait for 17,000 mt.\\nUS NOLA: Trades and prices pick up\\nThe high end of the granular urea barge market started the week and generally held at $345-348/st FOB, but prompt barges also traded as low as $335/st FOB. Offers for 2H June barges were as high as $340/st FOB, but most trades occured at $316-320/st FOB. Forward business for 1H July is substantially discounted at $305/st FOB.\\nMeanwhile, full tows will not be able to move up the Arkansas River to Tulsa Oklahoma for as long as two weeks while flood waters ease.\\nThere are reports that EuroChem\\'s June cargo that was due in the Gulf June 11 now will not reach the Southwest Pass to the Mississippi River until June 16. A Koch cargo out of Oman previously expected in the first half of this month now appears likely to discharge at the end of the month. Finally, traders report CF Industries temporarily stopped making new truck sales out of Donaldsonville Louisiana plant this week in order to catch up on its barge commitments, but the company has not posted any news relating to the rumor.\\nMexico: Interest in prilled and granular urea\\nMexican importers indicate interest in additional volumes of granular urea for the West Coast (WCM) and there is also open interest in prills for the East Coast (ECM).\\nIndications from buyers for WCM granular are around $325/mt CFR, but importers appear in no hurry to cover, citing prospects of further price-concessions in coming weeks. Offers are well above $330/mt CFR despite the slight weakening in recent netbacks to Chinese producers.\\nImporters of prills for ECM are yet to concede demands from sellers of prills from the FSU based on FOB values from the Baltic and the Black Sea in the upper $290s/mt FOB and are aiming some $15/mt below indications around the $320/mt CFR marker.\\nMexican imports of urea in March were up by a full 125% to 120,000 mt. Chinese product accounted for 58,000 mt, up from zero in March 2014. Deliveries from Russia of 49,000 mt were up by 5% to 49,000 mt.\\nQ1 imports of 215,500 mt were nevertheless only up by 8% on the prior year, but imports from China registered an increase of 254% to reach 119,000 mt. Arrivals from Russia were down by 34.4% to 82,000 mt and shipments from Qatar were down to zero from 33,000 mt in Q1 2014.\\nUS Midwest/N Plains: Retailers travel farther for urea\\nGranular urea is in tight supply from the Dakotas to Illinois, although pricing has only moved modestly higher in recent days. Buyers in the Dakotas have been willing to shop for truckloads from Missouri and Iowa rather than risk delays possible when ordering by rail. As a result business in the last few days in the Dakotas has occured up to $400/st DEL this week, up $5/st from last week\\'s high. On the other hand warehouse pricing in Iowa and Minnesota continues at $370-375/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nPeru: Urea imports through Q1 up significantly\\nPeruvian imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS in the first quarter of 2015 of 119,000 mt were up by 86.6% following a massive increase of 262% to 63,600 mt in the month of March. Deliveries in March from China of 43,400 mt were up from zero in March 2014 while Russian arrivals of 20,200 mt were up by 15%.\\nChina also dominated Q1 imports with deliveries of 70,200 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. Arrivals from Russia were however down by 26% in the quarter, to 48,200 mt.\\nColombia: Imports of urea down significantly in Q1\\nImports of urea by Colombia as identified by customs via GTIS in March were down by 22.6% on March 2014 to 24,400 mt. This brought the Q1 total to 71,000 mt, down by 35.4% on the prior year.\\nThe imports in March and in the first quarter of the year were about equally split between supplies from China and Venezuela.\\nRenewed interest in imports of granular urea emerged this week for a cargo in combination with a requirement in El Salvador. Indications from sellers for Chinese product in the upper $330s/mt CFR for two ports on the west coast did not elicit significant buying interest.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nUkraine: Urea exports continue to trail prior years\\nExports of urea from Ukraine continue to suffer from cutbacks in output from Group DF units and the overall instability in the country. March exports identified by customs via GTIS of 168,600 mt were down by 16% on March 2014, and Q1 exports of 436,000 mt were down by 13.9%.\\nMarch shipments of 85,000 mt to Turkey were down by 24%, but the 25,000 mt loaded for Spain was up from zero in March 2014. Shipments to Italy of 17,600 mt were off by 51%.\\nTurkey accounted fror 209,000 mt out of the Q1 volume, up by 9.5% on Q1 2014. Shipments to Spain were up from 6,600 mt to 59,000 mt while deliveries to Italy were down by 25.3% to 58,000 mt.\\nBlack Sea: Prilled price up on NF purchase\\nTrading in prilled urea remains limited out of the Black Sea, mainly on limited availability following the closure of the Group DF plants, as reported last week. The cut in Cherkassy output triggered a purchase by NF Trading this week from a trader at a suggested $298/mt FOB Yuzhnyy for 25,000 mt to load for Italy mid- June to cover prior commitments via NF Italia originally planned to load from own production.\\nThe price indicated is viewed with some scepticism in the trade, given offers in the beginning of the week some $4-5/mt lower.\\nShipments from Yuzhnyy/TIS in May worked out marginally above 146,000 mt and the lineup for June is so far limited to about 14,000 mt loading on the Abdullatif (11,000 mt for Keytrade) and the C. Pioneer (3,300 mt for Wittraco).\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Some more forward interest for July, August\\nSuppliers of granular urea to France for forward positions suggest that trades for July and August delivery have been concluded in the low €320s/mt FCA this week. Buyers still contend that cover for August can be obtained below €300/mt FCA.\\nThe prompt market is void of activity, and is therefore assessed at par with last week around the €325/mt FCA marker. This implies a delivered value around $350/mt CFR into the French Bay given the stronger euro in recent days, suggesting netbacks to Egyptian producers below $315/mt FOB for an intermediary to generate a margin. Sales of July posititions would provide producers with returns around $310/mt FOB if loaded from Egypt.\\nTurkey: Q1 2015 imports below 2014\\nTurkish importers of urea for direct application are largely holding off on purchases due to the higher values perceived for Black Sea material following the closure of Group DF output of urea. Open interest is essentially limited to industrial users such as Kastamonu that tenders June 4 for 3,500 mt for June delivery.\\nTurkish imports of urea in Q1 2015 as identified by customs via GTIS of 356,000 mt were meanwile off by 5.5% on the first quarter of 2014. This despite March imports of 152,000 mt that were up by 9% on the prior year.\\nMarch imports from Ukraine of 81,000 mt were up by 23% on March 2014 and deliveries from Iran of 40,500 mt were up by 266%. Arrivals from Russia were down by 66% to 15,000 mt and China accounted for 12,000 mt.\\nQ1 arrivals from Ukraine of 175,000 mt were up by 19% and deliveries from Iran of 105,000 mt were up by a full 471%. China accounted for 34,300 mt, up from 1,600 in Q1 in 2014. Shipments of 15,000 mt from Russia were down by 89.6% and arrivals from Romania of 9,500 mt were down by 68% compared to Q1 2014.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Offers available despite cuts\\nTraders suggest that indications of availability of granular urea around the $320/mt FOB marker are available from Egyptian producers despite continuing cuts in output due to erratic supply of natural gas.\\nLimited prompt trades in granular urea are reported in key European outlets, but indications of interest in forward positions in France and Mediterranean markets would provide sellers with returns around $310- 315/mt FOB for cargoes loading in June when allowing for storage plus financing costs.\\nAlgeria: Sorfert to restore urea output shortly\\nAlgerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nThe producer completed loading of 15 vessels in May for contract-holders Helm, Indagro, Keytrade, OCI, Trammo and Ameropa for a total close to 100,000 mt despite the outage and the force majeure declaration that ensued. Indagro was in the freight market this week for a vessel to load 25,000 mt for the US Gulf in June 6-8 laydays from Arzew.\\nOperations at the first 1.3 million mt/year AOA granular urea line are reported regular with additional nominations made for carriers to load for Europe and Brazil.\\nMiddle East: Producers still bullish on limited supply\\nMiddle East producers cite limited availability for the next 30-45 days in support of quotes for sales outside contract commitments around $315/mt FOB despite lower bids from traders.\\nReturns on open business in key spot markets such as Brazil are yet to exceed $305/mt FOB, and Brazilian buyers appear in no hurry to secure additional tonnage given inbound carriers with unsold quantities on board.\\nDespite the rebound in US spot prices this week, forward barge values at New Orleans that would apply for vessels arriving in about two weeks around an even $320/st FOB are indicative of delivered values of $346/mt CFR, suggesting producer netbacks after deduction of freight and transaction charges marginally above $320/mt FOB. End-June/early July trades around $305/st FOB New Orleans reflect returns at $305/mt FOB Middle East.\\nFirm offers in paper markets for full July positions from the Middle East were posted June 4 at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $295/mt FOB against bids at $285/mt FOB.\\nEgypt: Natural gas shortages reflected in exports\\nShortages of natural gas continue to impact urea exports from Egypt identitified by customs via GTIS, with the Q1 2015 volume down by a full 80% on 2014 to 154,000 mt. March exports of 37,500 mt were down by\\n84% with deliveries to France cut by 80% to 34,000 mt. Shipments to Greece of 2,600 mt were down by 88%.\\nQ1 shipments to France of 93,500 were off by 79.2% while cargoes loaded from Italy totaling 19,500 mt were down by 86%, and shipments to Greece dropped by 62.3% to 19,000 mt. Deliveries to Spain were down from 64,000 mt to 2,000 mt.\\nSouth Africa: Urea imports through April down on 2014\\nSouth African imports of urea identified by customs via GTIS from January through April of 99,300 mt were down by 36.1% on the same period in 2014.\\nQatar accounted for 61,600 mt, down by 13.7% on the prior year while deliveries from Saudi Arabia of 28,000 mt were off by 58%. Shipments from the UAE of 7,200 mt were up from zero in the same period in 2014.\\nApril imports of 25,000 mt were mainly sourced from Qatar, and were down by 49.3% on on April 2014.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: GTIS identifies March imports at 729,000 mt\\nIndian imports of urea in March as identified by customs via GTIS of 729,000 mt were up by 248% on March 2014. This lifted Q1 imports to 2.34 million mt, up by 144% on Q1 2014.\\nMarch imports from China of 438,000 mt were up sharply on the 38,000 mt imported in March 2014 and imports from OMIFCO in Oman of 314,000 mt were up by 33% on the prior year. Imports from Iran in March 2015 of 75,000 mt were up from zero in March 2014.\\nChina accounted for 1.72 million mt of the 2.34 million imported in Q1, up by 335% on the prior year. Deliveries from Oman were up by 5.25% to 522,000 mt and shipments from Iran totaled 75,000 mt. Provisional data from the Fertilizer Association of India for April imports as posted in the May 20 update suggested a 872,000 mt volume.\\nA May 27 statement issued by the Indian Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers contended that supply of urea for Kharif is \"adequate and comfortable\", citing an increase in imports of 1 million mt and a similar increase in domestic output. A follow-up tender to secure cover to complement the relatively limited tonnage prodcured via the April 10 STC tender and the May 9 IPL session is nevertheless expected early June to make up for the estimated shortfall in availability for Kharif.\\nPakistan: TCP awards Dreymoor and Samsung\\nPakistani importer TCP has issued Letters of Intent to Dreymoor and Samsung at the prices offered by the traders in the May 29 and June 1 tenders, respectively.\\nDreymoor was awarded the 50,000 mt in the May 29 session at $318.63/mt CFR while Samsung took the 50,000 mt in the June 1 tender at $318.53/mt CFR.\\nTCP has yet to receive final instructions to proceed with tenders to cover the 150,000 mt urea approved by the ECC for import pursuant to the awards made in the above tenders, but is expected to float three sessions for 50,000 mt each at the end of June/early July.\\nPakistan: June 1 TCP tender attracts 13 offers\\nThe June 1 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from 13 suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.\\nSamsung reduced its $319.92/mt CFR price in the May 29 session to $318.53/mt CFR and was the lowest in the June 1 tender. Dreymoor was second June 1 at $318.54/mt CFR, followed by Liven at $325.38/mt CFR and by Ameropa at $327.43/mt CFR. Transglobe was at $329.21/mt CFR, Swiss at $329.43/mt CFR, Indagro at $329.74/mt CFR, and Quantum at $329.75/mt CFR. Keytrade, Daewoo, Fertisul, CHS and Trammo were all above $330/mt CFR.\\nThe Samsung offer was down by a mere $0.10/mt on the winning Dreymoor offer in the May 29 tender.\\nPakistan: May 29 TCP tender attracts eight offers\\nThe May 29 TCP tender for 50,000 mt prilled or granular urea for prompt shipment attracted offers from eight suppliers, each offering the full tonnage.\\nDreymoor submitted the lowest offer at $318.63/mt CFR, followed by Samsung at $319.92/mt CFR and by Keytrade at $332.50/mt CFR. Ameropa was at $332.76/mt CFR, Quantum at $332.90/mt CFR, Liven at $334.38/mt CFR, Transglobe at $334.50/mt CFR and CHS at $338.37/mt CFR.\\nThe Dreymoor offer reflected a netback to the trader marginally below $300/mt FOB from China basis freight for a large carrier on TCP terms estimated at $15-17/mt and transaction costs including L/C confirmation charges around $3/mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nMalaysia: Mixed signals in exports through February\\nMalaysian February urea exports identified by customs via GTIS of 100,000 mt were off by about 12% on February 2014, but the January- February volume of 187,000 mt was up by 9% on the first two months of 2014.\\nFebruary exports to the Philippines were up by 114% to 39,500 mt while deliveries to the US of 30,000 mt were off by about 50% on the prior year.\\nThe Philippines accounted for 92,000 mt of the 187,000 mt shipped in January-February, up by 196%, while\\nAustralia went from zero to 33,000 mtin the two months. Shipments to the US\\nwere off by 50% per the above while deliveries to Thailand of 15,000 mt were down by 68% on the prior year.\\nThailand: Urea imports up in April, Saudis supply bulk\\nTrade in granular urea in Thailand remains subdued due to the wide spread in price ideas tabled by sellers and buyers. Quotes in the mid- $330s/mt CFR are countered around an even $320/mt CFR, at best, and importers appear content to wait for price-concessions from suppliers.\\nA trader is in the freight market for a vessel to load 25,000 mt granular urea from Tianjin or Jinzhou in China to Bangkok/Kohsichang in June 10-20 laydays.\\nImports of urea by Thailand in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 207,400 mt were meanwhile up by 3.2% on April 2015. Saudi Arabia accounted for 103,000 mt, Qatar for 44,000 mt, Malaysia 31,000 mt and Oman for 22,000 mt.\\nJanuary-April imports of 551,000 mt were nevertheless off by about 14.6% on the first four months of 2014. Saudi Arabia remained the number one supplier with 251,000 mt, but that volume was down by 14.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Malaysia were up marginally to 97,000 mt while deliveries from Qatar of 89,000 mt were off by 19.6%. Shipments from Indonesia of 30,000 mt were up by 20% on the prior year.\\nChina: Offers for prilled urea up further for export\\nDomestic values for prilled and granular urea in China were largely in line with last week, but quotes for prills for export were up. Offers for prills for prompt export are at $305-308/mt FOB while quotes for regular Chinese quality granular were maintained marginally above the $310/mt FOB marker.\\nMainstream domestic trades in prilled urea at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) EXW in northern China were at par with last week. Trades were recorded in Shanxi at RMB 1,620/mt ($261/mt) FCA.\\nDomestic buyers are still competing for the prilled product with local traders buying for export as high as RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main ports, indicative of export values around $307/mt FOB plus provisions for margins to exporters.\\nDomestic values for granular urea for export were relatively flat at RMB 1,780-1,800/mt CPT northern ports, with the high end indicative of an export price at $315/mt FOB, also without provisions for margins. A 7,000 mt sale to Namhae in South Korea this week is however reported at a netback to the seller assessed around\\n$308/mt FOB. China Blue meanwhile indicated returns marginally above $315/mt FOB for its premium quality product.\\nThe softer tendency in regional export values for granular urea was also evident in the June 3 tender in Indonesia that attracted bids no higher than $302/mt FOB Bontang against the reserve set by Pupuk Kaltim at $325/mt FOB for the premium-quality grade. Kaltim has since adjusted its reserve to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders.\\nInventories in Chinese ports for export have increased on last week, but not substantially. Yantai inventory is assessed at 270,000 mt this week compared to 220,000 mt last week. The inventory consists of about 180,000 mt granular urea and 90,000 mt prills. Arrivals into the port have however slowed to about 5,000 mt/day from about 10,000 mt/day last week. Qingdao inventory is assessed at a mere 25,000 mt.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim scraps sales tender\\nPupuk Kaltim elected to scrap the June 3 tender for the sale of 60,000 mt granular urea for June lifting from Bontang. The producer had set the reserve (minimum) price for the tonnage at $325/mt FOB, but failed to attract bids close to that number.\\nThe highest bid received was from CHS at $302/mt FOB, with FertComm second at $300/mt FOB. These were down on the single bid at $305/mt FOB received by Kaltim in the May 22 tender for the sale of 30,000 mt that was also scrapped.\\nThe producer has since adjusted its reserve down to $313/mt FOB and is in discussions with traders. Production of ammonia at Kaltim V is meanwhile close to rated capacity and urea is running around 80% of capacity.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Chinese caprolactam grade product is on offer at $133-134/mt FOB for June shipment although not much business is reported concluded.\\nSteel grade AS supply squeezed by demand from NPK producers and reduced steel production, is now pegged in the high $120s/mt FOB.\\nBrazil keeps showing interest in Chinese AS with prices now quoted at $165-170/mt CFR, but deals have not been fixed. Accessing lines of credit has stalled potential purchases and despite the Brazilian government’s 2015/16 Harvest Plan outlining a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the agriculture support programme, there is not much optimism. Depressed demand is likely to continue considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at six month lows.\\nIn the Black Sea KuibyshevAzot sold 3-4,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for June shipment to AFT in the high $140s/mt FOB. The destination of the cargo was unknown at press time. Steel grade AS is reported available from Kherson at $135/mt FOB or above for July.\\nUAN\\nSales into France have been driving UAN market activity with a large volume of UAN-30 for summer fill secured by distributors at €193-194/mt FCA Rouen over the past week. Farmers are taking positions on much of this tonnage before prices rise further.\\nAbu Qir is thought to holding off issuing a new UAN-32 tender until market values move up further.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nThe June 3 OCI annnouncement of a €225/mt CIF price for Germany and Benelux and the €233/mt CIP price in France came as no big surpise given Yara\\'s May 26 drop in the price for CAN to the same number for June deliveries in Germany\\nExports of AN from the FSU remain limited, but the changes in credit availability announced in Brazil this week did offer some potential relief, even if the preferential interest rates announced were above most expectations in the country.\\nImporters in Turkey still cite offers for AN at attractive forward prices, but have yet to opt to purchase early rather than wait for the traditional summer lull. The cutbacks in Ukranian availabilty via the Group DF closures of output at Cherkassy and RivneAzot might however trigger additional purchasing interest.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barge demand should revive very soon\\nUAN-32 barges should be in greater demand in coming days. Ground conditions in the Midwest are improving, which should allow for more application work and allow for more in-season refill business. However, suppliers in the interior warn that their retail customers are looking for lower prices on new spot business. This may lead to further reductions from the low end of last week\\'s barge range of $230/st FOB New Orleans.\\nUS: UAN imports still surpassing prior year figures\\nUAN imports to the US during April were down modestly from one year earlier, at 253,400 st (229,883 mt) versus 281,339 st (255,229 mt), but for the first 10 months of the US fertilizer year, imports continued well ahead of the prior year at 3.07 million st (2.78 million mt).\\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, the major suppliers of UAN to the US during April were Trinidad and Tobago at 75,533 st, Canada at 55,000 st and Russia at 60,794 st. Most of the decline in the April 2015 arrivals versus April 2014 shows up in the Russian volumes, which fell from 146,646 st.\\nKey suppliers during July-April followed the historical trend led by Russia at 1.04 million st, Trinidad and Tobago at 688,161 st and Canada at 423,347 st.\\nUS Midwest: UAN applications return this week\\nUAN demand is substantial in the Midwest, especially in Illinois and Indiana. Retailers are finding spot outages as they respond to farmers\\' efforts to apply UAN on corn fields that have begun to dry out after frequent rain over the prior month. Spot values are unchanged from prior weeks, as substantial volumes of pre-paid UAN still are arriving, and distributors said they are not confident that they can raise prices for UAN from recent quotes of $9.22-9.63/unit FOB.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Distributors buying more summer fill UAN-30\\nA large volume of UAN-30 for summer fill has been secured by distributors at €193-194/mt FCA Rouen over the past week. Farmers are stepping in and taking positions on much of this tonnage as prices are expected to edge up further in the coming days.\\nGiven such large sales, it is possible that buyers now can hold back from securing much more product in the following weeks especially if prices continue edging upwards.\\nAS\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyer interest in AS maintained and prices up\\nBrazilian interest in AS is maintained although no large deals are reported concluded. Prices are now quoted at $165-170/mt CFR.\\nAs reported last week, low corn prices and difficulties getting credit in the country have stalled potential purchases. The Brazilian government’s 2015/16 Harvest Plan revealed June 3 outlined a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the agriculture support programme to R$187.7 billion, but it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing. Depressed demand is likely to remain considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at six month lows.\\nSafrinha corn harvesting has begun and early yield indications have been excellent. This will continue to pressure corn prices, with farmer selling said to be very slow, another downside for AS demand.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Russia\\'s KuibyshevAzot books AS sale\\nKuibyshevAzot is linked to the sale of 3-4,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for June shipment to AFT in the high $140s/mt FOB. The destination of the cargo was unknown at press time.\\nSteel grade AS is reported available from Kherson at $135/mt FOB or above for July.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: AS shipments continue formidable growth\\nChinese ammonium sulphate (AS) exports for April 2015 grew by almost 100% year-on year at 550,503 mt, prompted by a substantial leap in demand from Indonesia.\\nShipments to Indonesia reached 204,641 mt in April, an increase of 348% on the previous year owing to a number of tenders.\\nExports of AS to the US during that same month grew to 44,990 mt compared with zero in 2014.\\nTotal Chinese AS shipments for January-April reached 1.6 million mt, up 39.6% on the previous year.\\nDemand continues to be strong into June with Brazilian importers expected to ship in greater quantities.\\nChinese caprolactam grade AS prices are quoted at $133-134/mt FOB for June shipment. Steel grade product is now pegged in the high $120s/mt FOB due to demand from buyers running compaction units and reduced Chinese steel output.\\nAN\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyers still hold off on AN procurement\\nBrazilian buyers are in no hurry to venture into new purchases of AN following deals up to an even $225/mt CFR, and have rejected proposals from suppliers above $235/mt CFR without countering.\\nCAN\\nEUROPE\\nNW Europe: OCI posts CAN in line with Yara\\nOCI posted summer deliveries of CAN in Germany, Benelux and France this week in line with the May 26 Yara posting applicable for June deliveries. The producer priced June deliveries of CAN in Germany and Benelux at €225/mt CIF inland ports and posted deliveries in France at €233/mt CIP, effective immediately. A monthly increase of €5/mt will apply on all prices for July and August, respectively.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The scenario appears unlikely to change over the coming month.\\nMost market activity continues to centre on the Black Sea as Trammo mopped up 40,000 mt from suppliers OPZ, NF Trading and DniproAzot for use against business in Turkey and Israel. The trader reports deals were fixed above $390/mt FOB, although its recent reported 7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas was said to provide Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.\\nOn-going US supply disruptions are likely the reason Koch secured an additional 40,000 mt Yuzhnny tonnes from OPZ and Ameropa for loading on the Jenny N at the end of June. These tonnes were suggested secured around the $390/mt FOB mark or marginally below.\\nDownward price pressure on such values remains as OCP continues to push for prices below $400/mt CFR for July. The buyer claims its tanks are more or less full and is in no hurry to buy additional tonnage. Tunisian demand is still limited owing to recent strikes and the suspension of phosphates fertilizers output. There are initial signs that production may gradually to normal thereby stimulating additional ammonia demand, but this may take another month at least.\\nEast of Suez, stability also reigns, with sales by Sabic to Mitsui and Fertil to Trammo concluded within the current Middle East range keeping the market balanced. Both cargoes will likely be used against contract commitments in Asia given regional buyers’ overall lack of interest in spot tonnage. This is much the same situation for Marubeni after securing 15,000 mt from Malaysia’s Petronas, with the parcel being used for contract deliveries in Japan and South Korea despite attempts to conclude a spot deal.\\nIndian ammonia demand continues to provide little cheer for suppliers although prices remain stable at $415- 450/mt CFR. Spot demand is virtually non-existent except for a small parcel sold to Tata Chemicals by Trammo at the high end of the range.\\nThe outlook is more positive in the US where Mosaic intends to run at high rates through the summer and should not have any reason to cut its ammonia consumption. It has recently lowered one of its key indicators for the US domestic DAP market and continues to be content to follow the lead of other suppliers overseas.\\nDomestic US ammonia consumption appears to be meeting expectations, based on anecdotal reports. Inland ammonia values are creeping down though, likely influenced by wet weather that may cut into ammonia\\'s side-dress business for the US corn crop.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Trammo buys 40,000 mt ex-Yuzhnny above $390/mt FOB\\n∙Koch buys 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa around $390/mt FOB\\n∙Trammo sells 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR\\n∙Fertil sells 10-15,000 mt to Trammo within publish Middle East range\\n∙Mitsui secures 23,000 mt from Sabic under formula pricing\\n∙Trammo sells under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals around $450/mt CFR\\n∙Marubeni buys 15,000 mt from Petronas under formula pricing\\nShort term outlook\\nValues are set to remain flat on regular supply and buying.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nWith MAP shipments to Brazil taking priority this month out of Morocco plus a good line up of DAP and MAP into Europe, demand for ammonia should remain solid through June. A similar trend is expected for July with MAP and DAP expected to remain the dominant products once more. Renewed demand should start to surface from Tunisia as rock supplies to the downstream plants are resumed and GCT strives to meet potential DAP commitments in Turkey and southern Europe for June shipment onwards.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Bearish DAP signals weigh on ammonia\\nSummer pricing for US domestic DAP and MAP may well fuel Mosaic and other US phosphate producers\\' determination to hold the line on ammonia costs, and perhaps even pursue a cheaper deal for July in coming weeks. Mosaic is maintaining an aggressive price stance in order to continue selling into the domestic and Latin American markets in coming weeks, and it may expect its ammonia suppliers to support that program with a reduction in the current $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.\\nUS: April imports gain thanks to FSU cargoes\\nUS ammonia arrivals in April increased marginally to 564,287 st (511,918 mt) from 515,269 st (467,449 mt) one year earlier, as FSU cargos more than made up for a decline in discharges from Trinidad and Tobago.\\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, April supplies included 359,341 st from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 368,802 st during April 2014. On the other hand imports from the FSU jumped to 88,025 st from 44,063 st over the same months. Another key supplier in April of this year was Canada at 98,261 st.\\nThe April volume brought US imports during the first 10 months of its fertilizer year to 4.87 million st (4.41 million mt). The largest ammonia suppliers to the US during July-April remain Trinidad and Tobago at 3.2 million st, Canada at 933,878 st and the FSU at 437,137 st.\\nUS Midwest: Slightly lower price tag for side-dress use\\nMidwest distributors have been more aggressive with ammonia pricing in recent days, with quotes around $600/st FOB from inland terminals east of the Mississippi River and indications cloer to $590/st FOB from terminals along the upper river system and rail quotes from the Dakotas to Iowa. Much of the corn ground still was drying out on both sides of the Mississippi River this week, but warm and dry winds increased optimism that ammonia side-dress applications would restart by the end of the week.\\nUS California: Drought remains a drag on sales\\nAmmonia in California is down at least $20/st from prior weeks, but weaker indications are unlikely to drive trade. The state continues to suffer from a three-year drought. While the state\\'s farm output and fertilizer consumption exceeded expectations despite the lack of rain, suppliers believe farming will inceasingly be limited to areas that can tap into deep wells. Farmers that rely on rainfall will be able to do less and less, further limiting the need for ammonia and other products. Recent quotes for ammonia are cited around $570- 580/st DEL.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Trammo and Koch busy once again\\nTrammo has secured 40,000 mt from Black Sea suppliers NF Trading, OPZ and DnieproAzot, suggested above $390/mt FOB. The tonnage will be lifted on the Marycam Swan and Touraine this month against business in Turkey and Israel.\\nTrammo’s recent 6-7,000 mt sale to Turkey’s Bagfas for mid-June delivery reportedly provides Black Sea netbacks nearer $380-385/mt FOB.\\nKoch secured a further 40,000 mt from OPZ and Ameropa to load June 20-25 on the Jenny N, also suggested fixed at $390/mt FOB or marginally below. Early indications are that the vessel will head to the US given on-going reports of production issues at Koch’s US facilities.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Trammo sells another cargo to Bagfas\\nTrammo is linked to the sale of 6-7,000 mt to Bagfas at $413/mt CFR for mid June delivery this week, reflecting a slight weakening in values. Trammo will use the Sylvie which has finished loading in Rouen for the transaction\\nPetkim said it will likely issue an enquiry for 6,000 mt spot cargo at the end of June for mid July delivery.\\nGemlik, meanwhile, has no ammonia available for export at present with all plants running well.\\nToros and Trammo have signed a five year ammonia supply agreement, formalizing their existing relationship. Trammo will supply ammonia to Toros across the producer\\'s sites in Samsun, Ceyhan and Mersin over the five years on a regular basis for the majority of Toros\\' annual requirement.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Sorfert I ammonia and urea units back up soon\\nAlgerian producer Sorfert indicated it expects its Sorfert I ammonia and urea plants back up to commercial output shortly. The units were shut down May 17 due to technical problems.\\nTunisia: Recovery in fertilizer production continues\\nAmeropa confirmed it will be directing either the Gas Cobia or Gas Manta with 23,000 mt to Tunisia this month as AN production continues.\\nThere was further optimism this week that Tunisian fertilizer output is slowly getting back on track. Phosphate rock production at the Kef Eddour mine has resumed and phosphate rock will then be supplied to the downstream plants. This will in turn boost ammonia demand.\\nMorocco: Imports up as OCP takes another NF cargo\\nMoroccan ammonia imports for March 2015 at 61,623 mt ran 8.7% ahead of the same time last year, prompted by low ammonia values and greater tank storage capacity.\\nYear-to-date figures are up 7% at 219,359 mt helped by a strong import month in February.\\nThis year has seen OCP diversify its ammonia supply sources with product arriving from the Black Sea and Algeria. It has also secured ammonia directly from Black Sea suppliers such as NF Trading and chartered vessels from traders to bring the cargo to Jorf Lasfar.\\nThe Gaschem Stade is expected back in Yuzhnny June 9 to load another 23,000 mt Rossosh material for OCP with the buyer claiming the deal was was struck around $400/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by the supplier.\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic concludes another spot deal\\nSabic has sold 23,000 mt to Mitsui under a formula pricing arrangement for mid July loading. The vessel has not yet been nominated but ther cargo will be directed to the Far East for use against Mitsui\\'s contract commitments in the region.\\nUAE: Fertil books ammonia sale with Trammo\\nFertil has sold 10-15,000 mt ammonia to Trammo within the current Middle East index range. The cargo will be lifted in July on the Brussels against contract business in the Far East.\\nIts 760,000 mt/year Fertil I urea line and the 430,000 mt/year ammonia line were shut down last month for maintenance and were due to restart at the end of May. This has now been pushed back to June 9-10.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: No improvement in demand, and prices stable\\nIndian ammonia demand remains lacklustre and prices are still pegged at $415-450/mt CFR.\\nTrammo said it sold under 7,000 mt to Tata Chemicals for prompt delivery to Haldia off the Tobolsk at the high end of the Indian index price.\\nIFFCO is set to receive a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars at the end of June.\\nIndia: FACT issues ammonia tender closing June 5\\nFACT has issued a new ammonia import tender for 7,500 mt closing June 5. Shipment is requested 26-30 June Cochin.\\nThis follows the scrapping of its May 11 tender for 2x7,500 mt due to high priced offers. The buyer said it is seeking offers in the low $400s/mt CFR in the latest session.\\nFACT had hoped to restart its Udyogamandal ammonia facility this month but this has now been postponed until June 1.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nMalaysia: Marubeni secures Petronas cargo\\nMarubeni is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt Petronas cargo for July lifting on the Bunga Kemboja under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo will likely be used against contract commitments in the Far East.\\nLast week Koch bought a 16,000 mt Petronas ammonia cargo for June lifting on the Bunga Kemobja, also under a formula pricing arrangement. The cargo is to be used against Koch’s contract with SFC in Korea.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae pushes back spot ideas to September\\nNamhae had now fixed its contract delivery schedule up to the first half of August and will likely push back any enquiries for tonnage outside contract volumes to September.\\nAround 8,000 mt will be discharged in Ulsan next week by Mitsubishi off the Sanko Innovator, followed by a 15,000 mt parcel from Yara off the Nordic River that was recently secured under a spot deal at $433/mt CFR.\\nSentiment that prices may weaken further in the region owing to poor industrial demand remains, although Middle East buyers contend prices should firm in response to limited spot cargo availability.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Initial reactions were positive but delving a little deeper it would appear that the terms offered are perhaps not as favourable as initially thought leavign market sentiment little changed. Although volumes are now moving with a steady stream of Chinese lower grade cargoes continuing to load through June and some 230,000 mt confirmed sold out of Morocco, it may do little to lift the general malaise pervading the market.\\nIn India the sentiment is no better with this week seeing the rupee fall to INR 64 against the US dollar, the IMD revising its monsoon forecast down further and a five day delay in the start of rainy season all combining to place further pressure on prices going forward. Suppliers meanwhile citing demand from other Asian markets, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as potential alternatives in South America are looking to either maintain price levels, as in the case of China or else seek an increase.\\nThere is still the potential for further price increases in the short term if demand in Brazil picks up for June/July creating a temproary tightness in supply with a short window still a concern. For the Indian market only a reversal in the rupee\\'s fortunes can feasibly drive the price upwards. At current exchange rates and an MRP of INR 24,000/mt, a price of $480/mt CFR barely gives a margin of 1% and this does not take into account any additional cost of hedging or interest payments. Therefore attempts by Saudi suppliers to move the price to $490/mt CFR will be strongly resisted by importers not wishing to see their already frail margins disappear altogther.\\nWhile earlier indications for US DAP fill numbers were as high as $440/st FOB New Orleans, a sharp downturn this week and a $15/st lower indication for Central Florida railcars from Mosaic suggests cheaper options may be on their way. Mosaic has tried to keep its Tampa and New Orleans price tags roughly in line in recent months, but that may prove difficult if prices in Brazil continue to gain. Spot sales by traders would put New Orleans about $9/mt below this week\\'s export range of $471-475/mt FOB Tampa.\\nMosaic\\'s aggresive stance on pricing has the desired effect of making potential imports over the summer look an increasingly unattractive proposition. Having said that, OCP is still planning an 80,000 mt vessel in July even though landed prices into the US, based on current prices, equate to the low $450s/mt CFR US Gulf. For Chinese suppliers, even the lower prices being indicated in India offer a more tempting alternative to the US.\\nElsewhere attention has focussed on Bangladesh where this week\\'s private sector tender attracted offers totalling over 1.5 million mt DAP plus TSP. The DAP prices reportedly offered on a CFR price seem to bear little relation to the FOB prices being quoted by suppliers. If all the costs indicated are taken into account, the netbacks to China would be far below $450/mt FOB against suppliers\\' indications above $460/mt\\nFOB. Some clarity will emerge over the coming few days as final quantity allocations are confirmed and real price levels become clearer.\\nOn the supply side, more mines are resuming production in Tunisia but some disruptions to transport are still being reported.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙1.5 million mt DAP offered in Bangladesh tender; OCP to get largest TSP allocation\\n∙OCP sells additional 150,000 mt MAP into Brazil but at same price of $500/mt CFR\\n∙Saudi suppliers indicate higher prices in $490s/mt CFR for Indian sub-continent\\n∙US domestic prices weak after $15/st drop in Central Florida railcars\\n∙More mines re-opened in Tunisia\\nSulphur\\n∙Further signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphate demand and its likely effect on Chinese DAP exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.\\nAmmonia\\n∙The ammonia market is stable, supported by regular Black Sea buying from Trammo and Koch at around $390/mt FOB.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Boost to April DAP/MAP imports\\nUS DAP and MAP imports got a boost in April compared to one year ago, adding to the gains for the 10 months through April that saw substantial arrivals from China through the latter part of 2014.\\nApril DAP arrivals in the US were 216,973 st (196,837 mt), up from just 25,641 st (23,261 mt) one year earlier. Morocco discharged 158,689 st in the US in April, up from just 23,363 st one year earlier. Russian DAP accounted for 56,109 st versus almost nothing in April 2014.\\nFor the first 10 months of the fertilizer year through April, US DAP imports were 736,435 st (668,089 mt), up from 119,770 st (108,655 mt) in April 2014.\\nAlmost all of the gains came from the two largest suppliers to the US during the current fertilizer year. While most of its tons arrived in Q3 and Q4, China emerged as the second largest DAP supplier to the US at 282,936 st (255,678 mt), up from a paltry 903 st (844 mt) during the prior year period. Morocco raised its July-April US deliveries to 383,649 st (348,044 mt) from 254,384 st (230,776 mt) a year earlier.\\nMAP imports in April were just 66,409 st (60,246 mt), down moderately from 72,541 st (65,809 mt). Russia at 38,528 st and Morocco at 24,211 st accounted for the bulk of the April MAP arrivals.\\nThe first 10 months of the current US fertilizer year through April saw MAP imports remain well ahead of the prior year period. China at 254,227 st versus 2,643 st over the relevant months and Russia at 308,530 st versus 156,593 st accounted for most of the year-on-year gains. The other key MAP supplier to the US this year was Morocco with 383,649 st.\\nUS NOLA: DAP falls on lack of interest\\nDAP barge values moved down this week, as efforts by traders to find buyers at $420/st FOB apparently failed, although many market players predicted new business could be completed near that level.\\nAt this stage there is very little need for further prompt barges in most major domestic markets. Reports of summer cargoes from Morocco and elsewhere are not believed by all, but they are weighing on traders\\' price ideas.\\nAt least one major trader is offering a consignment programme to domestic distributors basis open-origin DAP/MAP. It is not clear how popular such a programme would be versus a flat price programme, as inland distributors would have to give up DAP storage capacity with little certainty about their costs.\\nUS Midwest: Modest DAP demand remains\\nThe wet weather has delayed some phosphate applications, primarily for soybeans, according to regional distributors. In addition, hay cutting will pick up shortly, allowing for further phosphate applications on that\\ncrop. Nevertheless, the bulk of the seasonal sales are over and distributors are sitting on their hands with regard to summer fill for now.\\nMarket sources do report some consignment offers from traders offering open-origin DAP/MAP for delivery over the summer, but it is unclear whether this has attracted substantial interest. Prior spot DAP sales in the region occured around $460/st FOB.\\nUS Gulf: Mosaic more aggressive at home and abroad\\nBusiness reported by Mosaic this week shows the producer getting more aggressive with its domestic and overseas pricing. The company reported Central Florida rail pricing down $15/st June 3 from prior weeks to $430/st FOB.\\nAt the same time the company reported 38,000 mt of DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials sales to South American markets for July shipment, including a cargo understood to be destined for Argentina. The price tag for the DAP/MAP was cited at $471-475/mt FOB Tampa, with the low end of the range $3/mt under late- May sales by Mosaic.\\nThis would give a equivalent price range of $487-491/mt CFR for sales into Brazil, some $10/mt below the latest round of Moroccan MAP sales for June and well below recent price indications circulating in the marketplace of between $495-500/mt CFR Brazil.\\nUS S Plains: Phosphates done ahead of flooding\\nFlooding that has prevented field work across much of the Southern Plains is easing, but most of the season\\'s phosphate applications were completed prior to this week. Quotes for DAP are unchanged from Arkansas River terminals at around $460/st FOB.\\nMexico: Fertinal comfortable through June/July\\nFertinal will load 35-40,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP this month with the balance of June\\'s production directed into the local market. In July a second Chilean combination cargo will load. The balance of July\\'s production will either go to Bangladesh in the form of 30,000 mt TSP or most probably for shipment to the US.\\nThe TSP cargo offered into Bangladesh through Helm this week has been theoretically disqualified as Mexico is not included in the list of approved suppliers. The tonnes were offered at the most competitive price in the tender, at $455/mt CFR with bags and bagging. There remains an outside chance that the offer could be re-instated although at presstime no such decision had been made known.\\nAs reported in Fertilizer Week on May 13, Fertinal has had some production limitations at the plant stemming from issues curtailing supplies from its the rock mine. It was therefore forced to come into the spot market for two Senegalese rock cargoes. The first cargo has been loaded and shipped with the second to follow imminently. Production at the Lazaro Cardenas plant has been running nearer 70% during this period, nearer 60-65,000 mt/month DAP/MAP TSP, but normal production is expected to be resumed by the end of this month.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: US DAP sold for June\\nThe US tonnes sold this week by Mosaic are believed to include a cargo of DAP for Argentina, sold around the $505/mt CFR level and giving a netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB Tampa.\\nRussian tonnes have been on offer at around $515/mt CFR but as with Brazil, there is some resistance to the higher numbers.\\nBrazil: Buyers resist paying above $500/mt CFR\\nSuppliers\\' attempts to achieve higher prices for June cargoes, above $500/mt CFR, have met with resistance. Both OCP and PhosAagro were quoting $510/mt CFR at the end of the IFA meeting last week in Istanbul, but OCP has since confirmed new sales at the old price of $500/mt CFR.\\nOCP has now sold a total of 230,000 mt MAP (including a small quantity of DAP) for June shipment, all at $500/mt CFR. The price range therefore remains unchanged for granular 11-52-0, at $495-500/mt CFR Brazil.\\nPrice levels for granular 10-50-0 in China are being indicated at around the $430/mt FOB level by suppliers which would equate to the high $450s and more but again this is meeting resistance from the buyers whose price ideas are still nearer the low-mid $450s/mt CFR. For the 11-44-0, the price range in China remains in the mid $370s/mt FOB with suppliers looking to achieve $380/mt FOB. However, buyers are again not keen to pay much above the low $400s/mt CFR level.\\nBrazil: Harvest Plan may not be as good as it looks\\nThe Brazilian government has finally released the details of the 2015/16 Harvest Plan. President Dilma Rousseff announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the support programme, to R$187.7 billion, termed a \\'generous surprise\\' by the Agriculture Minister Katia Abreu. While the overall level of support is deemed generous, it may not be entirely supportive for domestic fertilizer purchasing.\\nFarmers rely heavily on subsidised interest rates (production loans) to purchase fertilizers. Funding allocation for these loans has been upped 7.5% y-o-y, to R$94.5 billion. For medium sized producers, production loan interest rates have been set at 7.75%, while larger producers (who take a bulk of the funding) will see rates of 8.75%. These rates are close to market expectations. Last year interest rates were 6.5%. Most of the funding increase has gone towards loans that will be available at market interest rates which are around 17- 23%.\\nWhile the 20% funding increase may seem favourable on the surface, it is unlikely to provide any significant support to the already slow fertilizer buying. Brazilian delegates at the recent IFA conference voiced concerns over the availability of credit. While this announcement will provide some relief, depressed demand is likely to remain, considering higher interest rates, inflation and domestic corn prices which are at 6 month lows. Safrinha corn harvesting has begun and early yield indications have been excellent. This will continue to pressure corn prices, with farmer selling said to be very slow, another downside for fertilizer demand.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Q3 spot import demand to depend on Tunisia\\nTo date a total of between 200-250,000 mt DAP has been booked for arrival into Turkey during 2015. This represents between 50-60% of Turkey\\'s annual DAP requirement. Demand for imports going forward, for the balance of around 150-200,000 mt DAP, will very much depend on GCT\\'s ability to supply tonnes against any new contract with Gubretas.\\nProduction at the rock mines in Tunisia has now been resumed and downstream production will follow shortly suggesting that, all being well, GCT will start to supply DAP to Turkey from end June/beginning of July and continuing through Q3 and potentially into October as planned.\\nThe last two years have seen a contract agreed for 160-180,000 mt DAP between GCT\\nand Gubretas. Assuming a similar amount this year, a further 140-160,000 mt may be still oustanding, following the 18,000 mt shipped at the end of May. Prior to this latest stoppage, GCT was producing as much as 55-60,000 mt DAP per month at Gabes.\\nFurther spot demand for Turkey will be limited according to the eventual quantity shipped by GCT. Based on potential production rates through the coming months and other commitments in southern Europe, GCT might be expected to supply nearer 120,000 mt between July-October which would give an overall total for the year to date secured for Turkey of between 320-370,000 mt, not too far off its full requirement. Additional Jordanian DAP may still be required for southern Turkey.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Price indications in the $490s/mt CFR\\nSabic and Ma\\'aden have revised up their price ideas to the $490s/mt CFR for new business to the Indian sub-continent.\\nSabic claims to be sold out for June and is now quoting the $490s/mt CFR for July business. It is also offering MAP for South America and South Africa and reports a sale at $485/mt FOB for July shipment. It is quoting the $490s/mt CFR for DAP sales into both India and Pakistan. Buyers in India however continue to quote far lower numbers for new business citing weaker rupee and monsoon concern.\\nMa\\'aden is also quoting the same price for late June/early July shipment to Pakistan. The last sale booked out of Saudi Arabia was the Ma\\'aden sale to Pakarab, finalised at the IFA meeting for June shipment in the mid $480s/mt CFR giving a netback in the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK. Ma\\'aden will load a second cargo to Pakistan this month against an earlier sale to Engro in the mid-upper $480s/mt CFR.\\nMa\\'aden is also looking at potential MAP opportunities for June/July shipment.\\nMorocco: Brazilian buyers resist higher prices\\nOCP has now confirmed the sale of a total of 230,000 mt MAP, including a very small quantity of DAP, for June shipment into the Brazilian market all priced at $500/mt CFR. OCP had hoped for an increase to $510/mt CFR for the second tranche of June sales and had indicated as much last week but this was not achieved. There is clear resistance at $500/mt CFR on the part of buyers in Brazil.\\nEurope will provide the other major outlet for June tonnes following sales of 90,000 mt MAP and DAP into both West and East European markets. OCP claims $515/mt FOB on sales of DAP to Spain while the overall range of price is quoted between $505-515/mt CFR for June.\\nPrice levels therefore will remain essentially unchanged with Brazilian sales continuing to reflect the lower end of the range.\\nA further 25,000 mt NPKs plus some DAP have been sold into Western African markets this month including Ivory Coast and Benin, the latter market taking 12-24-12+boron. The domestic market will take around 30,000 mt DAP/NPKs, mostly DAP.\\nIn total this will amount to 345,000 mt DAP and around 30,000 mt NPKs.\\nNo US cargoes are planned for June but OCP is still aiming to ship an 80,000 mt cargo into the US market in July, split between PCS and Koch. A cargo for China is also planned for July but this may be pushed later in Q3.\\nOCP offered around 110,000 mt TSP in the recent private sector tender in Bangladesh for June-September shipment. It is anticipating getting awards totalling 75,000 mt at netbacks between $402-405/mt FOB Morocco. Additional tonnes could be placed but as yet final quantities have not yet been confirmed.\\nNegotiations will start for Q3 phosphoric acid contracts in two weeks.\\nTunisia: Rock production at Metlaoui resumed\\nFurther to last week\\'s report that CPG had resumed production at Kef Eddour, production has since also re- started at Metlaoui. Unions are reported to have agreed to halt the strikes and blockades to enable production to resume but on condition that talks will continue to resolve the situation in Gafsa, according to local press reports.\\nProduction at CPG\\'s other mines is being re-started gradually and rock supplies will be resumed to GCT\\'s downstream units accordingly. However reports from Tunisia itself indicate that the transport system remains an issue in Gafsa with sit-ins still being reported in key areas.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: DAP demand/supply balance update\\nA total of 300,000 mt DAP has been booked for arrival in 2015, around 25-30% of Pakistan\\'s annual import requirement. No new cargoes have been booked since the two confirmed in the last Fertilizer Week report, for Chawla and Pakarab, from Quantum/China and Ma\\'aden respectively.\\nEngro specifically has not booked any new DAP cargoes since the two booked and already reported prior to the IFA meeting. With five cargoes now scheduled to arrive in June, there is little interest in prompt tonnage and the next wave of volume buying is more likely to be for July shipment to cover any shortfall in August/September demand.\\nJuly-December represents the peak period for DAP off-take in Pakistan. As such, steady demand for imports can be expected from July onwards to cover the balance of import requirements for 2015 - estimated at around 500,000 mt for July-October shipment. Good domestic off-take from July onwards could prompt imports of up to 600,000 mt.\\nThe budget will be formally presented on June 5 but no policy changes are now expected that will adversely affect demand for DAP.\\nIn the meantime Ma\\'aden has revised its price ideas for Pakistan up to the $490s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment.\\nA round up of all sales booked to date is as follows:\\nIndia: New rupee, weak monsoon will weigh on price\\nThe renewed weakness in the rupee this week, falling to just above INR 64 against the US dollar (as at presstime), and the ever gloomier reports on this year\\'s monsoon will further concentrate importers\\' efforts to achieve a reduction in DAP prices for the next round of business.\\nAs such some buyers are now indicating price ideas even below $460/mt CFR while Chinese suppliers are still keen to maintain a level nearer the recent price level of $480/mt CFR. Sabic has even raised its price ideas to the $490s/mt CFR for new business into India for July. Nevertheless, the general feeling is that some concession will be made in the coming weeks, with a reduction of $5-7/mt.\\nCIL has meanwhile floated an enquiry for 35,000 mt DAP with a price idea of $470/mt CFR with 180 days credit.\\nOn June 2 the IMD issued its second long-range forecast for this year\\'s monsoon, revising it down further from its initial forecast of 93% of the long period average (LPA) to 88%. The northwest of India is predicted to be worst affected with just 85% of the LPA expected. This region takes in states like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, all the main DAP consuming states.\\nAt the same time the onset of the monsoon that traditionally hits the coast of Kerala on May 31 is now expected to be delayed by five days in turn delaying the start of the kharif off-take season for DAP by the farmers.\\nIndia: More than 2.2 million mt DAP booked\\nAn estimated 2.26 million mt DAP has been booked to date for the Indian market for the current fertilizer year as illustrated in the table below. Although the latest shipments are not priced, the level for these cargoes is in the region of high $470s-480/mt CFR for Chinese product, depending on supplier and the low $480s/mt CFR for non-Chinese.\\nIndia: DFPCL closes enquiry for 20-20-0+13S\\nDeepak Fertilizer closed an enquiry June 3 for 30,000 mt 20-20-0+13S and 10,000 mt AS for June shipment with offers to remain valid to June 8.\\nBangladesh: Latest update on private sector tender\\nFurther to the report of June 2 on the MoA\\'s private sector tender for 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP for shipment by September, the DAP will be sourced from China and Australia, as originally expected.\\nThe first 120,000 mt DAP, reportedly from Hubei Dongsheng, should be priced at a straight netback to the mid $450/smt FOB, according to the tabulation of offers. However the supplier has indicated a price of nearer $465/mt FOB.\\nMost of the lower offers for the Chinese DAP are priced in the $460s/mt FOB while the Australian DAP is understood to be priced at $475/mt FOB.\\nWith regard to the TSP, Helm\\'s offer of 30,000 mt Mexican TSP ex Fertinal submitted at the most competitive tabulated price of $455.00/mt CFR, was initially disqualified as it was not included in the MoA\\'s original list of approved suppliers.\\nAs it stands currently, the 200,000 mt TSP looks likely to be covered from OCP/Morocco, LCC/Lebanon, Salatka/Tunisia and Agropolichim/Bulgaria with FOB values back to Morocco in the low $400s/mt. The split would change accordingly if Mexican TSP were to be reinstated.\\nInitial awards will be made shortly with final quantity allocations to be finalised by early next week.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: DAP under pressure but MAP stays firm\\nLowest offers in this week’s tender in Bangladesh mostly equate to a netback in the low $460s/mt FOB. However, the lowest price offered by Hubei Dongsheng should theoretically give a straight netback to $455/mt FOB but this is said by the industry to be unreflective of the market today in China.\\nNevertheless, renewed pressure will start to weigh on prices in the Indian market with further rupee weakness this week combined with the IMD’s latest downgrade of this year’s monsoon. This has already led some importers to indicate numbers as low as the mid $450s/mt CFR. These two variable factors are expected to result in some correction in price going forward, possibly around $5-7/mt, which will impact Chinese FOB values accordingly.\\nFor MAP the market remains relatively strong with both local and export prices showing signs of firming. Good demand for NPKs this year, often running at a discount to DAP in the local market, has prompted steady demand for powdered MAP. Prices have firmed up by around RMB100/mt over the past couple of weeks as a result.\\nGranular MAP for export, have also remained very firm with suppliers pushing for an increase to $375/mt and even $380/mt FOB for 11-44-0 and to $430/mt FOB for 10-50-0. As yet these higher numbers are not yet being seen in delivered values into Brazil prompting some resistance amongst buyers. Availability will remain tight through June and intoe arly July but thereafter demand from Brazil will slow down significantly. Tonnes are needed by September and with a 40 day shipment period from China plus\\nexpected congestion of up to 30 days or even more in Brazilian ports, importers will not wish to risk product arriving too late.\\nVietnam: No interest in DAP as season draws to an end\\nThe current season for DAP is nearly over and buying activity is slowing down accordingly. Offers on the border are in the region of $470/mt CFR in bags. Trader offers through normal channels are closer $495/mt CFR but there is little interest at this level.\\nThe volume of DAP imported between January and April this year totalled just short of 250,000 mt, in line with last year. Demand in the last few weeks has been slow as pressures from the agricultural sector have weighed down on fertilizer market. Additional supplies have also been made available from the domestic industry.\\nto\\nthe\\nThe new production at Vinachem\\'s Lao Cai plant which started production in December is finally filtering through into the market and reflected in higher domestic output. Latest figures for April show an increase of over 50% in DAP production between January and April this year. The volume produced in April reflects a combined operating rate at the two DAP plants of around 80%.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Rock prices unchanged amid quality concerns\\nThe FOB prices of Egyptian phosphate rock remain largely unchanged since the start of the year and concern about the quality of rock supplies is understood to be hampering demand, according to a number of traders.\\nJust short of 130,000 mt is booked to arrive at Indian ports from Egypt between the end of May and June 10, on a total of four vessels.\\nFertilizer Week\\'s assessment of the rock price FOB bulk Egypt (60-68% BPL) is unchanged at $62-75/mt.\\nThe one recent highlight for Egypt has been the export of the country\\'s first higher-grade (32% P2O5/70% BPL) rock, drawn from stocks at the Red Sea Mine for April loading at Safaga. The mine is still not producing though there is still availability from an inventory estimated at about 100,000 mt.\\nThe cargo of rock, estimated to be around 40,000 mt, was understood to have been sold by Misr Phosphate into India at $94/mt FOB.\\nEgypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences. The country has previously only exported lower-grade rock, with a maximum P2O5 content of 30%.\\nNP/NPKS\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nUkraine: NPK imports at five-year low\\nUkraine\\'s Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.\\nImports from Russia saw the biggest drop, some 24%, at 165,000 mt or around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian deliveries fell by 18% year on year to 21,000 mt.\\nThe figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy appears to have shrunk by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.\\nIn the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK prices quoted lower\\nActivity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quotes European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.\\nWith high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are July tonnes.\\nIndia\\'s IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs, DAP and NPS during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.\\nIt is unclear whether PhosAgro plan to reduce NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Thailand\\'s NPK imports drop 23%\\nThailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.\\nIn the first four months of this year Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.\\nMalaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports over the same period in 2014. Russian producers supplied 22,000 mt and Indonesia shipped 13,000 mt.\\nMalaysia exported the same volume (58,000 mt) of NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.\\nPalm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The new deal reduces staff at its Dead Sea Works and Bromine operations as part of the company\\'s on-going efficiency plan. Workers have already returned to operations at DSW.\\nIndian buyers are said to be agreeing quantities for the current fertilizer year with ICL now that the strike is over and a volume announcement is expected within the next two weeks from the Israeli producer. Potash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.\\nThe US spot market has further weakened this week with Agrium believed to be offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB. Overall prices are believed to have fallen to as low as $365/st FOB in the Midwest and offers in the next few months are said to include price protection, indicating that further price falls could be imminent.\\nThe US imported 4.3 million mt of potash between January and April, 24% higher than the same point last year. With Canpotex reducing re-exports through Portland along with higher imports from Uralkali and new material from BPC so far in 2015, the US is proving to be an increasingly competitive market.\\nThe Chinese domestic market is out of season and purchasing activity is slow. The low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.\\nEurope is also out of season and prices are quoted at €300-310/mt CIF while Southeast Asian potash prices are flat at $310-350/mt CFR, but more Malaysian tenders have been awarded at $310-312/mt CFR levels.\\nBPC continued a strong month for deals after announcing that it has been awarded 80% of the volumes (192,000 mt) in a Bangladeshi tender this week. The company agreed an increase in volumes to India during IFA Istanbul and was recently awarded RCF\\'s tender for as much as 265,000 mt, with firm deliveries to be made this month.\\nSuppliers are pinning their hopes on Brazil for the coming months if they want to reverse the weak price levels seen so far in 2015 across most markets. Prices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases to as high as $345-350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries, before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.\\nAchieving their targets in Brazil should help suppliers recover losses in other key potash markets later in 2015. However, with Brazilian and US spot potash prices currently $40-50/mt lower than those at the end of 2014, the question is whether price discipline amongst suppliers remains strong enough.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙ICL strikes end, DSW returns to operations\\n∙ICL soon to announce Indian volumes agreement\\n∙US Midwest prices fall, $365-370/st FOB v $385-390/st FOB\\n∙US Saskatchewan Spot levels fall, $340-345/st v $375-375/st\\n∙Chinese Port Wholesale prices fall, RMB 2,000-2,100/mt v RMB 2,000-2,130/mt\\n∙EU gMOP prices €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙More Malaysian sMOP tenders awarded at $310-312/mt CFR\\n∙BPC wins 80% of volumes in Bangladeshi 240,000 mt tender at $344/mt CFR\\n∙Brazil gMOP prices flat at $330-340/mt CFR, suppliers begin price push\\n∙US potash imports up 24% Jan-Apr at 4.3 million mt\\n∙Canpotex exports up 17% Jan-Apr at 6.5 million mt\\n∙OCP raises NPK production, Moroccan potash imports up\\n∙QSL Potash produced 1.4 million mt Jan-Apr\\n∙Malaysian potash imports up 50% Jan-Feb, to 274,000 mt\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Potash exports up by 1 million mt\\nCanada exported 1.7 million mt potash in April, a 3.5% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.\\nAs a result, Canada has exported 6.5 million of potash in the year to date, 17% or 1 million mt more than the same period in 2014. Between January and April, 3.5 million mt was sent to the US and 903,000 mt was re- exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nThe country exported 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland.\\nIncluding the exports from Portland, in April Canpotex exported 404,000 mt to Brazil, 222,000 mt to China, 152,000 mt to Indonesia and 67,000 mt to India.\\nBetween January and April, including the exports from Portland, Canpotex exported 856,000 mt to Brazil, 664,000 mt to Indonesia, 575,000 mt to China, 358,000 mt to India and 468,000 mt to Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand combined.\\nUS: April potash imports flat but re-exports down\\nThe US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in April, largely flat year on year, bringing its year-to-date imports to 4.3 million mt, 24% higher than the same point in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nCanadian producers sent 922,000 mt to the US in April, with 237,000 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic. Despite imports being flat in April, re-exports fell 10% adding high competition and excess supply to the US market.\\nThe US also imported 92,772 mt from Uralkali during April, a 44% increase from the Russian producer year-on-year.\\nIn the year-to-date, the US imported 4.3 million mt of potash with 903,000 mt re-exported as part of the Canpotex agreement. 3.5 million mt came from Canada, 378,000 mt from Uralkali, 140,000 mt from BPC and 133,000 mt from ICL.\\nUS NOLA: Barge market anticipated fill market\\nGranular potash barge values fell in prior weeks, effectively anticipating aggressive fill marketing from Canadian and offshore potash suppliers in the US.\\nThe $325/st FOB New Orleans business completed in prior weeks thanks to excessive barge supplies in the Gulf likely figured into suppliers deciding on summer fill values.\\nCanada: Returns to Saskatchewan sellers lower from\\nUS\\nReturns to Saskatchewan potash producers are down substantially since the start of the spring, thanks to recent offers from some producers into the US for fill programs that began this month.\\nAt press time indications for Canadian granular potash were as low as $370/st FOB in the US Midwest, suggesting a return no better than $340/st FOB mine in Saskatchewan. Even these returns may come under pressure if cheaper offers of overseas material already in play force Canadian producers to match up.\\nUS Midwest: Potash fill offers include price protection\\nOffers for granular potash available to Midwest retailers during June-September include price protection, an assurance typically only employed by suppliers when they find their customer base is certain there will be cheaper values in coming months.\\nAgrium is named by market sources as offering June-September availability to Midwest buyers at around $370/st FOB, with price protection through October. Subsequently, a trader offered potash from overseas for June pickup from terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $365/st FOB. Price protection for this offer runs through September.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Potash prices stable ahead of suppliers push\\nBrazilian potash activity is expected to be quite strong through June and July but there have been limited deals this week as buyers return to Brazil from IFA Istanbul last week.\\nSuppliers are confident that with high demand in the coming weeks and price discipline, prices can be pushed up from the weak levels seen so far in 2015 and are banking on Brazilian increases to help push up other spot markets later in the year.\\nPrices currently remain at $330-340/mt CFR for Brazilian potash with unconfirmed deals as low as $325/mt CFR still reported. In coming weeks major suppliers plan to push for increases towards as high as $345- 350/mt CFR for June/July deliveries before again increasing prices for August/September delivery if possible.\\nIn some good news the Brazilian government has announced a 20% year-on-year increase in funding for the harvest support programme. Brazilian delegates at IFA voiced concerns over the availability of credit so the announcement may help ease those worries but depressed demand is likely to remain in Brazil, considering higher interest rates, inflation and low corn prices.\\nColombia: Potash imports at 100,000 mt in Q1\\nColombia imported 100,000 mt of potash in Q1, an 8% increase year on year and the highest Q1 imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the quarter, Colombia imported 55,000 mt from Canpotex, 25,000 mt from Uralkali and 13,000 mt from K+S.\\nRecent deals from BPC and Uralkali to Colombia are believed to have been made in the mid $340s/mt CFR.\\nColombia imported 486,595 mt of potash in 2014, a 30% increase year on year with Canpotex and Uralkali providing almost 80% of the imports.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Market out of season, prices largely stable\\nThe European market is largely stable this week and out of season. Prices are quoted €300-310/mt CIF to Northwest Europe for granular deals.\\nSome sources continue to highlight tight supply, particularly for standard potash, with most suppliers sending large volumes to China and India under the new contracts.\\nEuropean prices are unlikely to see major changes until the market begins to build again in July.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Potash imports rise as OCP ups NPK production\\nMorocco imported 57,000 mt of potash in Q1 2015, an increase from just 8,000 mt in Q1 2014 as OCP builds up its NPK production, according to GTIS data.\\nThe imports are more than OCP\\'s entire MOP imports in 2013 and already over half of the 109,035 mt of MOP imports in 2014. During the quarter, Morocco imported 26,000 mt from ICL\\'s Spanish operations, 15,000 mt from Uralkali and 14,000 mt from APC.\\nConcurrently, Q1 NPK exports from Morocco jumped to 88,000 mt from just 6,000 mt in Q1 2014 with large volumes delivered to Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Benin. In 2014, OCP exported 313,000 mt NPKs, with more than 75% going to the African markets.\\nThe Moroccan giant recently embarked on a major expansion with hopes of tripling its fertilizer output in 10 years. OCP also plans to increase its overall capacity of NPKs with the first of its new DAP/MAP/NPK plants expected to start commercial production in late June/early July at Jorf Lasfar. The fully integrated plant will have a capacity for 1 million mt DAP/MAP/NPKs.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: ICL soon to announce Indian agreements\\nBuyers in India have been in talks with ICL this week following news that the strike at its Dead Sea Works operations has come to an end.\\nZuari has confirmed that it has already agreed volumes with ICL, along with APC, BPC, Canpotex and Uralkali totalling 700,000 mt. ICL\\'s total list of quantity agreements should be announced in the next week or two and will likely be similar to the 700,000 mt it sent in the last fertilizer year.\\nDeepak Fertilisers has confirmed that it agreed to buy 60,000 mt from Uralkali while Chambal bought 100,000 mt from BPC and is currently in the process of buying another 100-120,000 mt, most likely from Uralkali.\\nPotash volumes agreed to India total around 3.7 million mt and, with at least another 1 million mt likely to be signed from ICL, K+S and as part of tenders through the year, total potash imports during the 2015/16 fertilizer year are likely to reach at least 4.5 million mt and could near 5.0 million mt.\\nAround 50,000 mt of potash is scheduled for arrival in the next week to India, inlcuding a 33,000 mt shipment from APC to IPL and an 18,000 mt shipment from Canpotex to TCL.\\nBangladesh: BPC awarded 80% of private tender\\nBPC will deliver 192,000 mt of potash to multiple importers as part of the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture private tender that closed on May 31.\\nBPC won the volumes at an average price of $344/mt with 180 days credit, excluding the price of bags, a spokeswoman for the company told Fertilizer Week.\\nThe MoA received offers from 21 importers representing different international suppliers.\\nThe potash part of the tender is for as much as 240,000 mt and shipment in September, with individual importers able to submit offers for a maximum of 24,000 mt MOP but suppliers not limited in the number of agents they may use.\\nThe 21 importers offered quantities between 10,000 and 24,000 mt and prices between $327.50/mt and $348.50/mt. These prices are quoted on a CFR basis including another $10/mt for bagging and other charges.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: More tenders awarded at lower prices in Malaysia\\nFurther tender awards have been announced in the $310-312/mt CFR level for Malaysia with prices unlikely to see any increases until the market builds back up in August/September.\\nMost of the larger tender awards were made during last week\\'s IFA Istanbul conference and action should be quite slow in the near term in Malaysia.\\nIndonesian potash is believed to be priced below the $325/mt CFR level with some sources quoting deals as low as $315/mt CFR. Quotes from the smaller markets such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand are made at $330-350/mt CFR.\\nAs a result, potash prices are currently seen at $310-350/mt CFR across Southeast Asia.\\nChina: QSL on track for 5 million mt production\\nQSL Potash, created by the merger of the two largest subsidiaries of QSL in March, is believed to have produced more than 1.4 million mt of potash between January and the end of April.\\nThe level puts QSL Potash on track to produce 4.5 million mt potash in 2015, allowing the whole group to reach its planned production of 5 million mt this year.\\nThe merged entity was created to improve management, efficiency and help increase production. Together their production levels represented roughly 86% of the 4.3 million mt produced by QSL in 2014.\\nChina: Domestic prices dip further during off-season\\nThe Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow. Port wholesale prices are largely stable with some slight falls at the top end of prices.\\nThe low end of red and white standard MOP prices continues to be seen at RMB 2,000-2,060 ($323-332)/mt FCA but the high end of prices, for 62% K2O white MOP, has fallen to RMB 2,100 ($339)/mt FCA from RMB 2,130/mt FCA.\\nArrivals of seaborne volumes remain at a stable high following recent contract agreements but some sources have suggested that border rail deliveries may be cut back in the coming months.\\nIn Q1, average potash rail deliveries from Russia are believed to have been around 175,000 mt but this rate is said to have fallen to 136,000 mt in April, with the new level expected to remain for May and June.\\nRail side spot prices into northern China are quoted as unchanged despite the recent $10/mt seaborne contract price increase, they remain at $300-305/mt CPT, but Uralkali has been boosted in the last six months by significant falls in the rail tariff to China after a switch to a less-costly route to Zabaikalsk on the border and the weak ruble.\\nJapan: Potash imports at five-year high\\nJapan imported 180,946 mt of potash between January and April, a 7% increase on the same period in 2014 and the highest January-April imports since 2010, according to GTIS.\\nJapan imported 138,000 mt from Canpotex, or 77% of its entire imports, while 20,000 mt was imported from Uralkali. Canpotex concluded its H1 potash contracts for Japan in December 2014 at an average price of over $410/mt CFR depending on grade, an agreement for the second half is likely to be made shortly.\\nWhile Q1 imports were down on 2014, in April Japan imported 68,000 mt or five-times the imports in April 2014.\\nJapan\\'s full-year 2014 imports were 534,365 mt, a 12% year-on-year increase, with 73% of the imports coming from Canpotex.\\nMalaysia: Early 2015 potash imports up 50%\\nMalaysia imported 273,606 mt of potash in January and February, a 50% increase year on year and the highest January-February imports since 2003, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period both Canpotex and Uralkali increased volumes by 8% and 10% respectively but BPC saw the largest increase, sending more than 60,000 mt compared with just 7,000 mt in the same period during 2014. ICL\\'s Spanish operations sent 27,400 mt and APC sent more than 25,000 mt.\\nThe figures confirm high levels of competition in Malaysia, which coupled with strong inventory levels and currency depreciation, has held down prices in the key Southeast Asian country.\\nMalaysia imported 1.6 million mt potash in the full year 2014, a 29% increase on its 2013 imports and\\nits largest on record. The increase is largely due to higher palm oil output in 2014, which rose 2.1% during the year to 20.09 million mt, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In 2015, palm oil output is expected to continue its increase but at a much slower rate due to recent flooding and weaker commodity prices.\\nSOP\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Archean plans to start SOP exports this month\\nArchean Group\\'s Rann of Kutch Gujarat project began production of SOP in April after a lengthy overrun, the company told Fertilizer Week.\\nThe project, which is set to produce 100,000 mt/year of SOP before ramping up towards as much as 400,000 mt/year, was planned for operation in the second half of 2011.\\nHowever, development of the project has been slow and key environmental approvals were not awarded until earlier this year.\\nArchean plans to sell material to export markets from June onwards and it is targeting sales for Europe and Asia but it is yet to sign any firm agreements over exports.\\nNPKS\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nUkraine: NPK imports at five-year low\\nUkraine\\'s Q1 NPK imports were 195,000 mt, a 21% fall year on year and the lowest Q1 imports since 2010 as conflict continues with separatist rebels in the east of the country.\\nImports from Russia saw the biggest drop, 24%, with Russian producers sending 165,000 mt, around 50,000 mt less than the same period in 2014. Belarusian producers sent 21,000 mt, 18% less than last year.\\nThe figures come as an International Monetary Fund mission to the country announced that the Ukrainian economy is likely to have shrank by a worse-than-expected 9% in Q1 2015.\\nIn the full year 2014, Ukraine imported 791,642 mt of NPKs according to GTIS, down by 9% on 2013. Russian NPKs accounted for 85% of the import market last year with 13% of all imports supplied from Belarus.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK prices quoted lower this week with limited activity\\nActivity remains slow in the European NPK market, but with suppliers largely sold out through June after selling product to other markets, sources are confident that higher prices can soon be achieved for the multi- component fertilizer in Europe.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 have fallen slightly to $320-335/mt FOB while 16-16-16 prices are down by $5/mt to $335-345/mt FOB. OCP quote European prices for 15-15-15 at $350/mt FOB but deals at this level are unconfirmed at this point.\\nWith high levels of NPK activity in Southeast Asia, India, China and Africa so far in 2015, most suppliers say their order books are largely full through June and the prices quoted are for deals from July.\\nIndia\\'s IPL is now increasing NPK imports after signing a three-year deal to buy 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs and DAP during the IFA conference last week. The deal between PhosAgro and IPL suggests around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26.\\nIt is unclear whether PhosAgro plans to reduce some NPK sales into Europe in the coming few years in the wake of the new deal in India but in November 2014 the company said it plans to more than double NP/NPK/NPS sales to Europe by 2020.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Thailand\\'s NPK imports drop 23%\\nThailand imported 306,000 mt of NPKs between January and April, a 23% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Thailand imported the same volumes of NPKs from Russian producers as in 2014 (224,000 mt) but it saw a 64% reduction in Yara imports.\\nMalaysia imported 58,000 mt of NPKs in January and February, doubling its imports for the same period in 2014. Russian producers sent 22,000 mt and Indonesia sent 13,000 mt.\\nMalaysia exported the same volumes (58,000 mt) NPKs with 92% going to Indonesia.\\nPalm oil production growth in Southeast Asia is likely to slow in 2015 and may have an impact on overall NPK imports across the region.\\nNEWS\\nFINANCIALS\\nUralkali extends pre-export facility by $100 million\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali has signed a $100 million increase on its $530 million pre-export finance facility with the Bank of China.\\nThe facility has now increased to $630 million and there is an option to increase the loan amount by another $170 million to a total of $800 million.\\nThe loan agreement, which was agreed in April, is with eight international banks, including Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Industrial Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank.\\nThe interest rate on the deal is LIBOR plus 330 bps margin with a loan maturity of four years. Uralkali plans to use the loan for general corporate purposes, including helping fund its ambitious $4.5 billion expansion plans to raise capacity by 30% over the next five years.\\nThe news comes a week after Uralkali investors tendered for 11.89% of shares in its recently-announced share buyback. The deal sees Uralkali buy $1.12 billion in stock rather than the $1.5 billion it had planned.\\nUralkali may now have enough offers to buy shares in order to delist from the London Stock Exchange. With some shareholders believed to see the company as undervalued, Uralkali may now look to take the company private.\\nAcron Q1 net income up on weak ruble, efficiency measures\\nRussian fertilizer producer Acron\\'s revenues and net profit increased in the first quarter due to efficiency measures and the weak rouble despite a decrease in sales volumes in its key products.\\nAcron posted a 59% increase in revenues to RUB 27.7 billion ($445 million), due mainly to a collapse in ruble exchange rates at the end of 2014, as well higher year-on-year dollar-denominated prices for complex fertilizers.\\nThe company\\'s net profit increased to RUB 7.1 billion from RUB 1.4 billion in Q1 2014 with Acron saying that its Oleniy Ruchey mine achieved record operating results of 100,000 mt of apatite concentrate during March.\\nOn a dollar basis using Acron\\'s average exchange rate across Q1 2015 and Q1 2014, revenues fell to $444.7 million against $496.3 million, but net profit increased to $113.6 million from $41.1 million.\\nThe company said the output of its key products was 1.6 million mt, down 2% year on year, and its sales of key products fell 4% to 1.5 million mt due to maintenance at its Novgorod-based facility.\\nAcron noted that costs of goods sold increased, mainly due to higher comparative potash prices, which are pegged to the dollar exchange rate. The company also posted an exchange loss of RUB 1.4 billion from the revaluation of its assets, loans and liabilities.\\nPhosAgro boosts Q1 net profits on higher production\\nRussian fertilizer producer PhosAgro increased net profits in its first quarter on a dollar basis to $228 million from $55 million the previous year as production, sales volumes and most prices increased.\\nThe company said total fertilizer production increased 8% year-on-year due to efficiency measures, with its phosphates operations recording a 4% increase in sales volumes to 1.3 million mt. Its nitrates division saw a 3% fall in sales volumes to 412,500 mt.\\nFirst quarter revenues were up 71% on a rouble basis but due to the massive depreciation of the currency against the dollar at the end of 2014, revenues are down on a dollar basis to $808 million from $841 million.\\nThe company said it received higher realised prices on a rouble basis for DAP/MAP and NPK exports during Q1. Average DAP prices in Q1 were $483/mt FOB Tampa, up 2% year on year.\\nOn a rouble basis, revenue from DAP/MAP sales more than doubled and revenue from phosphate rock sales increased 22%, but sales volumes decreased 27% due to higher internal consumption. NPK export sales more than doubled.\\nPhosAgro saw a net loss in Q4 from revaluation of USD and EUR denominated loans but a clean slate in 2015 coupled with higher production has given the company a good start to the year.\\nIn February, PhosAgro commissioned a new phosphate-potash-sulphur fertilizer production line with capacity of 100,000mt/year and the company said it now intends to invest further in expansion of the number of NPK and other fertilizer grades it produces.\\nIn the upcoming summer season PhosAgro expects significant buying activity from India and Brazil and it noted that it now expects India\\'s 2015 DAP imports to reach 5.5-6 million mt in 2015, at least a 2 million mt increase on last year.\\nDuring the IFA conference this week, PhosAgro agreed a three-year deal to sell 1.35 million mt of Russian NPKs to India.\\nThe deal between PhosAgro and IPL is over a three year period suggesting around 400-450,000 mt per year and will be mainly 15-15-15 and 10-26-26 but also including DAP and NPS.\\nPhosAgro has not shipped any NPKs to India in such sizeable volumes since 2012 when it exported an estimated 250,000 mt through Ameropa against its contract with IFFCO.\\nThe company said in a conference call May 29 that individual sales as part of the contract would be made on a spot basis. At today\\'s prices and freights, Indian netbacks on Russian DAP are in the low/mid $450s/mt FOB Baltic, significantly lower than potential netbacks from Brazil at current price levels of $500/mt CFR.\\nDespite the current weak rupee, PhosAgro forecasts significantly higher NPK demand outweighing domestic output in the coming years due to high internal production costs. During 2014, domestic NPK production rose by 13% to 7.8 million mt and so far in 2015, domestic production has risen further.\\nThe new PhosAgro deal could also have an effect on potash demand in India. If domestic NPK production slows due to the imported NPKs then the recent trend of higher potash buying could slow.\\nFREIGHT/SHIPPING\\nK+S begins modifications at Port Moody\\nGerman potash producer K+S and Pacific Coast Terminals Co. have begun modifications to the existing bulk handling facility in Port Moody, Canada, in order for the site to take potash from the Legacy project.\\nK+S Potash Canada is currently on track and on budget to start potash production in late 2016 at the CAD\\n4.1billion Legacy solution mine in Saskatchewan. The company plans to ramp up production to two million mt/year by 2017 before a gradual extension of the annual capacity to 2.86 million mt of potash products.\\nThe handling facility stores and transports potash products arriving by rail and will allow K+S access to its international clients from the Legacy site. Completion of the modifications is planned for late 2016.\\nPEOPLE\\nICL comes to agreement with striking workers\\nAfter three months of strikes at Israeli fertilizer producer ICL\\'s Dead Sea Potash Works and Neot Hovav Bromine operations in Israel, an agreement has been reached and employees will return to work immediately, ICL said in a press release May 29.\\nManagement at ICL have now signed an agreement with Israel\\'s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and unions representing ICL Israel employees. The deal provides a new framework for ICL\\'s restructuring plan and allows for a reduction in the workforce at both production facilities.\\nAccording to the final terms, the labour reduction at ICL Dead Sea Works and ICL Neot Hovav will total 248 employees, 210 of which will be through an early retirement plan.\\nThe strike, which began in mid-February, cost ICL $164 million in lost revenues in Q1 and net income was hit by $76 million. The company said the impact of the strike will be higher in Q2 due to depleted inventories of bromine during the quarter.\\nICL said that while the strike was costly it considers it to have been \\'a worthwhile investment in the future of its plants in Israel\\' and the economic benefits of the strike will \\'significantly exceed its costs\\'.\\nThe company said that DSW facilities have been less competitive in the past few years due to lower potash prices and high labour costs in Israel, while an \\'unfriendly business environment… by the previous Israeli government\\' led to higher taxes and royalties.\\nThe strikes are likely to have cost ICL as much as 1 million mt in production from the Dead Sea Works so far in 2015. The company has managed to make divestments to boost its net income in Q1 and covered some of its lost sales volumes by increasing production at its Spanish and UK operations.\\nThe company also still managed to agree its major Chinese potash contracts for 2015, with buyers agreeing that volumes which ICL fails to provide in the first half of the year due to the strikes can be replaced by extra volumes in the second half of the year.\\nEnding the strike comes just in time for ICL to agree a new contract with its Indian buyers, after Belarusian potash producer BPC agreed its volumes during the IFA Conference this week. Last year ICL agreed roughly\\n700,000 mt in quantities to its Indian customers and the company is likely to have already conducted discussions over new contracts during the conference in anticipation of the end to strikes.\\nDespite it already being nearly two months into the new fertilizer year in India, potash demand is expected to increase in the country and ICL should be able to agree similar quantities to its Indian buyers.\\nTRADE\\nICL may owe Haifa over potash pricing\\nIsraeli fertilizer producer ICL may have to make a provision in its Q2 financial statements to pay as much as $70 million to Haifa over potash pricing in 2012-13, Israeli publication The Marker reported on May 2.\\nThe most recent ruling in on-going arbitration proceedings regarding potash pricing from ICL to Haifa for its NOP requirements has found that settlement over payments between the two parties needs to be made for between 2011 and 2013.\\nAn examiner for the court ruled that a refund should be paid by Haifa to ICL\\'s Dead Sea Works operations for 2011 but that for both 2012 and 2013, Haifa can request returns from ICL to meet a court formula agreement over pricing.\\nIn early 2014, an Israeli court ruled that quarterly sales prices for potash to Haifa would be based on a formula rather than a set price by ICL.\\nICL may now be liable to pay $60-70 million to Haifa, according to The Marker.\\nIn ICL\\'s 2014 financial report it said that the company was unlikely to have to pay significant amounts in respect to 2009-2013 and no provisions were included in the 2014 figures.\\nICL says it is reviewing the court ruling and intends to petition the court against it over the 2012-13 decision. The company also noted that it was is reviewing any provision that may need to be made in its Q2 financial statements.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Availability is understood to be tight, and sellers report enquiries for both spot volumes and contractual top-ups.\\nMarket participants are waiting for Aramco to finalise its July price on June 10. An increase is expected, though the scale of the increase has yet to be determined.\\nIn addition, Middle Eastern sellers are hoping to finalise all Q3 contract talks next week in advance of Ramadan, and these talks will also provide indications of the market direction.\\nDomestic Chinese prices also climbed, as domestic availability was relatively tight. Sources also suggested that buyers in China were demonstrating a greater willingness to accept import prices in the high $150s/mt CFR than last week.\\nHowever, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand, as monsoon delays and the weak rupee add further impetus for declines in Chinese phosphate export prices, and this may make Chinese phosphate producers more cautious about buying sulphur. Indian sulphur price ideas were also heard lower on the week, and the country\\'s Q1 imports were down 3.8% despite March imports climbing 28.2% from a year earlier.\\nOCP remains out of the sulphur spot market at present as it is content with term contracts. The country’s Q1 imports climbed 8.8% on the year.\\nElsewhere, the US imported another 27,500 mt of sulphur form Kazakhstan in April, further demonstrating that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.\\nMeanwhile, Fertilizer Week published its June short-term forecast, which suggests a similar trend to the previous month’s iteration, although forecast levels are lower overall given a greater than anticipated decline in May prices.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Adnoc increases OSP to $145/mt FOB for June\\n∙KPC\\'s latest 30,000 mt tender goes at $146/mt FOB\\n∙Middle East spot reported in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\n∙Chinese domestic prices climb further\\n∙Market concerned over Indian phosphate outlook\\n∙Moroccan Q1 imports up 8.8%\\n∙US brings in further Kazakh sulphur in April\\n∙Fertilizer Week published latest short term forecast\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Further solid sulphur brought in from Kazakhstan\\nThe US imported another sulphur cargo from Kazakhstan in April, bringing in 27,500 mt from the FSU country. This further demonstrates that US sulphur buyers are implementing their previously-stated strategy to bring in solid sulphur from overseas and re-melt in the US Gulf.\\nMosaic’s 1 million mt/year sulphur melter at its New Wales Florida phosphate complex, planned as a way to benefit from global sulphur availability, is expected to start in Q4 2015. It will reduce the buyer’s dependency on North American suppliers of molten sulphur. In the meantime, Mosaic is expected to take advantage of\\nexisting sulphur melting facilities at Galveston, Texas, to enable it to bring in formed sulphur from overseas. After melting at Galveston, the company would use its molten carrier to transport product to Tampa.\\nThe ability to use sulphur from a wider range of sources should give buyers more negotiating power and reduce risks around availability.\\nIn 2014, the US imported 25,000 mt from Kazakhstan in July and 27,500 mt in September. Prior to this it had not imported Kazakh sulphur.\\nUS: Q1 sulphur production down 2.3%\\nUS sulphur production for March 2015 was 724,000 mt, down 4.5% year on year and up 8.4% from the previous month, according to the US Geological Survey.\\nThis brought total production for the first quarter to 2.12 million mt, down 2.3% year on year.\\nMarch shipments were down 4.3% on the year at 728,000 mt, while Q1 shipments were down 3.2% at 2.14 million mt.\\nUS stockpiles in March were 137,000 mt.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Contractual loading running smoothly\\nSellers of Russian product report that they are currently distributing contractual volumes to buyers and everything is running smoothly.\\nA large proportion of Russian deliveries is aimed at Morocco.\\nQ2 contract talks for Russian supply are unlikely to commence until late June.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nJordan: JPMC closes 50,000 mt tender\\nJPMC closed a tender June 2 for 50,000 mt sulphur for July 15-20 arrival, but no conclusion was yet disclosed.\\nThe buyer\\'s last tender for 50,000 mt, which closed on May 7, was awarded at around $155/mt CFR.\\nMiddle East: Spot prices firm on lack of availability\\nRecent spot business from the Middle East has been reported as high as $148/mt FOB, although there have also been spot sales this week in the low $140s/mt FOB.\\nSellers report steady spot enquiries and enquiries for top-ups on term contracts, but say they have little to no availability for June.\\nOne seller noted that the majority of bid levels had risen from the mid-$130s/mt FOB last week to the low-to- mid-$140s/mt FOB this week.\\nMarket participants awaited confirmation of Saudi Aramco July price, which is expected to be finalised June 10. The seller is likely to increase the price from its June level of $142/mt FOB Jubail.\\nIn addition, Middle Eastern sellers plan to conduct Q3 contract talks next week, as producers want to settle agreements before Ramadan begins June 18.\\nKuwait: KPC 30,000 mt tender at $146/mt FOB\\nKPC’s tender for 20,000 mt sulphur that closed on May 26 was reportedly awarded in the low $140s/mt FOB.\\nThe seller is understood to have subsequently sold another 30,000 mt cargo this week that closed June 2 at $146/mt FOB.\\nMorocco: Q1 sulphur imports increase 9%\\nMorocco’s imports of sulphur for Q1 increased 8.8% year on year to 1.08 million mt.\\nRussia and the UAE were the main suppliers in Q1, as the source of 341,810 mt and 314,997 mt respectively.\\nOther key sources were the US (114,611 mt), Poland (98,008 mt), Spain (68,334 mt) and Kuwait (62,996 mt).\\nMorocco: OCP sticking to contracts for now\\nThe Moroccan spot sulphur market has remained quiet in recent weeks, with OCP suggesting that it is focusing on term contracts and waiting for lower prices.\\nMeanwhile, Q2 contracts for North African granular business are assessed at $145-152/mt CFR based on feedback from buyers and sellers. Although buyer sources had suggested prices as low as $131.50/mt CFR, this level is not considered representative of mainstream business.\\nUAE: Adnoc posts $145/mt FOB June OSP\\nAdnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $145/mt FOB Ruwais for June, up $5/mt from its May level.\\nThis represents a delivered price to India in the high $150s/mt CFR.\\nThe price is roughly in line with market expectations, and further indicates that prices have stabilised and show some potential for increasing.\\nIt follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for June at $141/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $2/mt from its April level.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Price ideas lower despite increases elsewhere\\nIFFCO reportedly bought two cargoes from Japanese suppliers at $154/mt CFR and 158/mt CFR respectively, though it was not confirmed whether this was contractual business.\\nThis is below where prices have been pegged recently and below FACT’s tender purchase two weeks ago in the mid-$160s/mt CFR, and Indian buyers have expressed lower price ideas this week.\\nIf the purchases were on a spot basis, the price level is surprising given that global prices have firmed in recent weeks.\\nRCF has not yet decided on an award for its 10,000 mt tender that closed May 15. Offers were INR 9,093/mt EXW from Reliance, INR 10,515/mt EXW from Essar, INR 8,485/mt EXW from MRPL, and $170/mt CFR from Swiss Singapore.\\nIndia: March sulphur imports climb 28% year on year\\nIndia’s March imports of sulphur increased 28.2% year on year to 145,734 mt, leaving Q1 imports down 3.8% at 382,483 mt.\\nMost of the tonnes came from the Middle East, with 65,933 mt from Saudi Arabia, 31,500 mt from Qatar, 27,410 mt from Kuwait, and 6,210 mt from Bahrain.\\nIn addition, Japan supplied 12,015 mt and\\nTurmenistan supplied 1,693 mt.\\nSaudi Arabia and Qatar were also the largest suppliers for the quarter overall, at 170,287 mt and 103,430 mt respectively.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Prices firming but concerns overs phosphates\\nDomestic sulphur prices in China increased further this week, rising around RMB 20/mt.\\nPrices at ports were in the RMB 1,200-1,240/mt FCA range, with the upper end of this representing offer levels at Fangcheng.\\nOne key driver for increases was lower production levels from Sinopec’s Puguang refinery. The producer again increased its own prices, with its price at Wenzhou port now RMB 1,190/mt FCA and its ex-factory price at RMB 1,170/mt FCA. In addition to lowering its production, Pugaung has successfully lowered its stock levels over recent weeks, leaving domestic supply tighter.\\nAnother driver of price increases was the higher FOB prices posted by Middle Eastern sellers and tight international availability of spot product, although this has not yet had a large effect on Chinese CFR prices.\\nMany Chinese traders had expected price declines, and so don’t currently have much stock. Although they may be willing to accept as high as $157-158/mt CFR, they would resist anything higher, as even this level leaves little margin on sales.\\nHowever, sources reported an increased willingness on the part of buyers to accept levels in the high\\n$150s/mt CFR that were still being resisted last week. One export seller even suggested that they had been told Chinese phosphate producers would be willing to pay $165/mt CFR.\\nOn the other hand, although Chinese phosphate production is relatively stable, there are concerns over export prices. Indian demand for phosphate imports is being damaged by delays in the monsoon as well as weakness in the rupee, and this is adding pressure on Chinese phosphate export prices to decrease. Phosphate producers are therefore somewhat cautious in buying sulphur.\\nLittle change was reported in crushed lump or molten sulphur.\\nInventories climbed to around 980,000 mt, and are expected to reach over 1 million mt within the coming week.\\nSome traders expect prices to reach RMB 1,250/mt FCA soon, but others believe that this view is overly optimistic.\\nJapan: April sulphur exports climb 3.5%\\nJapan’s April exports of sulphur increased 3.5% year on year to 89,357 mt, though exports for the first four months of the year were still down 6.4% at 400,726 mt.\\nThe vast majority of the tonnes, 61,756 mt, went to China.\\nOther destinations included India (11,997 mt), Indonesia (11,498 mt), and South Korea (2,717 mt).\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

India’s Q1 imports were up 22.6% at 282,717 mt, following a 77.6% year-on-year increase in March volumes.\\nBut although Asian spot prices have increased recently, they are still not high enough to attract export sales interest from Two Lions, which is focused on the more attractive domestic market where prices have also been rising as a result of maintenance turnarounds.\\nThe Chilean market remains quiet with a lack of spot activity. Most sources pegged prices at $80-85/mt CFR, saying that some interest was starting to surface, but others said that anything above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Chile’s April imports dropped 26% on the year, leaving total imports to date down slightly.\\nEuropean spot prices were stable, with little new business this week and disputes on true notional levels. The most recent traded levels are in line with prices of the past several months, although reports that last week’s sales to Argentina went in the mid-$80s/mt CFR out of Antwerp suggested that the tendency may be downwards rather than upwards.\\nMorocco is still absent from the spot market, though a buyer source suggested that offer levels from Europe were declining. Trade data showed that the country’s Q1 imports were up by nearly a third, though it is still unlikely that its total 2015 imports will reach the level of the previous year.\\nMeanwhile, Fertilizer Week\\'s short term forecast for June displayed little change from the previous month\\'s iteration, with global prices not expected to change much throughout the forecast period, though there is greater uncertainty over the later months in the forecast.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Asian FOB spot prices rise further\\n∙Indian spot demand persists into $70s/mt CFR\\n∙Indian Q1 imports climb after strong March\\n∙Two Lions focused on domestic market\\n∙Chilean spot market quiet with prices pegged around $80/mt CFR\\n∙Chile\\'s April imports plunge\\n∙Morocco sticks to term contracts but reports lower offers\\n∙Fertilizer Week publishes latest short term forecast\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals prices reached their lowest levels since mid-April, or in the case of copper since March, before recovering slightly later in the week but remaining below last week\\'s levels. Reported macroeconomic indicators were relatively weak, and concerns are still evident over both Chinese weakness and a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. LME copper was down to $5,991.50/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nThere is more smoke than fire in US phosphate and even global phosphate trade this week. Mosaic has taken a more aggressive stance on US domestic DAP pricing this week. This supports expectations that the US phosphate giant intends to continue running as close to capacity as it can over the summer.\\nFurther signs of slightly higher prices were evident in sulphur markets this week, as Adnoc increased its OSP by $5/mt to $145/mt FOB for June and recent Middle East sales were heard in the high $140s/mt FOB. In addition, domestic Chinese prices climbed on relatively tight availability. However, concerns persist over expected weakness in Indian phosphates demand and its likely effect on Chinese phosphates exports, and Indian sulphur buyers also suggested lower price ideas this week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices remain unchanged at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China reflecting stability in the sulphuric acid and ammonia markets.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: April sulphuric acid imports climb 28%\\nUS imports of sulphuric acid for April climbed 28.2% year on year to 291,283 mt, leaving imports for the first four months up 8.4% at 1.12 million mt.\\nAlthough the majority of the April imports came from Canada, which supplied 159,993 mt, and much of the remainder came from Mexico, which supplied 58,001 mt, the US continued to increase its imports from Europe.\\nFor April, Finland supplied 18,902 mt, Belgium supplied 18,121 mt, Germany supplied 18,058 mt, and Poland supplied 17,451 mt.\\nCanada: April sulphuric acid exports up 2.5%\\nCanada’s April exports of sulphuric acid climbed 2.5% year on year, but imports for the first four months of the year were still down 0.9% at 643,504 mt.\\nEffectively all of the tonnes went to the US.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nChile: April acid imports plunge 26%\\nChile\\'s April imports of sulphuric acid dropped 25.8% year on year to 176,276 mt, leaving imports for the first four months of the year down 2.2% at 778,487 mt.\\nMost of the April tonnes came from Peru, which supplied 104,130 mt, with the remainder coming from Brazil and Japan, which supplied 40,631 mt and 31,419 mt respectively.\\nThese same three countries supplied almost all of Chile’s February and March imports too.\\nChile: Spot market quiet and notional levels disputed\\nThe spot sulphuric acid market in Chile remains quiet, with no new business reported this week.\\nAlthough most sources continue notionally to peg prices at $80-90/mt CFR, with the majority at the lower end of this range, others argue that this is unrealistic, with some in Chile suggesting that any sales above $80/mt CFR would be difficult to achieve. Indeed, some traders have suggested that recent business has been much closer to the $80/mt CFR.\\nThere is little sign of an increase in Chilean spot demand, but with fewer tonnes leaving Mexico and Peruvian exports also likely to inch down, buyers may be more active in the spot market in H2.\\nPeru: March sulphuric acid exports down 8.5%\\nPeru’s March exports of sulphuric acid declined 8.5% year on year to 139,710 mt, although this was the largest monthly volume of exports since the previous March.\\nTotal exports for Q1 at 330,087 mt were also down 8.5% on the year.\\nAlmost all of the tonnes for March and the whole of Q1 went to Chile, other than 1,554 mt to Panama in March.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot export prices remain stable\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained pegged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with little firm indication of business outside this range.\\nAlthough some sources suggested that prices as high as $38/mt FOB would now be realistic, while others suggested that even prices in the $30s/mt FOB would be difficult to obtain, recent reported trades have remained at similar levels for several months.\\nHowever, some sources suggested that last week’s sale to Argentina, which was previously thought to be in the $90s/mt CFR, was in fact bought at $85/mt CFR for loading from Antwerp.\\nTurkey: Q1 sulphuric acid imports down 8%\\nTurkey’s sulphuric acid imports for Q1 2015 declined 8% year on year to 142,447 mt.\\nAlmost all of the Q1 tonnes came from Aurubis\\'s Pirdop smelter in Bulgaria, although 7,569 mt came from Italy.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Q1 sulphuric acid imports climb 31%\\nMorocco’s Q1 imports of sulphuric acid were up 30.8% year on year at 244,767 mt, demonstrating a strong start to the year.\\nThe imports were split between a range of European countries, with Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium the biggest suppliers, while Italy, Sweden, Norway and Germany made up the remainder.\\nMorocco’s imports for 2015 are still overall expected to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nThe country is forecast to continue importing sulphuric acid in 2015 as OCP conducts upgrade work across its installed capacity. Morocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility. CRU forecasts acid import demand at 590,000 mt in 2015.\\nMorocco: Spot quiet but offer levels heard declining\\nMoroccan spot sulphuric business has been quiet, as OCP has mainly been focused on term contracts and has offered little spot enquiry in recent weeks, market sources said.\\nHowever, a buyer source suggested that offers for spot sulphuric acid have declined $5-10/mt in recent weeks, and that current published Northwest European spot prices are above offer levels to North Africa.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Spot demand persists\\nIndian spot demand for sulphuric acid remained firm, with most pegging prices in the $60-70/mt CFR range and some reports of recent business as high as the mid-$70s/mt CFR.\\nSources suggested that Indian buyers are having to cover product that was expected but has not been available due to Asian tightness. It is understood that delays in the startup of PPL’s sulphur burner have also\\nled to greater spot requirements, and some suggest this will persist to October, though the buyer has yet to confirm.\\nCRU currently forecasts stable sulphuric acid output from PPL this year and next at 660,000 mt/year, though this is expected to rise to 1.02 million mt/year in 2017 and 1.4 million mt/year thereafter.\\nIndia: Sulphuric acid imports jump 78%\\nIndia’s sulphuric acid imports for March climbed 77.6% to 100,300 mt, leaving Q1 imports up 22.6% at 282,717 mt.\\nSouth Korea was the source of 39,231 mt, while Japan supplied 26,970 mt.\\nOf the remaining tonnes, 19,493 mt came from the Philippines, 8,002 mt came from North Korea, and 6,600 mt came from Taiwan.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Two Lions not exporting as Chinese prices climb\\nTwo Lions is not currently considering spot exports of sulphuric acid, as domestic Chinese prices have been increasing and international offers from Japanese and South Korean sellers are lower than the price level the producer would be seeking.\\nSulphuric acid prices in China climbed a further RMB 10-20/mt in several regional markets over the past week. Inner Mongolia has seen increases of around RMB 20/mt as several smelters have shutdowns in the May-June period. This affects Hubei province too as they buy acid from Inner Mongolia.\\nIn Jiangsu, where Two Lions is located, sulphur burners have also increased prices because of short upcoming maintenances.\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot prices climb on tightness, Indian demand\\nEast Asian spot prices for sulphuric acid exports have been reported higher by several sources, with business reaching $30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea and one trader suggesting that deals had been done even higher.\\nSome sources continued to peg the upper end of the price range at $25/mt FOB.\\nTight availability has meant that buyers have had limited options to meet spot requirements and have had to pay more in many cases.\\nThe lack of spot availability and high CFR levels to India supported the increase, and India remains the main source of spot demand.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi’s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko’s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc’s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc’s Onsan smelter shut May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days, though the length has yet to be confirmed.\\nJapan: April sulphuric acid exports drop 10%\\nJapan’s April exports of sulphuric acid declined 9.9% year on year to 213,739 mt, leaving exports for the first four months of the year down 5.8% at 926,166 mt.\\nThe Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 86,976 mt of the April tonnes.\\nIndia was the next largest importer, taking 56,174 mt.\\nThailand took 26,159 mt, Australia took 21,999 mt, and Chile took 10,503 mt. The volume to Thailand is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since February 2014.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Consensus is however building for mainstream numbers well in excess of $315/mt CFR for East Coast India (ECI) ports such as Krishnapatnam offering fast discharge terms. This based on expected FOB values above $300/mt FOB from China.\\nHigher freights for panamax carriers and the supramax segment are indicative of freights around $12/mt from northern China for the larger sizes, and some $2-3/mt more for supramax tonnage. Transaction costs are assessed at $2-3/mt for a package around an even $15/mt with very limited provisions for margins.\\nAvailability from Iran to load by July 27 is assessed below 400,000 mt with costs likely to pan out around $300/mt FOB or marginally lower. Freight is estimated above $10/mt and suppliers of Iranian material also need to factor in provisions for insurance which is for seller\\'s account acording to STC tender terms. This plus transaction charges and the extra costs of processing payments for Iranian material also point to delivered values higher than $315/mt CFR for fast WCI ports.\\nMore aggressive offers from either origin can however not be excluded. Some traders point to added availability of Chinese urea in July as domestic demand wanes, and may elect to short the market down to netbacks available in recent small regional trades around $295/mt FOB, if not lower.\\nOffers for July positions in paper markets for Middle East tonnage posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at an even $300/mt FOB were attracting bids no higher than $295/mt FOB June 18, indicating that competitive offers to STC may also emerge from this source.\\nLimited availability through July from the Black Sea does not suggest competition from FSU tonnage, but offers based on firm quotes in paper markets for July positions at $288-290/mt FOB Yuzhnyy could conceivably match mainstream offers from China for WCI ports basis current freight estimates.\\nThe US market is meanwhile also in traders\\' focus. Soaring values for prompt barge positions, already have attracted tonnage that had originally been planned for delivery to Brazil. Four cargos of granular\\nurea totaling about 110,000 mt previously expected to head for Brazil now are destined for the US from\\nAlgeria, with arrival dates from June 25 to 2H July. The July lineup, fattened somewhat be delays in arrivals from June, has reached 900,000 mt.\\nThis is despite declines in offers for 1H July barges. While barges confirmed for delivery before he July 4 holiday sold around $350/st FOB New Orleans, forward offers of physical tons for 1H July were available at $300-305/st FOB at press time. August offers were cited in the $290s/st FOB, and a physical sale at $295/st FOB was confirmed at press time.\\nMarkets for prilled urea outside India have been less active as traders are unwilling to assume significant risk in adding length or going short ahead of the Indian session.\\nTenders scheduled in Sri Lanka for granular and prilled urea and in Nepal for prills have attracted some attention while the upcoming sessions in Pakistan to procure a further 150,000 mt are yet to be announced.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙STC tender June 19 at center of attention\\n∙US July import lineup reaches 900-950,000 mt, forward offers plunge\\n∙Chinese prills trade at par with regular quality granular, albeit via short positions\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA awards Dreymoor and floats additional tender\\n∙Pakistan tenders yet to be floated, but suggested imminent\\n∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, and AOA output also suggested restored\\n∙Brazilian importers maintain hard-line despite diversions of cargos to the US\\n∙Egyptian output still erratic but MOPCO II trials start\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed, but bears outside the US have gathered a slightly larger following than bulls in recent days. Market direction will be clearer June 19 when offers in the STC tender are submitted, but quotes in that session are expected to be relatively widely spread. The general agreement for downward adjustments in granular values from recent US peaks is still apparent, but the timing remains an open question.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Dry conditions hammer crops, cut urea use\\nMarket expectations in western Canada have undergone a 180 degree turn and distributors are expecting substantially lower fill pricing in coming weeks. Just a month or two ago, railcars of urea were moving from the US for applications on canola and other crops. But severely dry weather since then threatens yields and warehouses in Alberta and elsewhere have substantial carryover granular urea.\\nUS N Plains: Cheaper fill offers tug on spot values\\nSpot offers of granular urea for prompt delivery crept down this week to around $390/st DEL for trucks and railcars. However, more severe cuts in prompt pricing are likely given fill offers from suppliers for summer delivery from Canada and elsewhere.\\nLate season disappointment with Canadian demand has led to more aggressive pricing for summer granular urea by Agrium and others into the Dakotas. Offers are as low as $345/st DEL. This is down about $50/st from prior weeks. This price tag likely will be reflected in the prompt market for the Dakotas by July, if not sooner, according to regional distributors.\\nUS NOLA: Trader shorts drive June sales, July weaker\\nPush almost came to shove between a few traders on some short sales that needed to be covered by June\\n15.Multiple sources report that a number of these deliveries had not been completed by close of business June 16.\\nMost or all of the transactions reported in recent days at $370-380/st FOB New Orleans are accounted for in efforts by traders to find prompt cover for H1 June shorts. Meanwhile, prompt granular urea barges available by the end of this month have sold as low as $343-346/st FOB, but most business appears to be in the $350s/st FOB this week.\\nBy the end of the week, prior sales of early July granular barges at $350-353/st FOB were a memory, and H1 July business was cited around $310/st FOB and physical offers through the FIS service were down to $303/st FOB.\\nPrilled urea has sold at New Orleans this week at $310-315/st FOB.\\nChina Oil\\'s pamanax of Chinese granular urea will not reach New Orleans until the first 10 days of July, not in June as has been claimed elsewhere.\\nThe spot lineups for the US June and July now also include 107,000 mt of granular urea divided between four cargos loading from Algeria. The importers are Ameropa arriving June 25 with 23,000 mt, Trammo\\narriving June 27 with 30,000 mt, Indagro with 27,000 mt in the first two weeks of July and Koch with 27,000 mt in 2H July.\\nA rumored Gavilon cargo of Chinese granular for July arrival proved incorrect.\\nUS S Plains: More rain coming, but prices rise\\nGranular urea truckloads have sold as high as $410/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River, even though another 5-10 inches of rain is predicted for Oklahoma and Arkansas this week. Texas already has seen heavy rains this week.\\nUrea prices are rising despite the poor weather outlook because retailers expect substantial demand wherever conditions permit as soon as the storm passes.\\nPredictions over when barge travel along the Arkansas River will return to normal are increasingly negative. Travel through to Inola Oklahoma may not be restored for at least two weeks, according to various distributors in the region. Meanwhile, distributors are reduced to buying truckloads from terminals along the lower Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans, and driving product 25 st at a time to enduser markets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Texas.\\nUS Midwest: Wet weather prevents demand spike\\nEven though there is plenty of top-dress demand for corn yet to be satisfied, wet weather continues to slow applications. As a result pricing is far from keeping pace with recent spot costs out of the barge market. Early this week granular urea still was selling from river terminals in Iowa and Illinois at $370/st FOB, $5/st or more below FOB New Orleans quotes.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Diversions of vessels not alarming buyers\\nThe diversions of vessels carrying granular urea originally intended for Brazil from the Middle East and North Africa to the US has yet to impact Brazilian buyers\\' willingness to pay up to secure additional material.\\nOffers in the low $320s/mt CFR tabled by sellers at the end of last week failed to elicit firm buying interest. Importers indicate that quotes marginally below $320/mt CFR are currently available, despite the\\nrecent increase in freights for large carriers loading from the Middle East and other regional sources.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Regional demand supports exports\\nWhile down on the March volume, April exports of urea from Belarus identified by customs via GTIS close to 6,000 mt were up on April 2014. The entire quantity was delivered to Poland.\\nThis lifted January-April exports to 151,000 mt, up by a full 221% on the prior year. Poland accounted for 60,000 mt, Germany for 24,000 mt and Lithuania for 15,000 mt.\\nRussia: Exports of urea through April down by 19.3%\\nCompetition from other sources such as China in Q1 saw Russian urea exports as identified by customs via GTIS drop by 19.3% to 1.39 million mt in the first four months of 2015.\\nThe firmer stance on pricing adopted by Chinese sellers did however help to trigger Russian April exports of 364,000 mt, down by a mere 0.8% on April 2014. Deliveries to Mexico, partly replacing Chinese granular and Ukrainian prills of 49,000 mt were up by 68% on April 2014. Deliveries to Brazil were down by 3.2% to 42,000 mt but exports to Canada of 28,500 mt were up sharply on the prior year. Deliveries to Turkey of a mere 20,000 mt were down by 70% due to competition from China and Iran.\\nBrazil accounted for 277,000 mt out of the January-April volume, down by 14% on the same period in 2014. Deliveries to the US of 158,000 mt were down by 33.2% but shipments to Germany of 158,000 mt were up by a substantial 53%. Despite the April surge, Mexico accounted for 76,000 mt in January-April, down by 53% on the first four months of 2014. Deliveries to Turkey of 45,000 mt were down by 70%.\\nBlack Sea: Traders hold off despite limited availability\\nTraders are in no rush to add Black Sea prilled tonnage for June and July despite lower offers from producers and marketers. Offers to secure repeat business in the low $290s/mt FOB have yet to trigger significant buying interest.\\nPaper markets are also indicative of subdued activity ahead of tomorrow\\'s tender in India. Firm offers for July positions from Yuzhnyy that were posted at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $290/mt FOB attracted bids at $285/mt FOB while the bid-offer spread for August was $280-$285/mt FOB.\\nThe lineup for June loading is close to 72,000 mt following the addition of the Dreymoor vessel to load for NF for Italy:\\nEUROPE\\nSpain: March imports up\\nImports of urea by Spain identified by Eurostat via GTIS in March of 82,400 mt were up by 14.6% on March 2014, but Q1 imports of 307,800 mt nevertheless lagged Q1 2014 by 4.16%.\\nRussia accounted for 15,500 mt of the March volume, up by 174% on March 2014 and deliveries from Ukraine were up from zero to 14,000 mt. Arrivals from Germany were up by 108% to 22,200 mt but arrivals from Egypt were down by 72.6% to a mere 4,200 mt.\\nAlgeria accounted for 67,400 mt out of the Q1 2015 volume, up by 146% on the prior year while arrivals from Germany were up by 24.8% to 46,000 mt.\\nRussia accounted for 31,000 mt and Ukraine for 28,600 mt. Deliveries from Egypt were down by 80% to 15,000 mt and arrivals from the UAE were down to zero from 30,000 mt in Q1 2014.\\nRomania: Q1 exports down\\nRomanian exports of urea continued to fall in Q1 2015, with the 44,500 mt exported in the quarter identified by Eurostat via GTIS down by 77% on Q1 2014. March exports of a mere 12,800 mt were down by 84.5% on March 2014, and were shipped almost entirely to nearby, inland markets.\\nSerbia accounted for 19,500 mt of the Q1 volume, up by 52%, but other markets registered significant declines. Shipments to the US dropped from 51,000 mt in Q1 2014 to zero in 2015 and deliveries to Turkey were down from 37,600 mt to 2,900 mt.\\nGermany: Urea Q1 exports lower but imports are up\\nExports of urea from Germany identified via Eurostat via GTIS were down by 5.8% through Q1 while imports registered an increase of 11.25%.\\nMarch exports of 76,200 mt were off by 12.5% and Q1 exports of 223,400 mt were off by 5.8%. The UK took delivery of 35,100 mt in the quarter, down by 23% while shipments to Canada of 33,000 mt were up by 50% and deliveries to Poland of 23,000 mt were down by 13.5%.\\nMarch imports of 87,800 mt were up by 22.8% on the prior year with deliveries from Iran of 19,700 mt up from zero and arrivals from Belarus up from 3,000 mt to 18,300 mt. Russia accounted for 16,700 mt, down by 45.8%.\\nQ1 imports of 257,000 mt were up by 11.25%. Russian arrivals of 98,000 mt remained in the lead, but were off by 4.5%. Deliveries from the Netherlands of 33,000 mt were down by 25% while arrivals from Belarus of 30,400 mt were up by 402%.\\nCroatia: Q1 exports down on 2014\\nCroatian exports of urea in Q1 2015 of 64,100 mt identified by customs via GTIS were down by 28.6% on the Q1 2014 volume. Serbia accounted for 28,600 mt, followed by Italy with 9,800 mt and Austria with 9,600 mt. Exports to Turkey were not registered in Q1 but these will appear April onwards following numerous small sales of prills, mainly to industrial customers.\\nUK: Urea imports up through April\\nUrea imports by the UK in April as identified by customs via GTIS of 44,800 mt were up by 43.3% on April 2014 and January-April imports of 323,500 mt were up by 44.2% on the same period in the prior year.\\nGermany accounted for 19,100 mt of the April volume, up by 45% on April 2014 while deliveries from Netherlands of 10,000 mt were up by 51%. Arrivals from Poland of 3,600 mt were down by 50%.\\nRussian arrivals in January-April of 80,400 mt were up by 142% and shipments originating in Netherlands of 57,800 mt were up by 42.3%. Deliveries from Germany of 51,500 mt were off by 3% while arrivals from Egypt of 27,400 mt were up by 5.3%. Arrivals from Qatar and Algeria of 24,200 mt and 24,000 mt were up from zero in the prior year.\\nNetherlands: Urea Q1 exports up sharply\\nExports of urea from the Netherlands identified by Eurostat via GTIS in Q1 2015 of 607,500 mt were up by a massive 88% on Q1 2014.\\nMarch exports of 141,300 mt were up by 6.7%. March deliveries to Belgium of 24,000 mt were up by 27.7% and deliveries to Spain were up by 32%.\\nBelgium was also the biggest outlet for Q1 exports with 108,000 mt while Germany accounted for 80,000 mt, the UK for 76,400 mt and France for 68,500 mt.\\nItaly: Prompt demand tapers off as season ends\\nDemand for prompt positions of granular urea has tapered off in Italy as application for corn has essentially ended. Buyers are concentrating on vacation-plans rather than urea purchasing at present.\\nThe flurry of activity in March and April is already reflected in March import data provided by Eurostat via GTIS. March urea imports of 113,000 mt were up by 32.8% on March 2014 with Iran taking the lead with 26,300 mt, up from zero. Deliveries from Ukraine of 24,600 mt were down by 10.4% but arrivals from Russia of 23,600 mt were up by 322% on March 2014.\\nQ1 imports of 246,600 mt were nevertheless down by 18.2% on Q1 2014. Ukraine accounted for 66,600 mt, down by 31.4% but Russia was up by a massive 485% on the prior year to reach 56,400 mt and deliveries from Iran were up from zero to 31,000 mt. Egypt continued to suffer from limited availability and saw shipments drop by 80% to 23,300 mt. Deliveries from China were up from zero to 17,400 mt while Croatian imports dived by 71.5% to 9,800 mt.\\nFrance: Trade in granular subdued and imports slow\\nTrades in granular urea in France remains slow as importers hold off on forward purchasing. Trades are suggested by suppliers around an even €300/mt FCA, but distributors contend that offers closer to €290/mt FCA are freely available for the summer months.\\nImports of urea in April identitied by Eurostat via GTIS close to 160,000 mt were meanwhile down by about 13% on April 2014. Imports from Algeria of 25,700 mt were down marginally on March 2014, while imports from Oman and Kuwait jumped from zero to 24,000 mt and 21,000 mt, respectively.\\nJanuary-April imports of 544,000 mt were down by about 11% on the same period in 2014 but deliveries from Algeria of 123,000 mt were up by 7.1%. Arrivals\\nfrom Russia of 72,500 mt were down by 43.6% and shipments of 52,500 mt from Netherlands were off by 31%. Deliveries from Egypt of 41,500 mt were down by 69%.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nAlgeria: Sorfert sees regular output, more nominations\\nSorfert reports regular output of urea following the May closure due to technical issues, and the producer\\'s shipping programme for June continues to build, albeit at a relatively slow pace.\\nFollowing shipments of around 100,000 mt in May, the producer has loaded/accepted nominations for six vessels for a total close to 75,000 mt from contract holders Indagro (27,800 mt), Koch (16,000 mt), Nitron (15,400 mt plus 6,600 mt), Keytrade (4,000 mt) and Helm (3,400 mt) to load in June.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: MoA awards Dreymoor, issues new tender\\nThe MoA elected to award the June 9 tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 18,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags to Dreymoor at the trader\\'s lowest offers in the session based on 270 days credit. A new tender for 48,000 mt granular urea plus 12,000 prilled urea in bags is set to close June 29.\\nDreymoor booked the granular urea in the June 9 session at $347.26/mt CFR and the prills at $345.86/mt CFR, both inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nThe June 29 tender requests offers for the tonnage to be available in Sri Lanka for local distribution in bags by the end of September, and also includes a requirement for TSP and MOP.\\nPakistan: Fertilizers exempt from added tax\\nFurther to the June 9 update regarding the possible 1% increase in the import tariff for fertilizers for 2015- 2016, news from Pakistan indicates that the government has elected not to include Agricultural inputs - including fertilizers - in the proposed tariff increase. The tax on imported urea will therefore remain unchanged at 1%.\\nTCP tenders for the additional 150,000 mt cleared for import by the ECC are meanwhile yet to be issued.\\nIndia: STC floats urea tender to close June 19\\nThe long awaited tender for urea by STC to complement prior IPL purchases was issued June 12. The session calls for offers for an unspecified quantity of urea to load by July 27. Offers are to be submited by 11:00hrs Indian Standard Time on June 19 and are to remain valid through June 23.\\nIndian urea producer National Fertilizers Ltd. has meanwhile reported that its 510,000 mt/year Bathinda urea plant in Punjab that closed down for maintenance May 11 resumed production June 7.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Corn application set to taper off\\nDomestic prices for prilled urea are relatively stable but are expected to ease into July when application for corn will end. Trades in northern China are reported at RMB 1,700-1,730/mt ($274-279/mt) EXW\\nwhile business was done in Shanxi at RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) FCA.\\nOffers for prills for export were available at RMB 1,750/mt CPT into main northern ports, indicative of an export value around $307/mt FOB plus costs/margins to intermediaries.\\nTrades into regional markets such as Taiwan and Vietnam were nevertheless reported at netbacks down to about $295/mt FOB, but these are widely expected to be short sales by traders expecting a softer forward market once domestic demand for corn application eases.\\nTrades in granular positions in Shanxi were concluded above those for prills, with parcels changing hands at RMB 1,680/mt ($271/mt) FCA, suggesting export values at a mere $3/mt premium on prilled values. Netbacks on recent export deals are around $307/mt FOB for regular quality while premium granular quality has traded again above the $310/mt FOB marker.\\nInventories at ports are also stable on last week with about 300,000 mt indicated available for shipment from Yantai and Quinhuangdao with the majority in the form of granular urea.\\nExporters and traders are busy formulating strategies for the June 19 STC tender in India that permits loading through July 27. Mainstream offers are expected to be based on netbacks to producers above $305/mt FOB, but some traders may opt to consider taking short positions at returns down into the $290s/mt FOB. Freights for the supramax and panamax segments are up further over the last two weeks, suggesting rates closer to $15/mt rather than $10/mt for fast ports on East Coast India.\\nNew Zealand: Ballance in talks with suppliers\\nBallance Agri-Nutrients has been in discussions with suppliers pursuant to a June 17 request for offers for around 25,000 mt granular urea for July shipment. A deal for the cargo to load from Malaysia or Indonesia has been suggested, but could not be verified with the importer at press time.\\nTaiwan: TFC awards June 15 tender\\nThe June 15 TFC tender for 6,000 mt prilled urea for June or early July loading is reported to have resulted in an award to a trader offering Chinese urea around $318-320/mt CFR. The price suggested reflects a producer netback marginally above $295/mt FOB if loaded from a northern port in China.\\nImports of urea in April ascertained by customs via GTIS of a mere 7,500 mt were down by 60% on April 2014. Deliveries from China in April accounted for 7,300 mt. The April volume brought January-April imports to 35,600 mt, down by close to 50% on the same period in 2014, with China supplying 34,700 mt.\\nVietnam: More Indonesian granular urea trades\\nKoch is linked with sales of about 20,000 mt granular urea from Kaltim production for June/July loading to importers in Vietnam. A further deal for 10,000 mt is being negotiated.\\nExact details on the transactions were not released, but the sales were reported concluded marginally below $330/mt CFR, to be shipped in lots of 6-10,000 mt each.\\nAn offer for Chinese prills are suggested available for a small 3,000 mt lot from a Korean trader down to $310/mt CFR while parcels of 6-7,000 mt are on offer around $315/mt CFR, in line with this week\\'s sale in Taiwan.\\nSouth Korea: Namhae to test prilled values\\nNamhae will be seeking to improve on offers submitted to TFC in Taiwan for prilled urea around $317/mt CFR when tendering to buy 6,000 mt prills via tender June 19.\\nSouth Korean imports of urea in May 2015 registered by customs via GTIS of 56,500 mt, all from China, were meanwhile up by 3.5% on May 2014. This brought the January-May 2015 volume to 376,000 mt, up by 4% on the same months in 2014.\\nChina accounted for 346,400 mt of the\\n2015 total, up by 24%, while deliveries from Qatar of 25,000 mt were down by 57.6%.\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

It is expected to achieve returns above $180/mt FOB following 36,000 mt sales to Helm and Koch at the end of April priced just below that marker.\\nGrodnoAzot reportedly managed to achieve $170/mt FOB in its 25,000 mt June 12 export tender. Some tonnage is suggested destined for France while the balance will be loaded to nearby markets from the plant by rail.\\nUS movement of UAN continues to disappoint, but the culprit still is wet weather. Assuming conditions improve again before the corn grows too tall, UAN applications still could meet expectations, but summer fill orders likely will be delayed while retailers and distributors are uncertain about their carryover volumes.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nAt least 36,000 mt caprolactam grade AS has been sold by Chinese suppliers to Koch and Trammo with some small container business to Ameropa this week. The Koch tonnage will likely be directed to Indonesia against previous sales to Gresik.\\nPetrokimia Gresik is seeking further product and has issued a tender closing June 22 for 10-15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival.\\nIn the Black Sea steel grade AS values have declined at least $5/mt on a reported 4,000 mt purchase by Mekatrade. Turkey has been suggested as the cargo destination.\\nEurochem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, possibly to Gubretas in combination with 25,000 mt DAP. No further details are known. Turkish caprolactam grade AS prices are pegged in the high $160s/mt CFR duty paid.\\nEuropean caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nFSU suppliers continue to aim for higher netbacks from key markets such as Brazil and Turkey, but sales around an even $210/mt FOB and marginally higher are so far limited to smaller parcels for North Africa.\\nSuggestions that Brazilian buyers had concluded parcles of AN in combination with phosphates and urea at prices providing suppliers with netbacks above $215/mt FOB for AN could not be verified.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Barges flat, but pressure from imports\\nUAN barge trades have not been the priority for up-river buyers due to continuing rain in the Midwest. However, once further demand emerges for corn application sales of full tows should re-emerge. As a result nearby indications are unchanged from last week.\\nMeanwhile, Agronova is loading 40,000 mt of UAN-32 July 1-10 from the Baltic for the US Gulf. The cargo is destined for Gavilon under a previously agreed supply arrangement. Market sources suggested the delivered price paid by Gavilon will result in a cost in a barge as low as $197/st FOB New Orleans..\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers put pressure on prompt market\\nAs expected, lower fill offers that include delivery dates as early as July have begun to drag down UAN values in the Midwest. Prompt UAN is on offer from some river terminals as low as $9.06/unit FOB this week, while even the high end of the market has fallen to about $9.38/unit from some inland locations.\\nThe new prompt price range is down roughly $0.20/unit at both ends compared to prior weeks. This follows reports earlier this month of Q3 fill offers at $7.66-7.81/unit FOB in the region. While the volume available at this level is relatively modest, it means the prompt market likely will decline further as June comes an end.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot sells 25,000 mt UAN-32\\nContrary to earlier reports, GrodnoAzot said it sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 following its June 12 export tender. The product to load onto vessels was reported secured at $170/mt FOB, destined for France while tonnage destined for Ukraine will be loaded from the plant by rail.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Values stable on small number of sales\\nSales into France continue to be slow around the €196-197/mt FCA marker. Some traders continue to push for €200/mt FCA but so far this has not been successful.\\nDemand from farmers is expected to decrease over the next few weeks as their focus is shifted to harvesting the winter wheat crop. A lack of rainfall is causing some concern, with wheat and rapeseed yields in the central part of the country down 10-15% from last year’s high level with the potential to decrease further if rain does not fall over the coming weeks.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir issues 10,000 mt UAN tender\\nAbu Qir issued an export tender closing June 23 for 10,000 mt UAN-32 for prompt loading.\\nHelm and Koch secured a total of 36,000 mt from the supplier at the end of April, priced just below $180/mt FOB.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: More Chinese AS booked for US Gulf\\nA panamax of granular ammonium sulphate plus other products is loading this month from China for Gavilon. Specific volume breakdowns were not clear at press time, but in addition to AS, the vessel is carrying industrial grade AS and phosacid carried in drums.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Number of caprolactam grade AS deals fixed\\nEuropean caprolactam grade AS has been sold into Brazil at $175/mt CFR while Chinese product has achieved values in the high $160s/mt CFR.\\nGranular AS prices are pegged at $235/mt CFR.\\nThe latest ANDA data reveals January-May imports of both grades AS grew 15% to 845,731 mt. Recent issues in gaining access to credit have taken their toll though, as April and May import figures are down 24% and 17% respectively.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Mekatrade buys steel grade parcel\\nMekatrade has reportedly secured a small Black Sea steel grade AS parcel at $127-128/mt FOB, possibly for sale into Turkey.\\nNo caprolactam grade AS sales are believed concluded.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: EuroChem concludes AS sale\\nEuroChem has fixed a 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS ex-Antwerp sale into Turkey, in combination with 25,000 mt DAP, possibly to Gubretas. No further details are known.\\nTurkish caprolactam grade AS prices are pegged in the high $160s/mt CFR duty paid.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Caprolactam grade AS sales concluded\\nChinese caprolactam grade AS has changed hands at $133-135/mt FOB with 26,000 mt reported sold to Koch by several suppliers to cover prior business concluded in Indonesia.

Future price direction remains unclear and a number of market participants are holding off from concluding deals in the meantime.\\nIn anticipation of further purchases by Koch in the Black Sea and Baltic for July lifting, Yara has sought cover for 20,000 mt from several Baltic suppliers at an even $400/mt FOB, up $10/mt on the previous index. This was in response to a recent ammonia plant fire at Yara’s Brunsbüttel facility in Germany which affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire remains unclear.\\nBlack Sea activity proved calmer with no new cargoes believed traded. Netbacks declined to the mid\\n$370s/mt FOB in recent sales by Trammo into Turkey and Morocco with downward price pressure from both buying nations forecast to continue. OCP is still pushing for values at a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny equivalent although Black Sea suppliers are so far refusing to accept the demands for lower prices.\\nSuppliers east of Suez have maintained upward price pressure with the presumed start-up the Safco V granular urea plant at the end of June certain to reduce available merchant ammonia volumes. As yet the vast majority of Asian buyers have resisted such price attempts, with South Korean buyers still claiming no interest in additional cargoes outside contract volumes until the end of July at the earliest.\\nSouth east Asian values have already noted a $11/mt uptick to $448/mt CFR following CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award to Petrokimia Gresik. This is likely a reaction to the high-priced 20,000 mt Kaltim sale to Mitsui at $437.50 FOB last week. It is suggested this cargo may be used against a reported sale to Orica around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery.\\nIndian ammonia demand will be the key to future price development east of Suez. Satisfactory monsoon rainfall is being recorded for June but drier conditions in July could prompt a build-up of DAP inventories, possibly lowering ammonia demand. Negotiations on Q3 phosphoric acid prices are on-going.\\nIn the US Gulf, CF is receiving ammonia through Yara that is enabling it to begin test runs on it new urea train at Donaldsonville Louisiana. That plant will run on imported ammonia until first half 2016 when the planned ammonia unit at the site comes on line.\\nNegotiations on the Tampa July price tag are yet to begin in earnest as both parties wait for the market direction to become clearer. Various sources have mooted a rollover from June’s $450/mt CFR Tampa price tag.\\nFill offers for ammonia to be delivered ahead of the fall application season in inland US reported earlier this week by Fertilizer Week were fairly aggressive at around $540/st FOB in the Midwest from a limited number of suppliers. The pricing suggests suppliers have seen greater than normal carryover from the spring season.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Koch still seeking Black Sea and Baltic cargoes\\n∙Trammo sells to Petkim in low $400/mt CFR\\n∙OCP buys 25,000 mt from Trammo in low $400s/mt CFR\\n∙Australia\\'s Orica buys 19,000 mt from a trader around $500/mt CFR\\n∙CJ Indonesia awards tender to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR\\n∙July Tampa price negotiations to start soon\\nShort term outlook\\nFurture price direction remains unclear with a combination of price increases and declines noted east and west of Suez.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nDAP production remains suspended at GCT\\'s Gabes plant as rock supplies are subject to further disruptions, limiting ammonia imports. For July OCP is expected to place greater emphasis on MAP/DAP production over NPKs to cover commitments in Brazil and Europe although demand in Brazil remains extremely\\nsubdued. Nevertheless, OCP will be hoping to balance granulation with steady Indian phosacid shipments but acid volumes will depend on the eventual price settled for Q3. Negotiations for this are ongoing.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were overall fairly stable and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nTampa: July pricing focus of market attention\\nMosaic is expected to fight hard for a further cut in the Tampa ammonia price tag for its July deliveries. Market watchers are predicting that flat pricing from the June agreement of $450/mt CFR may be the best Yara can hope for, even with more rumors of possible curtailments in August in Trinidad and Tobago . Expectations are for a Tampa July agreement next week.\\nUS NOLA: Returns on ammonia barges down\\nPossible returns on ammonia barges and railcars loading for inland destinations from the US Gulf have declined, and are indicated within a substantially lower range than seen in prior weeks. Much of this decline is due to fill indications in the US interior that are $40-50/st lower than in prior weeks.\\nFor now returns on spot sales up river and quotes based on import costs suggest a range of $430-$460/st FOB New Orleans, with the midpoint of the range declining about $35/st from prior weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Fill offers cited below cash market\\nDistributors in the Midwest claim Koch Nitrogen is offering fill ammonia for delivery in time for the fall season at $535-540/st FOB terminals. This would be $50-60/st below cash costs for the current season, and reflects the bearish attitude reported from farmers and retailers for the upcoming crop year.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Yara buys 20,000 mt at $400/mt FOB\\nYara has secured 20,000 mt ammonia from Baltic suppliers at a reported $400/mt FOB for July lifting. The cargo will be taken to Yara’s European units in Sweden, Finland and France after a fire at Yara’s ammonia plant in Brunsbüttel, Germany late last week affected its own supply chain. The impact of the fire is still unclear.\\nKoch is still reported negotiating the purchase of a further 40,000 mt cargo with Baltic suppliers for July lifting.\\nBlack Sea: Netbacks down on CFR sales at lower prices\\nBlack Sea trade has been extremely quiet with prices under downward pressure.\\nA recent sale to Turkey’s Petkim points to Yuzhnny values in the $370s/mt FOB while a 25,000mt Trammo sale to OCP possibly off the Touraine is reported providing netbacks in a similar range.\\nTrammo will lift a further 5-8,000 mt ex-DnieproAzot on the Marycam Swan late June or on the Touraine early July pursuant to a deal concluded several weeks ago around $390/mt FOB. It is unclear where the balance tonnage will be sourced from.\\nTrammo’s Sylvie which be loaded with 23,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot June 26 under a product swap with Ameropa will likely be directed to buyers east of Suez under spot and contract business.\\nKoch is reported back in negotiations with Black Sea suppliers for a 40,000 mt cargo for July lifting. The trader\\'s Jenny N will lift a similar volume June 25 for the US.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Petkim buys small parcel from Trammo\\nTurkey\\'s Petkim has secured 6,000 mt from Trammo for mid-July delivery in the low $400s/mt CFR. This is at least $8/mt down on previous sales done in the country to Bagfas and Igsas.\\nBagfas is reported in the market for another 6-7,000 mt for July delivery.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nTunisia: Short term ammonia demand unchanged\\nTunisian ammonia demand is unlikely to significantly improve over the coming weeks. There is still no reported DAP production as Gabes and rock supply is still subject to some disruption.\\nMorocco: OCP keeps pressure on Black Sea suppliers\\nOCP continues to push for ammonia cargoes below $400/mt CFR equating to a $350/mt FOB Yuzhnny netback.\\nTrammo\\'s recent 25,000 mt sale to OCP off the Touraine for early July delivery was reported fixed in the low $400s/mt CFR.\\nMiddle East: Scarce activity as Ramadan begins\\nRamadan observance commenced this week with limited Middle East activity reported.\\nAll Sabic units are reported running as normal. The Safco V urea plant continues to undergo trials and given no further updates it is assumed that full capacity production is still expected to start at the end of June.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand flat and prices steady\\nIndian demand is reported flat week-on-week with prices unchanged at $415-450/mt CFR.\\nIFFCO will take delivery of a 40,000 mt contract cargo from Ameropa off the Clipper Mars early July.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nAustralia: Orica linked to 19,000 mt spot purchase\\nAustralian ammonium nitrate (AN) producer Orica has reportedly secured 19,000 mt ammonia from a trader around $500/mt CFR for first half July delivery owing to a technical issue at its plant.\\nMitsui could conceivably be the provider of the cargo after being awarded Kaltim’s 20,000 mt June 11 sales- tender at $437.50/mt FOB for loading end June.\\nYara’s 759,000 mt/year Pilbara ammonia facility is running normally after another technical issue interrupted production early June.\\nTaiwan: Buyers resist potential price increases\\nTaiwanese buyers report suppliers’ attempts to push prices up are gaining little traction.\\nDemand remains weak from industrial consumers while fertilizer usage will decrease over the coming two months during the off-season.\\nTFC received one 23,000 mt contract cargo discharged June 15 priced at $430-440/mt CFR with a similar sized cargo to follow July 20.\\nIndonesia: Petrokimia Gresik linked to CJ tender\\nAn award in CJ Indonesia\\'s June 16 import tender for 6,000 mt is reported to Petrokimia Gresik at $448/mt CFR. Delivery was requested July 28-30. The product will likely be sourced from Pupuk Kaltim.\\nThe buyer’s May 25 tender was awarded to Yara at $437/mt CFR.\\nSouth Korea: Imports down on lower contract deliveries\\nSouth Korea ammonia imports for May down 14% at 74,030 mt reflect continued weak demand from industrial consumers.\\nJanuary-May figures show an almost identical picture for imports, down 15% at 435,259 mt.\\nContract ammonia deliveries have been reduced in 2015 owing to an expected decrease in demand with any urgent needs covered by spot purchases from Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.\\nImports from Australia for the first five months of this year fell 1% to 179,548 mt while offtake from Saudi Arabia was down 71% at 69,617 mt. Imports from Indonesia climbed 26% at 52,307 mt and 196% from Malaysia at 47,372 mt.\\nSouth Korea: Additional cargoes still a possibility\\nNamhae and SFC report a quiet week in ammonia but suppliers seek purchasing interest in spot cargoes for the short term. Both buyers insist they will not consider additional parcels outside contract commitments until late July/early August at the earliest owing to current high inventories.\\nContract prices remain unchanged around $450/mt CFR with SFC to receive a total of 23,000 mt from Trammo at the end of July in two shipments.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

In India and Brazil where both markets should be at the height of their import season, the impasse between buyers and sellers continues.\\nPakistan has seen further buying interest this week with a sale from China and Saudi Arabia reported but with a higher price paid for the Chinese material, thereby bucking the normal trend. Much of the Chinese DAP coming into Pakistan is sourced from the Hubei Yihua plant and is well respected in the marketplace and the gap in price between the various origins is beginning to narrow accordingly. Firmer freights from China have supported a drive for higher prices also.\\nAlthough indicating higher prices in Pakistan and achieving some increase compared with previous sales, Chinese suppliers are unlikely to achieve a similar increase in India. Indian importers continue to put pressure on suppliers to reduce prices from the $480/mt CFR level by $7-10/mt to a range of $470-475/mt CFR. The rupee has been particularly volatile this week, spiking to INR64.3 at the beginning of the week to INR63.6 against the dollar at presstime today. The latter rate raises importers\\' margins at $480/mt CFR (and a MRP of INR 24,000/mt) from 1% to 2% but this still excludes any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.\\nMuch depends on the monsoon but in theory India still has substantial tonnes to buy for the Rabi season despite the large quantities already booked to date. Low stocks and low production levels have prompted the greater H1 volumes of import tonnage booked. It can slow down its import programme and is likely to do so as it watches the monsoon but will not want to delay too late to avoid a similar situation to 2014 when a last minute surge in demand coincided with the Chinese autumn season and prompted a spike in\\nprice. Nevertheless China, although currently in the peak export season with no alternative afforded in the domestic season or indeed much outside the Indian subcontinent, can play the waiting game also and it still remains to be seen who buckles first.\\nThe Brazilian market remains very quiet as farmers assimilate the new Harvest Plan with its additional funding but with the higher interest rates that go with it. The weak crop prices are a real problem and with a higher cost of credit, farmers may continue to cut back on phosphate usage. This week\\'s ANDA data make gloomy reading with a drop of 26% in consumption of P2O5 in May, the largest monthly reduction to date this year and well below the level of May consumption in previous years. Here buyers are also resisting suppliers\\' attempts to drive prices higher for July and the impasse is expected to last for another week or more before one or other caves in.\\nMosaic will continue to ship to India, and presumably add cargoes for Brazil once a price agreement is found. However, the key for the producer remains the domestic market even though seasonal demand has been met. Mosaic is expected to begin railing refill tonnes to its consignment warehouses in July, and these volumes will reduce its need to search for further export opportunities. So far competing phosphates from China or Morocco are not on the radar for the US Gulf, although Russian suppliers appear willing to accept US returns on small volumes.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Two new sales reported for Pakistan in mid-upper $480s/mt CFR\\n∙Lithuanian DAP sold into Turkey at around $510/mt CFR\\n∙Phosacid negotiations start but no agreement\\n∙Demand in South Africa as Moroccan and Saudi tonnes sold\\n∙Mosaic will refil US domestic maw over summer.\\nSulphur\\n∙Global spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards march, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq\\'s latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.\\nAmmonia\\n∙Lack of clarity over price direction continues to stall ammonia activity. Despite weak demand east of\\nSuez, prices edged up slightly on CJ Indonesia’s reported tender award at $448/mt CFR.\\nShort Term Outlook\\nThe Brazilian market continues to disappoint and although there are some still anticipating a last minute surge in buying for the September season, current economics would suggest otherwise with more of the same hand to mouth buying expected going forward. With US domestic prices also attracting no import interest for the coming months, the attention will focus on the Indian subcontinent to provide much of the activity over Q3 and probably the direction for the market. Both Brazil and India are needed to support the market during this period but without much impetus from either, prices may falter. So much therefore depends on the monsoon, even just from a psychological standpoint, as we head into Q3 and the start of the next round of import activity.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS S Plains: Wet weather halts further phosphate use\\nSoybean growers in the South are behind in their planting work due to flooding, and distributors predict many of those farmers will focus on planting before worrying about applying phosphate and potash. In some areas fertilizer applicators will follow the planters, but distributors do not report much demand from retailers.\\nNevertheless southern states to the east continue to attract new sales to retailers, and prices have not moved at the distributor level in a couple of weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Little movement expected ahead\\nDistributors do not expect to move much more phosphate in the coming days and weeks. Postings for DAP remain around $460/st FOB. Some barges still are discharging at northern terminals, and the supply chain in the region is ending the season with more carryover than normal, according to players throughout the region.\\nUS Tampa: Modest interest does little to support market\\nMosaic reported a further 17,000 mt of DAP sales this week to multiple Latin American markets. All of the material will load in July and was sold at $470-474/mt FOB Tampa, a $1/mt lower range than the prior couple of weeks.\\nMarkets in the Americas are generally relying on Brazil to set the price for any large purchases in coming weeks, but buyers in that market have not been able to reach a meeting of the minds with suppliers on price for forward purchases.\\nUS NOLA: Lack of interest in prompt DAP\\nPrompt inquiries are rare at this stage for DAP and MAP, although indications reported from suppliers are $415-425/st FOB. There is greater interest in forward DAP barges that would be available in the Gulf during September. However, at least one importer responded with bids basis open origin material at $440/st FOB for that month. So far there is no support for that price.\\nUS: DAP/MAP exports slightly better than steady\\nUS DAP/MAP exports during May were down modestly compared to May 2014, but not enough to change the trend for the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year through May with shipments moderately ahead of the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nMay 2015 exports of DAP/MAP were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared to 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5. Increases and decreases in shipments to traditional customers varied over the month, with the largest decrease seen in shipments to Canada, which fell to 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5 in May of 2014. The largest customers for US DAP/MAP in May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, DAP/MAP exports reached 1.98 million st (1.8 million mt) P2O5, compared to 1.78 million st (1.61 million mt) P2O5. Much of the year-over-year gain can be traced to shipments to India, which rose to 362,462 st P2O5 from 231,088 st P2O5 over the relevant periods. Other key customers for US DAP/MAP during the current fertilizer year through May were Brazil at 472,167 st (P2O5) and Canada at 287,065 st P2O5.\\nMexico: Fertinal committed through to September\\nDeliveries to Chile and the local market through June, July and August mean that Fertinal remains fully committed through to September. Production continues to return to normal.\\nFertinal is currently loading around 35,000 mt DAP, MAP and TSP on the Western Feodora for Chile. The balance of June production, estimated at around 70,000 mt and mostly DAP with some MAP, will be delivered into the local market, split between commitments of around 15,000 mt to NW Mexico and close to 20,000 mt delivered by truck and rail to nearby customers.\\nFor July Fertinal will load another 35,000 mt combination cargo for Chile with a second such cargo, due to load end July/early August. The balance of July\\'s production, estimated at around 70-75,000 mt, will be delivered into the local market.\\nAn estimated 40,000 mt will be delivered into NW Mexico in August and a further 35,000 mt Chilean vessel will load either late August or September. Depending on the timing of this last Chilean shipment, a trader has booked 30,000 mt Mexican MAP/DAP for likely shipment to South America.\\nProduction levels have been slowly but steadily improving, rising from a monthly output of 65,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP in May up to around 70,000 mt in June and a further increase in July/August expected to reach nearer 75,000 mt.\\nThe increase has been in part facilitated by the two supplementary rock cargoes booked from Senegal, covering the shortfall caused by previous technical issues in the mine curtailing production but which are now being resolved. The first of these cargoes arrived on the Cano at the end of May and the second will arrive on the Ultra Iris at the end of June. No further imported rock cargoes are planned at this time.\\nPrice levels for Mexican DAP and MAP have firmed up to $475-480/mt FOB with the higher price achievable in Chile where Fertinal has a freight advantage over other potential suppliers. Mexcian TSP is priced at around $385-390/mt FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Import interest wanes and prices stall\\nThe Brazilian import market remains very quiet with buyers resisting moves by suppliers to raise the price for MAP 11-52-0/12-52-0 above $500/mt CFR to $505-510/mt CFR, as is currently indicated for Russian and Moroccan product. As such the price range for this week has been assessed at $498-500/mt CFR.\\nOCP is currently in discussions with buyers for July shipments but as yet no tonnes have been placed.\\nDemand for Chinese 10-50-0 and 11-44-0 has started to ease off in China as few traders want to take positions for cargoes from mid July onwards for fear of both port congestion and demand worsening through August/September. As such prices in China for new sales of 11-44-0 for H2 July onwards have dropped off to $370-375/mt FOB giving landed prices sub $400/mt CFR depending on freight. For near term delivery into Brazil, prices are still in the low $400s/mt CFR.\\nYUC is producing granular 11-52-0, essentially for the Brazilian market, with its earliest shipment by the end of June and one cargo per month available through Q3 if needed.\\nHeavy congestion is being reported at Paranagua this week with delays of between 10-30 days reported at the fertilizer quays where a total of 24 vessels are expected, including 4 carrying MAP. At Santos, there is a\\ndelay of 11 days with 10 fertilizer vessels expected. Delays at the fertilizer terminals at the other main Brazilian ports are currently less than 5 days.\\nBrazil: ANDA data show 26% drop in May P2O5 use\\nThe latest ANDA data show a 19% drop in January-May P2O5 consumption with a 26% decline in May itself against 2014. The actual volume of P2O5 consumed over the full five months was the lowest since 2011.\\nImports of all phosphate fertilizers into Brazil fell by 27% year on year January-May with DAP down by 36% and MAP, SSP and TSP all down by 26-27% compared with the same period a year earlier. The import volume for this period was also 19% down on 2012.\\nBy contrast, Brazilian production of phosphate fertilizers rose by 4% in the first five months compared with the same period last year. Both MAP and TSP output increased by 7% year on year.\\nLooking at the demand/supply balance we can see that the availability to date appears to be in balance with demand. More costly credit lines and lower crop prices continue to cast a cloud across the whole fertilizer market. Brazilian corn prices continue to fall below cost of production levels, and are likely to move lower as\\nthe safrinha crop harvest rolls on. This is likely to see full season corn planting fall yet again once fieldwork begins in September and will continue to impact demand across the nutrients.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nFSU: Turkish sale netback in mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic\\nEuroChem sold 25,000 mt Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment at around $510/mt CFR cash duty free. With a freight rate in the mid $20s/mt, the netback is in the mid $480s/mt FOB Baltic.\\nNegotiations are ongoing for further sales into Turkey for July/August.\\nSales to nearby and domestic markets have left Belorechensk sold out until 15-20 July. For Kingisepp, a cargo for mid July is now available. EuroChem is indicating $505-510/mt CFR for July shipment to Brazil. At current freights this would netback to $484-489/mt FOB Baltic excluding trader\\'s margin but Brazilian buyers continue to balk at paying above $500/mt CFR.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: Sale of 20,000 mt Lithuanian DAP\\nEuroChem has sold a 25,000 mt cargo of Lithuanian DAP into Turkey for early July shipment, in combination with 15,000 mt AS. The price for the DAP is heard around $510/mt CFR duty free cash and the buyer, although not confirmed at presstime, is believed to be Gubretas.\\nGubretas would normally be receving regular supplies from Tunisia at this time but the DAP plant at Gabes is yet to restart production after the two month stoppage. An initial 20,000 mt DAP delivery was supplied by GCT at the end of May out of stocks at the Tunisian plant but until the plant resumes steady production, further deliveries into Turkey will remain suspended.\\nBuying has been subdued in Turkey since the IFA meeting when a flurry of DAP and NP cargoes were booked. To date up to 280,000 mt DAP has been booked. Assuming that the full quantity of 100,000 mt is shipped from Morocco, a further 100-120,000 mt DAP is still theoretically required, ideally for Q3 shipment, and buying activity should start to pick up over the coming weeks. Cargoes from Jordan and Lithuania, both duty free, are likely to cover any outstanding demand not met from Tunisia.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: New sales to Pakistan\\nMa\\'aden sold a cargo to Engro/Pakistan over the past week in the mid $480s/mt CFR for late June/early July shipment. As reported last week, Sabic also has a cargo booked for Pakistan, to United Agro, for July shipment, also priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR, giving an estimated netback into the mid $470s/mt FOB RAK.\\nSaudi DAP has become more competitive in Pakistan, priced at or even below prevailing Chinese prices from Hubei Yihua and as such, the Saudi market share has risen this year to just over 55% of the import market to date.\\nSabic reports two sales of MAP for July shipment to South Africa both priced in the mid $480s/mt FOB. The first 25,000 mt cargo is for loading on July 3 and the second 30,000 mt cargo on July 15. Netbacks on South African business from RAK are currently more attractive than for sales to Brazil.\\nThis brings Sabic\\'s sales for July to date to 85,000 mt DAP/MAP excluding any cargoes to its regular customers in India. As such Sabic is said to be sold out for July and indicating in the $490s/mt CFR India WC and Pakistan for August.\\nTunisia: Little change at Gabes\\nThe latest reports suggest that DAP production is yet to resume at Gabes due to further disruptions to rock supplies. Even though rock production has been resumed at the mines, there are still pockets of unrest disrupting the transport from the mines to some of the downstream plants. GCT had hoped to restart phosphoric acid production at the complex by the start of Ramadan but this does not appear to have been achieved as yet.\\nMorocco: OCP targets Brazil and Europe for July\\nBrazil and Europe, including Turkey, will be the target markets for Moroccan DAP and MAP in July. Price indications for Brazil are in the range of $505-510/mt CFR whereas for Europe OCP is quoting the same range as for June, around $510-515/mt FOB Morocco.\\nAs yet no sales for July have been booked in either market but OCP sold a second 30,000 mt MAP cargo to South Africa for end-June loading at a price said to be close to $490/mt FOB.\\nDemand in Southern Europe is starting to pick up and with no DAP currently coming out of Tunisia, additional sales opportunities for Morocco will be present over the coming weeks.\\nFor the Turkish market, OCP booked the first 30,000 mt DAP vessel against its agreement with Toros for up to 100,000 mt for June-September shipment. The vessel will load end June/early July.\\nPlans to load an 80,000 mt MAP/DAP vessel to the US in July are still under discussion and will depend on demand in the US. Prices at NOLA are still unattractive to potential off-shore suppliers, equating to around $450/mt CFR.\\nAs previously reported, OCP will ship a panamax to China at some time in Q3 against its government- government agreement but the actual date has not yet been fixed.\\nNPK sales to Nigeria are also under discussion for July and as yet no tonnes are believed to have been booked.\\nOCP will ship 75,000 mt TSP against awards in the recent Bangladesh private sector tender for Q3 shipment. As reported previously, the netback on this business is in the low $400s/mt FOB Morocco.\\nThe new 1 million mt DAP/MAP plant is still in the commissioning phase and is still scheduled to start commercial production in early Q3.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nBangladesh: Awards dominated by China\\nAlthough the final supplier details remain unconfirmed, awards for the 400,000 mt DAP in the Ministry of Agriculture\\'s recent private sector tender will be mostly covered from China. Just one cargo has been awarded to Quantum/Australia.\\nNetbacks for the lowest-priced DAP offered from the Hubei Dongsheng plant are sub $460/mt FOB, but this is not reflective of the Chinese market today and is believed to be a result of trader positioning rather than actual netbacks offered by the producer.\\nMost of the offers were at around $490/mt CFR which would give a straight netback to China in the upper\\n$460s depending on freight and excluding margins. The netback on the Australian cargo is reportedly in the low-to-mid $470s/mt FOB Townsville.\\nShipment has been requested by September.\\nIndia: Imports reach 1.45 million mt DAP in April/May\\nThe latest data released by the Department of Fertilizers show DAP imports for the first two months of the current fertilizer year, April/May, of 1.449 million mt. The breakdown by origin is as follows:\\n854,000 mt from China\\n338,000 mt from Saudi Arabia\\n172,000 mt from Russia\\n55,000 mt from the US\\n30,000 mt from Jordan\\nIn terms of importers over the April/May period, IFFCO and IPL received 383,000 and 279,000 mt respectively or some 46% of the total to date. Chambal, Kribhco and Zuari each took between 138-165,000 mt with the balance accounted for by TCL, Mosaic, Deepak, Shriram, PPL, MCFL and CIL.\\nIn terms of NP/NPK imports over the same two month period, IPL imported 124,000 mt with Deepak and Kribhco at 44,000 mt and 38,000 mt respectively.\\nOf this total, 148,000 mt NP/NPKs were sourced from Russia and the balance of 58,000 mt from China.\\nIndia: Up to 2.5 million mt DAP imports still needed\\nAdditional DAP cargoes have been added to the June line up over the past week bringing the new total to just over 1.2 million mt. Official DoF data show a further 1.45 million mt arriving through April/May (see separate update for further details). Together with the cargoes arriving through Q1, the total quantity imported for the Kharif season is now just short of 3 million mt.\\nFertilizer Week estimates that about 1.5 million mt remains outstanding against the MoU agreements for the current fertilizer year (excluding the recent PhosAgro agreement which combines NPKs and DAP). Whereas\\nthese agreements are not set in stone, we can assume that this quantity or thereabouts will be shipped over the forthcoming months to build up support for the Rabi season.\\nRabi consumption over the past four years has averaged 4.7 million mt. Taking the 1.5 million mt MoU tonnage together with domestic production between July-March of an estimated 2.7 million mt (based on 300,000 mt/month average), total availability will be around 4.2 million mt.\\nMuch depends on the level of Kharif consumption and the stocks that will remain by September. But given a healthy drawdown on inventory, this volume of 4.2 million mt would theoretically be insufficient to cover potential demand for the Rabi and leave some opening stock for the following year. It also assumes\\na comparatively robust domestic output which in reality may not be sustained through the whole period, particularly if H2 phosacid prices remain on the higher side.\\nTherefore additional spot imports over and above the MoU tonnes could be needed of as much as 1 million mt (up to 2.5 million mt in total with MoU tonnes) through H2 but with the overall quantity dependent on how the monsoon eventually progresses. Ideally the bulk of these tonnes should be shipped July- September. Doubts over the monsoon at this time last year led to a delay in purchasing and a consequent surge in last minute imports during September/October, coinciding with the Chinese domestic market and consequently pushing prices up.\\nIn 2014, a total of 1.23 million was imported into India in Q3, rising to 1.63 million mt in Q4, compared with 2.1 million and 747,000 mt in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively.\\nImporters will prefer to avoid a late surge this year but will also want to delay the next tranche of spot buying to a) guage the behaviour of the monsoon and b) push prices down in the near term to provide some cushioning against the current rupee volatility.\\nThe rupee has traded between 64.2 and 63.7 against the US dollar over the past few days as the currency markets speculate on US interest rates and the US Federal Reserve\\'s next move.\\nGiven a rate of INR 64 flat against the dollar and a maximum retail price of INR 24,000/mt, an import price of $480/mt CFR provides importers with a margin of barely 1% and does not include any provision for hedging or interest payments against delayed subsidies.\\nImporters therefore continue to push for numbers closer to $470/mt CFR which would provide a basic margin of 3%. Suppliers from China are resisting any move from current values, particularly in the light of the recent firming in freight rates.\\nPakistan: Engro buys Saudi DAP in mid $480s/mt CFR\\nEngro has purchased a cargo of DAP from Ma\\'aden at a price in the mid $480s/mt CFR for end June/early July arrival. Pakarab is linked with a Chinese cargo in the high $480s/mt CFR and Fauji is also expected to finalise a cargo for June/July shipment by the end of the week. Against its recent enquiry, it received prices in the mid-high $480s/mt CFR, mostly of Chinese origin.\\nEngro will have had three DAP cargoes loading in May/June, two from Ma\\'aden and one Chinese cargo from Trammo. The reason for the decision to buy a third cargo was to lock in additional prompt tonnes for delivery by July 1 ahead of the proposed import tax increase. The threat of such an increase has since receded as reported last week in Fertilizer Week.\\nSuppliers have increased their price ideas into Pakistan for July with Chinese offers now in the high\\n$480s/mt CFR, having moved up from the low $480s/mt CFR for June. One of the arguments cited by suppliers of Chinese DAP is the higher freight, now being indicated at around $19/mt, up by $2-3/mt on previous rates.\\nSaudi tonnage has become as competitive as Chinese in some instances and as a result, out of the cargoes booked for 2015 arrival, over 55% has been souced from Saudi Arabia to date with 35% from China. This is a reversal of the trend seen last year which saw the market dominated by Chinese imports.\\nIncluding the Fauji cargo not yet confirmed, close to 440,000 mt DAP has been booked for shipment into Pakistan this year and represents close to half the import quantity required for the year.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Higher prices achieved in Pakistan\\nFirmer freights have been one of the main arguments cited by Chinese suppliers in price discussions in Pakistan for July cargoes. One sale has been reported this week in the upper $480s/mt CFR Karachi, up from the low $480s/mt CFR previously, which at current freights of around $19/mt would netback to the high $460s/mt FOB, still within the current price range published in Fertilizer Week.\\nCurrent prices for sales into South and Southeastern Asia, excluding India, are in the range of $467-470/mt FOB. For India the range is between the low-upper $460s depending on whether to EC or WC and size of vessel.\\nIn India meanwhile the stalemate on price continues with buyers still pushing for a reduction of around $7- 10/mt in line with the rupee depreciation and suppliers maintaining a firm price nearer $480/mt CFR.\\nOf the 1.2 million mt in the line up to arrive into India in June, approximately 870,000 mt will have been shipped from China, a substantial quantity compared with previous years. It not only reflects the earlier start to the Indian DAP campaign due to lower opening stocks but also the increased flexibility afforded to Chinese suppliers following the removal of the export window.\\nOne question frequently asked is how much DAP the Chinese producers can store at the ports. This is particularly relevant given the current situation in India at the moment with buyers holding off while they gauge the progression of the monsoon and at the same time put pressure on the price.\\nPrior to 2014 producers were bound by the rigid export windows and therefore tried to push as much into bonded warehouses as possible ahead of the closure of the export windows. The time taken to transport product along the Yangtse river, for example, and into the ports, was also much longer, requiring more planning by producers.\\nThis year there is no need for the bonded warehouses and the speed and efficiency not only of the transport to the ports but the throughput at the ports has meant that for many producers it is merely a few days from leaving the plant to being available for export at the seaports.\\nA lower volume of other commodities has also freed up capacity at the ports for fertilizers. As such producers can be more flexible and act at relatively short notice on export orders. This is partly why inventory levels reported at the ports this year have been comparatively low. In terms of actual storage, it is estimated that as much as 1 million mt DAP could be stored if necessary.\\nAvailability for 11-44-0 from mid July onwards has increased as traders back away from taking positions for the Brazilian market for H1 July onwards. As such prices have weakened to the $370-375/mt FOB range for this period.\\nYUC has confirmed the production of granular 11-52-0 and will load its first cargo at the end of June and will have around one cargo per month thereafter if demand is there.\\nFEDERATED STATE OF ASIA\\nVietnam: Chinese cross-border tonnes dominate\\nChinese cross-border DAP is priced at around $475-480/mt CFR in bags, a level too cheap for product coming through the seaports to compete with. As such interest in bringing any vessels into Vietnam through the official import channels remains extremely limited.\\nTSP\\nEUROPE\\nBulgaria: Iran takes 75% of TSP exports\\nQ1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.\\nQ1 data, as reported by GTIS show Bulgarian TSP exports at 95,000 mt and amost exclusively shipped into Iran. This brings the total export volume to all destinations for the 12 months ending March 2015 to 250,000 mt TSP of which 187,000 mt, or 75%, were shipped to Iran.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: MoA issues new TSP tender\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture issued a new tender for 28,000 mt TSP, plus urea and MOP, closing on June 29 for delivery in bags by the end of September.\\nAgainst the MoA\\'s earlier tender that closed on June 9 for 18,000 mt TSP, an award is due to be confirmed within the next 2 days to Swiss Singapore for the full quantity. Swiss Singapore offered the lowest price in this tender at $339.33/mt CFR and $341.30/mt CFR with 180 and 270 days credit respectively.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Phosacid exports got boost in May\\nUS phosacid exports in May jumped 27.5% from one year earlier to 35,396 st (32,086 mt) P2O5, from 27,770 st (25,193 mt). However, the gain did not substantially change the trend over the first 11 months of the current fertilizer year that has closely mirrored the prior year period, according to data provided by The Fertilizer Institute.\\nThe jump in May 2015 can be accounted for by the shipment of 8,079 st (P2O5) to Brazil, compared to no exports to that country one year earlier. The lion’s share of US phosacid exports in May were accounted for in the 16,886 st loaded for India.\\nFor the first 11 months of the US fertilizer year through May, US phosacid exports were 236,180 st (214,261 mt) P2O5, compared with 248,051 st (225,030 mt) P2O5 in the previous year.\\nThe main customers for US phosacid in the current fertilizer year to the end of May were Brazil at 87,090 st P2O5 and India at 75,945 st P2O5. Canada has taken significantly less phosacid during the current fertilizer year through May compared with the prior year at 10,047 st P2O5 versus 48,605 st P2O5.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Phosacid negotiations stall\\nNegotiations started this week in Dubai between OCP and its joint venture partners for Q3 contract shipments into India. Buyers are looking for a sizeable reduction in price against the current level of $805/mt P2O5 CFR while OCP is expected to be looking for a small increase or at least a rollover. These initial discussions did not however result in any agreement.\\nBangladesh: BCIC issues tender for 50,000 mt phosacid\\nBCIC, on behalf of the DAP fertilizer Company (DAPFCL), issued a new tender for 50,000 mt solution phosphoric acid (52-54% P2O5) closing on July 29 for shipment in five lots of 10,000 mt solution to the CUFL jetty at Chittagong as follows: 1st , 2nd, 4th weeks of November, 1st and 2nd weeks of December.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nEUROPE\\nPoland: Update on Senegal rock project\\nIn the 12 months ending March 2015, Grupa Azoty imported almost 230,000 mt rock from its mining concession in Senegal, almost double the volume imported in the previous 12-month period. It plans to reach 300,000 mt in the current calendar year.\\nThe company is close to completing the feasibility study on the phosphate project. In a recent statement the chairman indicated that a decision on whether to proceed with extending the concession will be taken shortly, on completion of both the feasibility study and an environmental report. The existing mine is small with limited resources so to reach the group\\'s aim of becoming self sufficient in rock, the development of a larger mine is necessary for which the cost has been estimated at PLN 500-600 million ($135-160 million). Police\\'s annual rock requirement is currently around 1 million mt rock.\\nIt is also working with the Senegalese government with a view to supplying fertilizers into Senegal and in February shipped 10,000 mt NPKs.\\nBulgaria: Record rock imports\\nAgropolichim imported 152,400 mt phosphate rock in Q1 comprising 72,300 mt from Morocco, 55,000 mt from Syria and 25,000 mt from Jordan. While the volume from Syria was down on recent years, the quantity imported from Morocco increased.\\nRevamping work at Agroplochim\\'s Devnya plant has led to increased demand for phosphate rock. In the 12 months ending March 2015, Bulgaria imported just over 600,000 mt phosphate rock, a record 12\\nmonth volume according to GTIS data.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: RCF tender for 40,000 mt phosphate rock\\nIndia\\'s RCF issued a tender for 2 x 20,000 mt low grade phosphate rock (+/-10%), minimum 29% P2O5/63% BPL, closing on July 9 at 14:30hrs in New Delhi. Offers are to be valid for 30 days.\\nRCF requested the first 20,000 mt cargo be shipped to Mumbai in August with the second for October shipment.\\nBangladesh: Moroccan rock lowest in BCIC tender\\nAgainst its tender of June 16 for 30,000 mt phosphate rock (72% BPL minimum), BCIC received four offers. The details are as follows:\\nNP/NPKS\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices\\nThe European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.\\nEuropean NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea for 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB or the\\nequivalent when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 continues to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.\\nBelarus: NPK exports flat January-April\\nBelarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nBelarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarussian NPKs was suspended in August last year.\\nIn the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.\\nBelaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to around 240,000 mt.\\nThe company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.\\nIn 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision\\nNigeria\\'s fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack of clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.\\nThe current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).\\n\"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen,\" Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.\\nNigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops.

Suppliers had hoped that the $10/mt increase in contract prices in both China and India would help to increase waning prices, particularly in Brazil and the US, but so far this has not been the case.\\nBrazil is where most suppliers have set their sights in order to improve prices. The potash price in the country has fallen by as much as $40-50/mt in the first half of 2015 due mainly to low agricultural commodity prices, weak demand and credit issues amongst farmers.\\nNew credit is set to reach farmers in early July and demand is building towards the autumn season, causing suppliers to plan price rises step by step through the coming months.\\nBrazilian imports improved in May but remain down 25% in the year so far, according to new ANDA data. Brazil imported\\n2.8million mt potash between January and May, a near 1 million mt fall on the previous year, but May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt. Brazilian prices remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries, before moving towards $355/mt CFR in August. Achieving some kind of increase during the third quarter is likely, but Brazil is unlikely to close 2015 at the $380/mt CFR level achieved last year.\\nSoutheast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales. Similarly, some suppliers have increased prices to around $330/mt CFR for both Malaysia and Indonesia, but these levels are yet to be achieved. With currency depreciation, low palm oil prices and good stock levels in Malaysia particularly, achieving the price target will be a difficult task.\\nIn the US, action has largely grinded to a halt with the market out of season. Some potash movement remains for crops other than corn but postings have further reduced to $345-365/st FOB with distributors looking for as low as $350/st FOB. At New Orleans, barges were last seen at $320-325/mt FOB and suppliers say this level supports recent fill offers for the US interior.\\nThe European and Chinese domestic markets also remain out of season with little activity. Granular potash deals remain in the range of €300-310/mt CIF in northwest Europe but suppliers are said to be targeting price increases to around the €315/mt CIF level after discussions with buyers at this week\\'s Prague Conference. In China port wholesale prices remain in the RMB 2,000-2,120/mt FCA range with activity unlikely to build up until nearer the autumn season.\\nICL and K+S are expected to announce their contract deals to India shortly, which, if at similar levels to last year, should bring total firm volumes to around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014\\'s 4.2 million mt.\\nThe $10/mt increase in China and India, along with increased demand to both countries, must now be seen as an achievement for suppliers. It remains to be seen whether significant price increases in Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe can be achieved by the end of the year, but with price discipline less prevalent than in previous years, it is likely to be a difficult task.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙US Midwest gMOP prices fall to $345-365/st FOB\\n∙Southeast Asia sMOP prices flat, $300-345/mt CFR\\n∙US NOLA gMOP barge prices flat, $320-325/st FOB\\n∙Europe gMOP stable at €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙Suppliers target €315/mt CIF gMOP prices in Europe\\n∙Brazil gMOP stable at $330-340/mt CFR\\n∙Brazil May imports up 6.1% to 789,000 mt - ANDA\\n∙China port wholesale prices flat, RMB 2000-2120/mt FCA\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tenders for 28,700 mt of sMOP\\n∙SOP - SDIC Luobupo Jan-May production at 850,000 mt\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS NOLA: Seasonal demand done, prices flat\\nThere are few expectations for prompt demand, and suppliers note that values for granular potash already have fallen to a level that supports recent fill offers for the US interior markets. Prior barge trades were claimed at $320-325/st FOB New Orleans.\\nUS Midwest: Only marginal demand remains\\nSome potash movement to retailers remains for crops other than corn, but even most of the soybean planting has been completed at this stage. Postings generally have moved to around $365/st FOB, but more and more distributors report retailers have no need to buy prompt tons unless they are offered in line with summer fill values around $350/st FOB.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Imports improve in May but remain down 25% -\\nANDA\\nBrazil imported 2.8 million mt potash between January and May, a 25% fall (930,000 mt) year on year, according to the latest ANDA data.\\nThe majority of the reduction in imports took place between February and April, while in May potash imports increased 6.1% to 788,888 mt.\\nEarlier this month, GTIS data showed that Brazil imported 2.3 million mt between January and May, a 30% fall.\\nDuring the period, Canpotex reduced volumes to Brazil by 29% to 646,000 mt, BPC cut volumes by 43% to 434,000 mt and Uralkali curbed volumes by 40% to 398,000 mt. K+S sent 388,000 mt, ICL sent 358,000 mt (with almost half coming from its Spanish and UK operations) and SQM sent 106,000 mt, according to GTIS.\\nCurrency depreciation, weak agricultural prices and credit issues in Brazil have forced down farmer demand and caused a drop in spot prices amid strong competition in Brazil.\\nBrazil: Suppliers await demand build up\\nPrices in Brazil remain in the range of $330-$340/mt CFR with suppliers united at higher levels in the $340- $350/mt CFR range for July deliveries.\\nBPC confirmed that it has reached an agreement for a 60,000 mt delivery at $340/mt CFR in July. Currently there are limited deals as buyers react to the price increases and many made at the upper end of the range are believed to include some kind of rebate.\\nUralkali is said to be sold out for June deliveries and has set a price of $345/mt CFR for July deals. BPC, ICL and Canpotex have priced June and July deliveries at $340-345/mt CFR while SQM is expected to offer at least $340/mt CFR for July deliveries and could raise its prices to as high as $350/mt CFR.\\nBuyers have indicated some level of acceptance for higher prices but with stocks said to be pretty high and with corn prices continuing to fall below cost-of-production levels, worries remain over whether significant price increases in the $15-25/mt CFR level by the end of August can be achieved.\\nSuppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given on July 1 and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may push for an influx of buying in July and August.\\nLatin America: Uralkali agrees three shipments above $340/mt CFR\\nUralkali signed three shipments to Latin American countries outside of Brazil for June delivery at $340- 350/mt CFR levels.\\nA vessel carrying 20,000 mt granular potash is being delivered to Colombia and Guatemala, a shipment of 10,000 mt of granular potash is heading to Uruguay and a shipment of 15,000 mt of gMOP and 5,000 mt of sMOP is set for June delivery in Colombia and Ecuador.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Suppliers look for price push in Europe\\nPotash activity is seasonally slow in Europe and granular potash deals remain in the €300-310/mt CIF NW Europe range with very few deals reported.\\nSuppliers are said to have put forward to buyers possible European price increases during this week\\'s Prague Conference. ICL are said to be selling higher than €310/mt CIF while Uralkali is now looking for €315/mt CIF for granular potash from July 1.\\nIn recent weeks there has been growth regarding standard potash deals from larger buyers with news of possible tightness in the standard market, as Belaruskali produces high levels of granular product and large quantities of standard potash is sent to India and China on new contracts.\\nGenerally standard potash is said to be traded in the €275-285/mt CIF range with deals for larger buyers quoted at the €275/mt CIF level.\\nBelarus: BPC expects flat or higher potash export revenues in 2015\\nBPC expects full year 2015 export revenue to be no worse than last year and possibly better, the company\\'s Director General Elena Kudryavets told RIA Novosti on July 16.\\nThe company increased its exports of potash by 66% in 2014 to 9.5 million mt compared to 2013 as BPC recovered from the break-up of its alliance with Russian producer Uralkali in 2013.\\nThe announcement does not necessarily mean the company plans to export more in 2015 as higher levels of potash have been contracted to China and India by BPC at higher prices than last year. However, reduced spot prices in some markets such as Malaysia and Brazil may mean the company has to export more to achieve higher export revenues.\\nKudryavets said that BPC is currently supplying more than 100 countries, with the majority going to India, China, Brazil, Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the company also began exporting to the US this year for the first time since 2008.\\nShe added that BPC expects total volume of potash deliveries in 2015 to fall to 59-61 million mt this year.\\nBPC gets its potash from Belaruskali which produced a total of 10.3 million mt of potash in 2015. Belaruskali increased production in Q1 by 9% year on year to 2.6 million mt and has been producing at very high rates during Q2, pushing back planned maintenance at its RU#2 and RU#3 units until later in the year if at all in 2015.\\nWith possible higher exports from BPC and higher potash production necessary for Belaruskali\\'s increasing NPK operations, Belaruskali is likely to surpass the 10.3 million mt it produced in 2014 and may become the largest individual potash producer this year in the wake of the loss of Uralkali\\'s SK-2 mine in November 2014.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Shipments build up on contract deals\\nMore than 150,000 mt potash is scheduled to arrive in India in the next week as volumes from new contracts signed between major suppliers and buyers in India begin to filter into the market.\\nPotash arriving this week comprises seven shipments from Uralkali, APC and BPC. Uralkali sent three cargoes totalling 72,000 mt to Shriram, Zuari and IPL, APC sent two shipments totalling 30,600 mt to Zuari and BPC sent 54,000 mt to Chambal and IPL.\\nThe new volumes bring total June shipments up to 264,070 mt, according to new port data.\\nSome volumes in the RCF tender for 145,000 mt firm and 120,000 mt optional potash, which closed on May 7 and was awarded to BPC, are also likely to soon arrive in the country.\\nIn India, BPC recently agreed volumes in excess of the 700,000 mt sent in the previous fertilizer year, Canpotex closed deals for 1.3 million, APC signed 505,000 mt and Uralkali agreed deals for 800,000 mt. There are rumours that K+S signed around 150,000 mt to India, most likely with IPL, which means only ICL is yet to announce its quantities.\\nIf ICL signs volumes around the 700,000 mt it sent last year then the total volumes sent to India should be around 4.2 million mt. Factoring in optional volumes, spot deals and any further tenders through the year, Indian potash imports during the 2015 fertilizer year are likely to fall within the 4.4-4.8 million mt range compared to 2014\\'s 4.2 million mt.\\nSri Lanka: MoA announces potash tender\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture has announced a tender for 28,700 mt of standard potash, closing on 29 June.\\nIn February, the MoA\\'s last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd. with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Prices remain weak as suppliers hold offers\\nSoutheast Asian prices remain in the $300-345/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia with the low end seen in Malaysia, which remains a difficult market for potash sales.\\nLast week, two tenders totalling 15-20,000 mt were sold at the very weak $300/mt CFR level in Malaysia, likely by local traders selling off stocks, and sources say that it\\'s difficult to make any deals above $305/mt CFR currently. Some suppliers are holding prices around $330/mt CFR in Malaysia and hope that price discipline can push up the Malaysian potash price.\\nMalaysia has turned out to be a very difficult market for sellers so far in 2015. The ringgit has weakened 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months, palm oil prices remain at low levels, demand is weaker than some expectations and some sources highlight quite strong stocks. All these factors mean that competition is abundant in the country and prices have been weak so far in 2015. The Malaysian market is unlikely to build up now until August, ahead of the November season.\\nIn Indonesia, the sMOP market is believed to be trading as low as $320/mt CFR but suppliers are now said to be offering no less than $330/mt CFR, with no deals yet confirmed at that level.\\nThailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are quoted in the $330-345/mt CFR range with very few deals at the upper end and only for very small volumes.\\nChina: Potash activity remains slow with reduced imports\\nThe Chinese domestic potash market is off-season and purchasing activity is slow, with imports reduced so far in June.\\nMainstream standard potash deals have generally been concluded in the RMB 2,020-2,100 ($325-338/mt) FCA range with some small volumes still trading at RMB 2,000/mt FCA. Small quantities of the 62% K2O white MOP are still said to have been purchased at RMB 2,120/mt FCA.\\nJune imports have so far been slow, particularly for rail cross border imports which are estimated to be lower than 100,000 mt this month. May potash imports are believed to have been quite low, at roughly 550,000 mt, which would be a 41% fall on May 2014 imports and around 300,000 mt lower than in April.\\nMost sources in China expect that with the market off-season, some contracted imports are being postponed and the market should build up in the coming months ahead of the autumn season.\\nSouth Korea: Potash imports up 70% in May\\nSouth Korea imported 79,000 mt of potash in May, a 70% increase year on year and the highest May imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the month, 76% of the volumes or 60,000 mt came from Canpotex, while South Korea imported 13,000 mt from BPC and around 6,000 mt from Laos\\' producers.\\nBetween January and May, South Korea imported 312,453 mt of potash, a 5.8% increase year on year and the highest potash imports for this period since 2005. During the five-month period, South Korea imported 71% or 222,000 mt from Canpotex, 68,000 mt from BPC and 21,210 mt from Laos (surpassing volumes from Laos for the whole of 2014).\\nSOP\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Two small SOP tenders announced\\nRCF has announced a tender for 2-3,000 mt SOP closing next week on June 22 while IFFCO has announced a tender for 2,000 mt closing at the end of this week, June 19.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: SDIC Luobupo produces strongly ahead of maintenance\\nChinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo produced around 150,000 mt of SOP in May, according to sources, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt.\\nJanuary-April volumes were up 7% year on year at 696,000 mt and product seems to be continuing in this vein.\\nThe company is planning to close its operations for regular summer maintenance between the end of June and the end of August.\\nSome big buyers are believed to be purchasing SOP ahead of the maintenance dates, with prices seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT and SDIC cargoes should be sold out shortly.\\nThe price represents a RMB 350/mt fall compared to SDIC\\'s February 27 pricelist but some distributors expect the SOP price will strengthen while SDIC is down for maintenance due to the planned decline in output.\\nNPKS\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK suppliers soon to set new prices\\nThe European NPK market continues to see little activity but with demand building and significantly higher netbacks for producers sending NPKs to Asia particularly, suppliers are expected to set higher prices in Europe shortly.\\nEuropean NPK buyers are bidding around the $310-320/mt FOB level for Baltic Sea 15-15-15, but suppliers see these prices as far too low and new prices are likely to be at least $335/mt FOB when producers set their new season offers. For now, Baltic Sea 15-15-15 deals continue to be quoted in the range $320-335/mt FOB.\\nBelarus: NPK exports flat January-April\\nBelarus exported 211,000 mt NPKs between January and April, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nBelarus sent 76,000 mt to Lithuania (with much of this volume re-exported), 60,000 mt to Poland and 36,000 mt to Ukraine, where import duty for Belarusian NPKs was suspended in August last year.\\nIn the first quarter, Belarus exported 184,000 mt NPKs, a 10% increase year on year but in the month of April NPK exports fell 38% to 29,000 mt, with the majority of the exports going to Ukraine.\\nBelaruskali continues to expand its NPK production capability after launching its first NPK capacity in April, 2013. Last year the potash producer exported 181,700 mt NPKs, with 27,900 mt coming from its RU-1 facility and 153,800 mt from its RU-3 facility, which ramped up production capacity during 2014 to roughly 240,000 mt.\\nThe company is planning to ramp up NPK production to as high as 720,000 mt/year in the coming years through the introduction of new NPK lines.\\nIn 2014, Belarus exported almost 600,000 mt NPKs of which 34% went to Lithuania, 29% to Poland and 17% to Ukraine.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nNigeria: Industry suffers over lack of subsidy decision\\nNigeria\\'s fertilizer industry is currently paralysed by a lack for clarity over the future subsidy regime since President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29.\\nThe current subsidy is 50% under the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) shared between the federal and state governments, according to the Fertilizer Producers & Suppliers Association of Nigeria (Fepsan).\\n\"We have no idea of the rate and when it will happen,\" Fepsan Executive Secretary Ahmed Rabiu Kwa told Fertilizer Week. Suppliers are apprehensive and are holding off even though the farming season has begun, he said.\\nNigeria currently imports 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 from a range of suppliers for use mostly on cereal crops. The industry body estimates potential NPK demand growth at 10% per annum and assesses the average NPK import price currently at $350/mt CFR.\\nOCP recently said it is planning on sending 60,000 mt of NPKs to Africa in June, mostly 15-15-15 for Nigeria, and indicated $330/mt FOB for sales into the African markets. OCP is currently discussing July shipments for Nigeria but nothing has yet been booked.\\nFertilizer re-exports to neighbouring countries are prohibited by law.\\nNEWS\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nAllana shareholders approve ICL takeover\\nAt a meeting of shareholders this week, Allana Potash Corp has agreed to approve the company\\'s acquisition by Israeli potash producer ICL.\\nAllana Potash\\'s flagship asset is in the Danakhil evaporite basin, part of the Dallol region of the Afar province of Ethiopia.\\nUnder the agreement, most Allana shareholders will receive $0.50 in cash per Allana share while some will receive the equivalent of $0.50 in shares of ICL for each Allana share exchanged.\\nThe takeover was approved by 96% of the votes cast by securityholders and 90% of the company\\'s shareholders who were allowed to take part.\\nICL, which currently holds a 16.36% share in Allana, offered a total of around CAD 137 million ($111 million) for Allana in March, arguing that the takeover would suit its strategy to broaden its sources of raw materials globally while reducing its production costs and focusing on high growth emerging markets.\\nEarlier this year, Allana announced a preliminary economic assessment for the site which showed an after- tax net present value of $1.6 billion based on annual production of one million mt of SOP over an estimated operating life of 77 years. Allana wanted to secure financing for necessary construction by mid-2015 to begin building a mine next year. MOP production was slated begin by 2018 with SOP production the following year.\\nICL plans to accelerate pre-construction engineering work, secure project financing and reduce the company\\'s risks associated with the project.\\nThe takeover deal is expected to close on June 22, subject to certain conditions.\\nPEOPLE\\nMagIndustries reveals evidence of alleged bribery\\nPotash junior MagIndustries has announced the resignation of its auditor and has commenced a delisting review as an internal investigation finds evidence of bribes totalling several thousand dollars were paid by its subsidiaries to Congolese officials.\\nIn January, MagIndustries was prompted to carry out an internal investigation after Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched their offices. The RCMP have not laid yet any charges against MagIndustries\\nThe Toronto-based company said in a news release that there is evidence to show that its wholly-owned subsidiary Eucalyptus Fibre de Congo made four payments totalling as much as $76,500 to inspectors and officials in Congo to reduce EFC\\'s debts and taxes.\\nMagIndustries is still investigating a fifth alleged bribe, which took place in 2013.\\nHowever, due to a lack of funding from its largest shareholder, MagIndustries has had to dissolve the committee investigating the allegations, many of which involved the development of MagIndustries 90% owned Mengo potash mining project in the Republic of Congo. The Congolese government holds the other 10%.\\nMagIndustries said that its controlling shareholder, Evergreen Holding Group, has informed it that it cannot cover the millions of Canadian dollars involved as expenses to continue the investigation but will seek funds to do so.\\nIn the meantime, four directors, including three on the special committee, have resigned from MagIndustries and its chief financial officer has been suspended. In addition, Richey Morrow has been appointed its co- chief executive officer along with current CEO Longbo Chen.\\nErnst & Young has resigned as the auditor for the company effective June 16, concluding that in their professional judgment they cannot complete MagIndustries\\' consolidated financial statements for 2014 in accordance with professional standards.\\n\"Any resumption of the investigation will depend on the appointment of new independent directors and on the controlling shareholder raising sufficient funds to fund such resumption,\" MagIndustries said.\\nThe company also announced that it is reviewing the possibility of delisting from the Toronto Stock Exchange. If the company is unable to demonstrate on or before 17 July that it meets TSX\\'s requirements for continued listing, it will be forced to delist.\\nMagIndustries had been in talks earlier this year with major Chinese potash producer Qinghai Salt Lake over a possible investment by QSL in the Mengo project but with the bribery investigation ongoing, any investment is unlikely at this point.\\nThe company also confirmed in January that a Letter of Commitment from November 2013 made by the China Development Bank for the majority of funding for construction of the Mengo project remains active. The delay in approval of the loan is due to more conservative lending environment and tighter fiscal controls in China, MagIndustries remarked, but finalising the loan remains indefinitely delayed.\\nThe site\\'s potential deposit reserve is estimated at 33.2 million mt of potash, which the company intends to sell into markets in Asia, Europe and South America.\\nPROJECTS\\nSirius Minerals shares hit as planning report sees policy clash\\nNorth York Moors National Park Authority\\'s planning committee for Sirius Minerals\\' York Potash development has highlighted certain problems with the application but have yet to make a decision on whether it should go ahead.\\nThe company\\'s shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 28% on 18 June.\\nThe report says that while there is an economic case for the mine, \"the application has a clear and\\nfundamental conflict with both local and national policies… The greater public interest is considered to be that of the statutory National Park purposes which protect the North York Moors.\"\\nBuilding such a large mine in a national park clashes with current policy guidelines, the report said, and Sirius\\' consultants have underestimated the environmental effects of some details of the plan.\\nHowever, the report also said that there is \"very strong local support\" for the mine, the economic impacts could be of \"national significance\" and that mitigation plans put in place by Sirius \"go a long way towards moderating the impact\" of the mine.\\nSirius disagrees with certain policy interpretations reached by the committee and that the project is in the public interest due to \"the substantial scale of the benefits and extent to which the environmental effects have been mitigated or compensated for,\" the company said.\\n\"Responsibility for balancing the various issues related to this application rests with the members of the Authority and we believe the case for approval is very strong because the Project represents a once in a generation opportunity,\" Chief Executive Chris Fraser said.\\nThe report did not include any recommendation, leaving this up to a special planning committee on June 30. If the special committee cannot come to a decision then the application could be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which could delay the process for as long as nine months.\\nThe decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the MTS in its jurisdiction.\\nAll of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius\\' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.\\nThe company is planning a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.\\nDanakali set for Colluli Definitive Feasibility Study in Q3\\nDanakali Ltd, formerly South Boulder Mines, has submitted the last set of its social and environmental assessments for the Colluli potash project to the Eritrean Ministry of Mines and Energy.\\nThe assessments will be used to develop both social and environmental management plans, which will be submitted after the site\\'s definitive feasibility study is completed, currently estimated to be in Q3 2015.\\nIn May, the company announced a 1.1 billion mt maiden ore reserve estimate at 10% K2O equivalent at Colluli. The estimate was based on a 287 million mt proved ore reserve and an 820 million mt probable ore reserve at the Eritrean site, with over 85% of its measured and indicated resource included in the estimate.\\nThe company said the site is capable of producing SOP, SOP-M and MOP and the reserve could last more than 200 years based on modeled production rates in its recent pre-feasibility study (PFS).\\nIn March, South Boulder announced a PFS for the Colluli project. The study showed that with open pit mining the project would have initial production output of 425,000 mt/year of SOP in 2018, increasing to 850,000 mt/year from year five.\\nPotash West commissions Ercosplan\\nPotash junior Potash West has brought on German consultants and engineers Ercosplan to oversee technical operations in its South Harz project in Thuringia, Central Germany.\\nThe site requires further drilling to upgrade its resource to JORC standards and the consultants believe that a maximum of three drill holes are necessary to upgrade the project\\'s resource.\\nPotash West and Ercosplan are now planning the new drill holes and are carrying our discussions with drilling contractors.\\nThe Kullstedt part of the licence currently holds a large exploration target of 4 to 5 billion mt of potash ore at a grade of between 7 and 25% K2O.\\nEast Exploration Pty Ltd, in which Potash West has a 55% stake, owns the South Harz project.\\nIn May, Potash West said it may sell 100% of the South Harz project to Petratherm Ltd but parties decided not to proceed with the deal. Potash West and East Exploration are now looking at other opportunities to achieve a similar outcome.\\nPhosAgro launches new bulk terminal\\nRussian phosphate producer PhosAgro has now commissioned Smart Bulk Terminal, its new fertilizer terminal at Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland.\\nThe opening ceremony for the new terminal, which has a capacity of over 1.5 million mt of mineral fertilizers/year and 80,000 mt of fertilizer storage space, took place on July 16.\\nThe project is considered unique because handling and storage facilities can be doubled in a short time period and fertilizers are unloaded from railcars at the site onto specialised sea-shipping containers designed for quick loading and unloading.\\nAt present the Smart Bulk Terminal can handle 180 mineral hopper barges/day and can load ships at a rate of 15,000 mt/day.\\n\"Developing our own port terminal capacities enables us to decrease transportation costs and further strengthens PhosAgro\\'s position as the leader on the global cost curve,\" PhosAgro Chief Executive Andrey Guryev said in a company statement.\\nTotal investments in the project amounted to RUB 650 million ($12 million), with funds coming from PhosAgro and Ultramar, Russia\\'s largest provider of container transportation services for fertilizers, in accordance with their 70/30 ownership of Smart Bulk Terminal.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Brazilian prices also demonstrated increases, albeit limited.\\nTasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though this has yet to be confirmed.\\nIran’s IGCC sold 30,000 mt of crushed lump product at $139/mt FOB, according to sources, and will close a tender for 30,000 mt of granular material June 22.\\nPrices in China increased for domestic sales at port and for international business, with one trade as high as $164.50/mt CFR. Port inventories remained low, while several phosphate and NPK producers reported good stock levels.\\nFACT’s recent 15-25,000 mt tender was awarded at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyers’ prices ideas as low as $155/mt CFR.\\nAnglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded at $160/mt CFR, though some had heard\\n$155/mt CFR. At either price, the award was above Anglo’s previous tender, and still within recent weeks’\\nassessed levels of $150-160/mt CFR.\\nThe higher levels are in line with Fertilizer Week forecasts for slight increases in June and July following dramatic drops in previous weeks, as buyers held off purchasing as they awaited the bottom of the market. Market participants now report tight spot availability from Middle Eastern sellers, meaning those needing to obtain stock are having to bid slightly higher.\\nHowever, concerns persist over downstream phosphate demand, and it is not believed that fundamentals can support considerable price increases in sulphur.\\nMeanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, and is reportedly covered for requirements to late August.\\nPrices in some Mediterranean regions were pegged slightly higher, while elsewhere they were stable.\\nNegotiations for Q3 contracts across the globe are expected to have begun by next week. North African negotiations are yet to commence, with limited expectations expressed, though both sides are likely to push for price movements in the direction suited to them.\\nBrazilian buyers have indicated that they will resist any Q3 increases, and one buyer suggested they may increase their proportion of spot purchases talks result in an increase. European talks also had yet to formally commence, though no great change is expected in either direction.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Tasweeq awards tender in mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\n∙Chinese business heard up to mid-$160s/mt CFR\\n∙Iran\\'s IGCC sells crushed lump in high $130s/mt FOB\\n∙FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR\\n∙Latest Anglo tender heard at $155-160/mt CFR\\n∙OCP requirements met to late August\\n∙Q3 talks in various regions to commence over coming week\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Vancouver FOB sulphur slightly higher\\nPrices for spot exports of sulphur from Canada were assessed slightly higher, with the range extending to $130-140/mt FOB Vancouver from $130-135/mt FOB.\\nHowever, no firm deals were confirmed at the higher levels, but market participants suggested that business had already been concluded in the high $130s/mt FOB, and price increases elsewhere suggest that levels up to $140/mt FOB should be achievable.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Buyers plan to resist any Q3 increases\\nBrazilian buyers plan to resist increases on Q3 sulphur contracts, arguing that demand is unchanged while availability should be increasing in Q3.\\nBuyers expect nothing above Q2 levels of around $130-135/mt FOB US and $140/mt FOB Middle East\\nOne buyer suggested they may do an increased proportion of purchasing on a spot basis if contract negotiations prove too difficult.\\nMeanwhile, Anglo American’s latest 37,000 mt tender was reportedly awarded this week at around $160/mt CFR, though other sources pegged the number as low as $155/mt CFR.\\nThis suggests Brazilian spot levels remain in the $155-160/mt CFR range, where they have been assessed for several weeks. However, prices at the lower end of this range are unlikely to be achievable in the current market.\\nAnglo American was set to receive 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt from Corpu Christy via Koch May 26.\\nVale was set to receive several cargoes. Trammo was sending 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with and ETA of June 23, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival June 12.\\nOxbow was sending 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival June 30, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.\\nShell was sending 38,500 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival July 10, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 17.\\nAll of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Q3 talks yet to commence\\nSuppliers of Russian sulphur have not yet begun discussions for Q3 contracts with their consumers.\\nTalks are expected to commence later this week or early next week.\\nMeanwhile, suppliers say that their current loadings of product are going well.\\nEUROPE\\nMediterranean: Sulphur prices reported stable to higher\\nMediterranean sulphur prices remain mostly stable, although there were further signs of increases in some regions.\\nOne trader reported business in Egypt around $140/mt CFR, but with payment terms of six months.\\nThe same trader reported strong competition in Turkey from Greek and Romanian supply.\\nAnother trader reportedly obtained Libyan material in the low $130s/mt FOB and was expected to seek the mid-$140s/mt CFR in the Med region, but market players were not sure whether this would be achievable.\\nHowever, crushed lump product was reported sold in the high $130s/mt CFR Mediterranean.\\nEurope: Views differ on expected Q3 settlements\\nOpinions differed on the likely outcome for European Q3 sulphur contracts, although market players overall do not expect any great change.\\nNegotiations are expected to begin later this week.\\nSellers hope to recover some Q2 decreases, arguing that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as unfavourable for buyers as it as when Q2 levels were agreed. Relatively positive current global sentiment in sulphur markets will likely help them.\\nBut some buyers argue that further decreases are necessary, and point to good availability of product.\\nSettlements for Q2 ranged from a rollover to a decrease of $5/mt or less, but the assessed settlement range for barge/railcar contracts remained $158-170/mt CFR, as no settlements were reported outside of this range. However, it is likely that very few contracts were settled at the upper end of this range. The main reason for the reductions was weakness in the euro relative to the dollar, which had left European buyers paying more for their contracts in euro terms.\\nMarket participants are hopeful that talks will not drag on as long as Q2 discussions did.\\nElsewhere, Neste’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland, this week restarted production following a scheduled maintenance that began in April. It was the largest turnaround in the refinery\\'s history.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nIran: IGCC sells crushed at $139/mt FOB\\nIran’s IGCC awarded a 30,000 mt tender of crushed lump sulphur to a Chinese trader at $139/mt FOB, according to market sources.\\nThe seller will reportedly close a 30,000 mt tender for granular product on June 22.\\nQatar: Latest Tasweeq tender mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB\\nTasweeq’s latest 35,000 mt tender, which closed June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB, though no firm conclusion was confirmed.\\nTraders contacted by Fertilizer Week said they bid below $146/mt FOB but were not successful.\\nSome suggested prices may be even higher.\\nThe seller\\'s last tender closed on May 19 and was awarded in the low-to-mid-$140s/mt FOB.\\nTasweeq\\'s posted selling price for June volumes is $141/mt FOB, while recent spot sales from the Middle East have been reported in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB.\\nMorocco: Q3 talks in early stages; OCP out of spot\\nNegotiations for Q3 Moroccan sulphur contracts are still in their early stages, and parties are reluctant to disclose expected settlements at this point.\\nMeanwhile, OCP remains out of the spot market, as the buyer is reportedly fully covered till the end of August.\\nElsewhere, a vessel was sought to move 20,000 mt of granular sulphur from the Black Sea port of Poti to either Jorf Lasfar or Safi.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: FACT tender awarded at $165/mt CFR\\nFACT’s June 10 tender for 15-25,000 mt sulphur for delivery to Cochin July 6-10 was awarded to Swiss Singapore at $165/mt CFR, disproving some buyer price ideas of $155-160/mt CFR.\\nRecent business to CIL was also reported in the mid-$160s/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Prices continue gradual uptick\\nChinese prices climbed further this week, although market action was fairly limited on a lack of speculative activity. Most buying was for downstream users.\\nSpot price at ports rose to RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, up RMB 20/mt on the week.\\nPort inventories dropped to around 900,000 mt but rebounded to 930,000 mt by June 18.\\nInternational offers were in the $160s/mt CFR, being driven up by reported relatively tight availability of MIddle Eastern product.\\nSome reported bids from Chinese buyers in the low-mid-$160s/mt CFR and one trader said they had concluded a sale of 35,000 mt ex-Middle East at $164.50/mt CFR this week.\\nCrushed lump in some cases was close to $150/mt CFR, but some reported crushed lump prices still as low as $138/mt CFR.\\nAmong domestic producers, Sinopec’s Puguang was quoting RMB 1,200/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,190/mt EXW. Its inventory levels are 15,000 mt at port and 20,000 mt at plant, indicating little pressure on pricing.\\nSome large phosphate & NPK producers in Hubei said they built stock when offers were in the low $150s/mt CFR and some paid in the low $130s/mt CFR for lump product. Therefore, although port inventories declined, the stock levels in plants increased in some cases.\\nElsewhere, there was a gathering of sulphur traders in Nanjing on June 18, hosted by Bohai Commodity Exchange. The exchange, based in Tianjin in Northern China, has provided an electronic platform for spot trading of sulphur from July 2013. It is now encouraging major sulphur importers and large phosphate producers to transact on the platform.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The buyer continues to wait for the startup of a refinery that was expected to help meet its acid requirements. In addition, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender.\\nIt is yet to be revealed whether European FOB and Brazilian CFR prices have changed at all from their stable levels of recent months, and these deals should provide further indications.\\nMorocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced to as low as 30,000 mt/month and these requirements can be met by current long-term contracts.\\nIn Asia, Indian spot prices continue to be pegged in the high $60s/mt CFR as demand from the country persists. Reports of a purchase by PPL in the low $50s/mt CFR were attributed to a swap whereby the buyer will have to resell the product at the same price, suggesting that the price is not representative of true spot levels.\\nChinese import prices were also reportedly firm at $30-40/mt CFR, roughly in line with domestic prices.\\nElsewhere, South Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt. Record monthly volumes went to Thailand and Vietnam.\\n∙Petrobras seeks offers for 60,000 mt\\n∙Mosaic closes latest 12,000 mt tender\\n∙OCP reports lower spot requirement for coming months\\n∙Indian demand still firm in $60s/mt CFR\\n∙PPL reportedly gets tonnes on deal swap\\n∙South Korea\\'s May exports double on record SE Asian volumes\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals fell further over the course of the week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit weighed heavily on prices. Some metals were seen as oversold, and a weakening dollar also offered hopes for some stability. LME copper was down to $5,748/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nIn theory summer spot phosphate cargoes should be lining up for the US Gulf, but there are no substantial volumes committed outside of a part cargo expected from EuroChem this month. This leaves Mosaic with little else to do but to run its plants and fill its consignment warehouses in the US interior, keeping all of its sulphuric acid in house. Meanwhile, the working assumption is that PotashCorp\\'s closure of its sulphuric acid unit at Geismar, Louisiana, was accounted for by the market in prior months, but those expectations will be tested in coming weeks and months.\\nGlobal spot prices for sulphur continued their slow upwards March, with higher indications particularly from the Middle East and China. Tasweeq\\'s latest 35,000 mt tender was heard awarded in the mid-to-high $140s/mt FOB, and Chinese deals were reported as high as $165/mt CFR.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices remain stable for the fifth consecutive week at $1,750-1800/mt CFR China, as sulphur and ammonia prices were largely unchanged and expectations of oversupply have been tempered slightly in recent months.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras seeking 60,000 mt\\nPetrobras is seeking 60,000 mt of sulphuric acid towards its annual requirements, with bids due by June 23, sources said.\\nPetrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.\\nMeanwhile, Mosaic closed its latest 12,000 mt tender June 18, though no prices were yet disclosed. The tonnes are for August delivery.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot stable and contracts yet to finalise\\nSpot prices for sulphuric acid exports from Europe remained stable at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe, with a lack of new reported business.\\nUpcoming Brazilian sales will give a clearer indication of any possible movement from price levels that have been stable for several months.\\nMoroccan spot demand is lacking, and although overall volumes to the US are strong, spot business has been limited.\\nMeanwhile, further indications of Q3 European contracts have yet to be revealed, although no great change is expected from Q2 levels.\\nSweden: Q1 exports up 6.1% despite March drop\\nSweden exported 120,006 mt of sulphuric acid in Q1 2015, up 6.1% year on year despite a 54.5% drop in March volumes.\\nNorway, Finland, the US and Morocco remained the four largest destinations for Q1, though their relative shares altered slightly.\\nCuba took 10,500 mt after not receiving any volumes from Sweden in Q1 2014.\\nSpain: Q1 exports climb 31%\\nSpain’s sulphuric acid exports for Q1 were up 30.8% at 265,621 mt.\\nChile has been the key destination for tonnes, taking 59,020 mt compared with 38,206 mt in Q1 2014.\\nThe volumes going to Morocco increased to 49,955 mt from 12,602 mt, while tonnes to Cuba increased to 40,375 mt from 10,474 mt.\\nThe US was the destination for 19,003 mt, up from nothing in Q1 2014.\\nBrazil, on the other hand, received only 15,019 mt of Spain’s Q1 exports, down from 60,967 mt.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP requirements currently met by contracts\\nMorocco remains relatively inactive on sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.\\nThe buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is suggested that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.\\nCRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nMorocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Demand still firm; PPL gets product in swap\\nIndian demand remained firm, with prices pegged mostly in the $65-70/mt CFR range.\\nPPL reportedly obtained a cargo from Japan, with prices reported in the $50s/mt CFR, surprising many market participants. However, one source suggested the deal was a swap whereby the consumer will have to resell the same volume to the seller at the same price at a later date.\\nGood demand from the SSP sector in India is supportive of prices, especially on the west coast.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan/South Korea: Spot prices steady\\nEast Asian spot prices for export remain stable at an assessment of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, with most recent business falling within this range.\\nIndian demand remains a key supporter of spot prices, with some smaller spot enquiries from Vietnam.\\nA lack of spot availability has arisen following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi\\'s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko\\'s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc\\'s Onahama smelter.\\nThe PASAR smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for a turnaround of at least 60 days, and Korea Zinc\\'s Onsan smelter shut on May 20 for a maintenance that is likely to last 30-45 days.\\nMuch uncertainty centres on how much PASAR is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. The plant has not yet resumed output.\\nLater in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters.\\nChina: Import prices pegged $30-40/mt CFR\\nSources continued to peg spot prices for Chinese sulphuric acid imports in the $30-40/mt CFR range.\\nAcid prices in southern China were reported at RMB 360/mt for industrial use, but Jinchuan Copper’s Fancheng smelter was selling at RMB 240/mt, roughly equivalent to the $40/mt CFR import price in the region, sources said.\\nNetbacks for exports to India from southern China were pegged below $30/mt FOB, making them unattractive for domestic producers.\\nSouth Korea: May exports double; records to SE Asia\\nSouth Korea’s May exports of sulphuric acid doubled year on year to 296,090 mt, though the total for the first five months was still down 2.5% at 1.18 million mt.\\nOf the May tonnes 70,339 mt went to China, meaning it remained the largest destination for South Korean exports, though this was the smallest monthly volume South Korea has sent there since December.\\nIndia took 67,736 mt, Thailand took 46,748 mt and Chile took 46,646 mt.\\nThe Thailand volume is the largest monthly volume from South Korea to that country on record dating back to at least 1997.\\nVietnam took 19,038 mt, and this was the largest volume on record to that country too.\\nA cargo of 25,300 mt went to Mexico, and this is believed to be from the previously reported LS Nikko combi vessel tender.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The impact is likely to be felt by suppliers from most sources, but the main question faced by producers, endusers and traders is whether US prices will adjust down by a similar factor or if that market will provide a safe haven for cargoes seeking a home.\\nWhile nowhere near the $80/st collapse in US barge numbers last week, the $20-22/mt drop in Brazilian CFR numbers occured in a market that was already substantially below delivered prices into the US Gulf.\\nFreight to Brazil and the US Gulf from the Middle East do not differ substantially. The $290/mt CFR deal booked in Brazil this week would therefore reflect barge values in the US no higher than $270/st FOB. This is substantially below even the more pessimistic outlooks for July. Trades in August barge-tonnage and beyond in the US have however been concluded in the mid-$280s/st FOB, suggesting a distinct possibility of convergience for CFR values in Brazil and the US Gulf.\\nThe aforementioned $290/mt CFR price for Brazil did grab the attention of US traders. Indications for August and September barges moved down from the high to low $280s/st FOB New Orleans late this week. However, the biggest difference in coming weeks for the US Gulf should be the elimination of the large price spread as cargos now are making up for the supply shortage seen during most of June.\\nIt may of course be argued that this week\\'s sales of Middle East granular urea in Latin America do not representy the actual market and that the disposal of length was out of desperation rather than rational business decisions. Importers\\' ability to hold off on additional purchases on the back of significant existing inventory do however suggest that this week\\'s sales may be difficult if not impossible to repeat in the short term.\\nThe impact on other sources of supply will be significant if Middle East values were to stabilize in the mid $270s/mt FOB or even in the mid-$280s/mt CFR. The latter would imply offers for key destinations such as India back into the low $290s/mt CFR from the most recent sales above $315/mt CFR. This would in turn reflect Chinese netbacks no higher than $280/mt FOB and FSU Black Sea returns some $10-15/mt lower, depending on cargo-size and discharge terms.\\nChinese sellers are already fighting an uphill battle to sustain netbacks at or above $300/mt FOB, and traders appear happy to short forward positions some $15/mt lower, as was evidenced via low offers in the\\nJune 29 MoA tender in Sri Lanka that permitted shipment into September. Small sales of Chinese prills and granular in regional markets for July loading reflected similar sentiment.\\nUrea application on corn in China is about to end, and domestic demand has already tapered off from recent peaks, resulting in lower quotes, also for export. This suggests a return to export potential in excess of 1 million mt/month, a volume that will fight for outlets with product from other sources that are due to ramp up exports in coming months.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Brazilian prices nosedive to an even $290/mt CFR\\n∙Argentine importers book granular at $300/mt CFR ahead of Brazil deal\\n∙US barge-values heading closer to $300/st as short positions covered\\n∙Chinese supply limited to 425,000 mt in the STC session in India\\n∙Chinese prills continue to trade at par with regular quality granular\\n∙Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea to load by December in formula-deals\\n∙Prompt FSU prills trade in Turkey at netbacks in low $280s/mt FOB\\n∙Ukraine rejects Gazprom offer for gas at $247.18/\\'000 cbm at border\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tender June 29 oversubscribed at $10/mt discount on June 9 session\\n∙Pakistan Kharif availability finely balanced but TCP tenders yet to emerge\\n∙Sorfert in Algeria running well, but AOA output is awaiting restart\\n∙Egyptian output still erratic as government cuts gas further\\nShort term outlook\\nSofter still, and global values may still need to be corrected from some origins. Trader length rather than producer inventories triggered the most recent corrections, but continued oversupply though Q3 leaves little room for a rebound any time soon.\\nAmple pipeline stocks in most key markets outside the US imply that importers can continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations. Pockets of short positions could conceivably result in some upward voltaility, but the overall trend points south.\\nMARKETS\\nUREA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada, US Atlantic: Algerian cargo headed for 2 ports\\nA 25-30,000 mt cargo of granular urea from Algeria will load this month for Trammo, with discharges at Fairless and Contrecoeur.\\nMarket sources indicate about 10,000 mt of the urea will discharge for Yara at the Canadian port. Much of the Trammo volume could be destined for Canada also by rail from Fairless. The price tag for the imports was about $325/mt CFR.\\nUS N Plains: Dakotas not reacting with other markets\\nForward offers of granular urea are proving too much for distributors to fight when it comes to prompt pricing in the Dakotas. Postings do remain at $370/st DEL in places, but dry weather has hampered demand even before cheaper fill urea at around $345/st DEL was offered primarily from Canadian suppliers in prior weeks.\\nIt is not possible to replace granular warehouse positions at values that reflect prices in the US Gulf, Midwest or Southern Plains markets on a prompt basis. But dry weather in the region has led to disappointing sales in recent weeks, likely leaving retailers in a position to get through remaining seasonal demand.\\nUS NOLA: Broad range emerges as expected\\nBy the end of the week confirmed business for granular urea available within a prompt window were spread out between $315-352/st FOB New Orleans, with the high end reflecting business conducted just after last week\\'s close. Efforts to repeat business at the high end of the range did not succeed, but further business occured around $338/st FOB and multiple trades in the $320s/st FOB also were reported for 1H July.\\nAt the end of the week some traders were bidding around $300/st FOB for prompt barges but transactions at this price tag could only be confirmed on forward business.\\nFor months forward expectations of sharply lower prices have not come to fruition at New Orleans, as prompt demand has supported higher sales than indicated by prior forward business. Some sort of downward correction still seems very likely for 2H July-August, but August indications through FIS in the $280s/st FOB and confirmed physical trades in the $280s/st FOB for the same months would suggest that the bottom of the market is not substantially below recent market lows.\\nMarket rumours regarding the start-up of CF\\'s urea expansion at Donaldsonville, Louisiana are focused on late September or early October, at least for commercial rates. CF has not commented on this speculation.\\nUS S Plains: Truck prices come off peaks\\nEven though granular urea remains in short supply in the Southern Plains region, seasonal slow downs in demand have eliminated the peak prices seen in last week\\'s market. This week Arkansas River quotes are $390-395/st FOB.\\nTravel up the Arkansas River by barge is beginning again. Early this week travel was limited to daylight hours only and tows generally were just made up of six barges, roughly half the typical load for tugs.\\nUS Midwest: Late demand holding prices up\\nGranular urea has sold as high as $420/st FOB this week in the Midwest. Wet weather continues to force growers to choose urea for top-dress applications on corn acres rather than ammonia or UAN in some areas.\\nNevertheless, urea demand in the region likely has little time left. Corn is reported to be silking in many areas. This is not unusual for the time of year, but it means the benefits of further nitrogen applications are reduced for the current crop. Weather-related delays to top-dress applications now mean some corn acres have not received the volume of nitrogen farmers might have preferred.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: Imports down\\nJanuary-April imports by Colombia as ascertained by customs via GTIS of 109,000 mt were down by a full 35.6% on the same period in 2014. Imports from China were nevertheless up by 50% to 55,500mt.\\nDeliveries from Venezuela were off by 47% to 41,000 mt and arrivals from Russia were down by 70% to a mere 11,000 mt. There were no shipments from Trinidad and Tobago, down from 9,400 mt in the same period in 2014.\\nApril arrivals of 38,000 mt were off by 35.8%, including 20,400 mt from China, down by by 44.6% and deliveries from Venezuela were off by 70% to 6,600 mt. Russia accounted for 11,000 mt, up from zero in April 2014.\\nArgentina: Nitron widely associated with new sales\\nNitron is widely suggested as the supplier of about 30,000 mt granular urea from Oman to two buyers in Argentina. The price secured was around an even $300/mt CFR, and the trader has fixed a vessel which is due to load from Sohar in July laydays.\\nBrazil: Seller concedes $290/mt CFR deal\\nThe \"wait and see\" attitude adopted by Brazilian buyers of granular urea has paid off, yet again. Importers cited abundant availability of offers significantly below last week\\'s quotes at $308-313/mt CFR early in the week, and a part cargo of 8,000 mt was booked July 2 by a major trader with Fertipar at an even $290/mt CFR.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Activity at low ebb, but netbacks suffer\\nA 10,000 mt cargo sold by a trader for southern Turkey around an even $295/mt CFR July 2 reflected netbacks to producers at an even $280/mt FOB from Yuzhnyy, but the trader may have been disposing of a prior position at a loss.\\nOffers from producers in the low $290s/mt FOB earlier in the week were not eliciting firm counters from traders that cited netbacks marginally above $280/mt FOB in support of calls for lower prices.\\nWhile the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/\\'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/\\'000 cbm CPT. The Ukrainian government did however opt not to go for the Russian offer, citing ample opportunities to secure gas from other sources.\\nMay shipments from Yuzhnyy panned out a shade short of 100,000 mt. July nominations are so far limited to the 8,000 mt currently loading from OPZ for Koch, originally destined to Italy, but the vessel may be diverted to Turkey:\\nEUROPE\\nUK: Offers claimed abundant at low numbers\\nUK importers claim that offers for granular urea for delivery in July and beyond are still abundant well below GBP 230/mt FCA in bags.\\nA second large cargo of Algerian urea is to arrive in July off the Lucky Trader for Koch from Sorfert. Koch is also loading the SDS Wind with 7,000 mt from Sorfert, but that vessel likely heads for France.\\nA GBP 230/mt FCA suggests a delivered value around $320/mt CIF while freight from Algeria is estimated in excess of $35/mt for a regular-size carrier.\\nTurkey: Buyers aim for lower numbers\\nTrade in prilled urea in Turkey is slow, and is mainly restricted to industrial buying, including some quantities required for NPK production.\\nQuotes to importers in southern Turkey were down by more than $10/mt from last week\\'s $308/mt CFR with 180 days, duty unpaid.\\nMainstream buyers were aiming for cover around $295/mt CFR, also with credit, for prompt positions, and are holding off on forward requirements. One cargo of 10,000 mt was suggested booked July 2 at the $295/mt CFR number including 180 days.\\nFrance: Trade slows further and prices inch lower\\nRepeat sales of July positions have been concluded at €295-298/mt FCA, but buyers are aiming for €285/mt FCA for August and beyond. The €295/mt FCA reflects about $315/mt CIF, duty paid, with no provisions for margins and financing.\\nTrade in Mediterranen ports is also seasonally slow, with offers from inventory around €290/mt FCA for a $310/mt CFR equivalent, duty paid.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Safco V urea further delayed\\nAs highlighted in the July 1 news update from Fertilizer Week, the start-up of Safco V’s 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has been delayed further.\\nFollowing production trials through June, commercial output at the facility has been pushed back to some time in July, according to a press release issued by the producer.\\nMiddle East: Producers face further price-deterioration\\nNetbacks to Middle East producers on cargoes priced via formula moved down further this week while spot purchasing remained subdued.\\nFirm offers and a subsequent sale in Brazil down to an even $290/mt CFR and two deals concluded in Argentina at $300/mt CFR are indicative of returns back down in the $270s/mt FOB versus the low end of last week estimated at $290/mt FOB.\\nImporters in Thailand also maintain a \"wait and see\" attitude and are in no hurry to secure additional parcels of granular urea, and cite ample quantity in warehouses in support of calls for lower quotes.\\nProducers are generally quite comfortable into July, but traders holding contract length that are struggling to place tonnage in Latin America had no choice but to accept the low bids in Brazil and Argentina.\\nWhile also heading further south, barge values for vessels discharging in the US in the second half of July are assessed no lower than $300/st FOB this week. This suggests a delivered value close to $325/mt CFR for producer-returns marginally below $300/mt FOB. Trades in barges concluded for August delivery at $285-288/st FOB New Orleans are indicative of netbacks no higher than $285/mt FOB Middle East.\\nOne Contract of Affreightment (CoA) for four to five cargoes of 40-45,000 mt loading from Ruwais for the US has been fixed in the very low $20s/mt and a second CoA is likely to be finalised shortly at similar numbers, also from Ruwais.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: Kharif availability finely tuned\\nUrea offtake in Pakistan was 422,000 mt in May 2015, up by 3.3% on deliveries in May 2014, according to latest statistics from the National Fertilizer Development Centre (NFDC). The April-May Kharif offtake of 788,000 mt was up by 18.4% on the 666,000 mt delivered in the same period in 2014.\\nNFDC estimated urea availability in May 2015 at 745,000 mt. This included an opening inventory of 356,000 mt and local production of 389,000 mt. No imports were recorded in May. The May 2015 closing balance was assessed at 323,000 mt.\\nDomestic production for the April-September 2015 Kharif season was assessed at 2.45 million mt for a total availability including carryover and imports marginally above 3 million mt. Full Kharif offtake is projected at 2.9 million mt, indicative of an opening inventory ahead of Rabi of a mere 102,000 mt.\\nKharif imports are projected at 341,000 mt, inclusive of the 91,000 imported in April. Dreymoor and Samsung are each supplying 50,000 mt via awards in the May 29 and June 1 TCP tenders, and TCP is expected to tender shortly for the 150,000 mt cleared for import by the Economic Coordination Committee in June.\\nSri Lanka: Transmart offers lowest in both MoA tenders\\nThe June 29 MoA tender for 36,000 mt granular urea in bags and 12,000 mt prilled or granular urea in bags for September distribution in Sri Lanka attracted offers from 13 traders. Offers for granular were submitted for 420,000 mt and offers for prilled or granular totaled 180,000 mt.\\nTransmart offered the lowest price in both sessions on both a 270 and 180 day credit basis.\\nPrices ranged from $336.29/mt CFR to $359.00/mt CFR for the granular and from $335.29/mt CFR to $364/mt CFR for the prills, all inclusive of 270 days credit.\\nTransmart\\'s price for the 36,000 mt granular was $336.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days credit with Chinese product.\\nTrammo and Agri Commodities submitted the next two lowest offers at $336.75 and $337.00/mt CFRFO with 270 days respectively. Trammo offered Indonesian/Chinese product.\\nTransmart was also the lowest for the 12,000 mt prills/granular at $335.29/mt CFRFO with 270 days offering Uzbek product. The next lowest in this session was Dragon Fertilizers with Chinese at $338.13/mt CFRFO followed by AgriCommodities with Chinese at $340.50/mt CFRFO both with 270 days.\\nThe total cost package for material originating from China is assessed around $52/mt for freight, bags, bagging, financing and reloading suggesting netbacks in the mid $280s/mt FOB, some $10/mt below the lowest offers in the June 9 tender.\\nImports of urea into Sri Lanka in April identified by cutoms via GTIS in April of 61,000 mt were up by 58.6% on the prior year. Deliveries from the UAE accounted for 35,600 mt with the balance emanating from China.\\nJanuary-April imports of 138,400 mt were nevertheless down by 8.6% on the prior year, but deliveries from China were up by 353% to 103,000 mt. UAE arrivals were off by 66% to the 35,600 mt imported in April.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nNew Zealand: No new deals and May imports very low\\nThere have been no new sales of urea reported since the Trammo sale to Ballance pursuant to the June 17 negotiations. May imports identified by customs via GTIS were meanwhile limited to a mere 1,500 mt, down from 51,000 mt in May 2014.\\nJanuary-May imports of 183,000 mt were also lower, but only down by 8.6% on the prior year. Arrivals from Saudi Arabia of 123,000 mt were down by 48% while deliveries from China of 29,600 mt were up by 9%. Shipments originating in Malaysia of 26,600 mt were up by 61%.\\nThailand: Urea buyers still appear in no hurry\\nImporters in Thailand concede that there is demand for additional tonnage, but buyers continue to decline offers into the low $310s/mt CFR. Indications of possible interest in spot positions are in line with Brazilian bids well below $300/mt CFR, but sellers are holding out for better returns.\\nImports of urea in May meanwhile reached 310,000 mt, up by 25% on May 2014. Deliveries from Saudi Arabia accounted for 134,000 mt, up by 52%, and shipments from Kuwait of 61,500 mt were up from zero in May 2014. Indonesia suffered a major setback with deliveries dropping from 42,200 mt to a mere 3,600 mt.\\nThe January-May volume of 861,000 mt was down by 3.6% on the prior year but delivereis from Saudi were up by close to 1% to 385,000 mt. Arrivals from Malaysia of 125,000 mt were off by 18% and Qatar lost about 9.3% with shipments of 124,000 mt.\\nOman advanced from zero to 52,000 mt while China shipped 35,600 mt, a 38.5% drop. Indonesian arrivals of 33,300 mt were off by 50%.\\nPhilippines: Demand expected to improve\\nUrea demand in the Philippines remains low, and trading is limited to small parcels of prills changing hand ahead of the rainy season. Replacement cargoes will need to be procured once movements to farms start in earnest, and volumes are expected to improve.\\nSellers of inventory continue to hold out for prices in the $330s/mt CFR equivalent, but indications of interest from importers for forward positions are lower.\\nChina: Domestic and export values slip further\\nDomestic and export values for prilled and granular urea tapered off further this week as the end of domestic corn application nears. Asking prices remained unchanged for prills around RMB 1,700/mt ($274/mt) EXW in northern provinces, but trades were confirmed down to RMB 1,650/mt ($266/mt) EXW and at RMB 1,570/mt ($253/mt) EXW in Henan.\\nTrades in prilled and granular urea in Shanxi were completed at par with last week at RMB 1,630-1,640/mt ($263-265/mt) FCA, mainly destined for delivery to ports for export.\\nValues for prills and granular delivered into ports were largely identical around RMB 1,700/mt CPT, indicative of an export price around an even $300/mt FOB for both grades, plus a margin for an exporter.\\nRepeat export-trades in prilled and granular urea are confirmed to traders short for prompt loading for India around $302/mt FOB, and in the high $290s/mt FOB for full July loading. Traders are however evidently convinced that forward coverage will be available at significantly lower numbers.\\nSales in South Korea this week of 3,000 mt granular and 2,000 mt prills were indicative of netbacks in the low $290s/mt FOB, and the most competitive offers in the June 29 Sri Lankan tender reflected expectations of August and September availability at or below $285/mt FOB.\\nIndonesia: Kaltim books 360,000 mt granular urea\\nThe Pupuk Kaltim tender for the sale of 360,000 mt granular urea for loading through mid-December to be priced via formula resulted in awards to four traders. The session called for bids for premiums to be paid on top of prices established via a formula.\\nThe formula applies average published FOB values for granular urea in Southeast Asia and the Middle East for two weeks ahead of the date of presentation of Notice of Readiness by each carrier nominated.\\n∙Ameropa bid at a premium of $1.00/mt above the formula price and was awarded 150,000 mt\\n∙Koch bid at an initial premium of $0.80/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 90,000 mt\\n∙EuroChem bid at an initial premium of $0.40/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt\\n∙Dreymoor bid at an initial premium of $0.10/mt, subsequently raised to $1/mt, and was awarded 60,000 mt\\nKaltim retains the right not to sell/deliver under formula allocations if the formula averages plus the premium agreed result in netbacks below the producer\\'s minimum price. This will be calculated on the basis of returns achieved in the month prior to the actual month of nominations/planned shipments under the formula.\\nSwiss Singapore and CHS submitted bids in the initial round, but did not match the Ameropa proposal. The following declined:\\n∙Brio\\n∙Daewoo\\n∙Incitec Pivot\\n∙Indagro\\n∙Keytrade\\n∙Liven\\n∙Mitsui\\n∙Trammo\\n∙Yara\\nLars Taarland, Editor – Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Contributor – China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor – India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

The producer managed to sell 8,000 mt to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB in its July 2 sales tender for 15,000t for early-July loading, representing a drop of $4/mt on the producer’s previous 10,000 mt sale to Unifert. The cargo is headed for Europe.\\nAbu Qir issued another UAN-32 sales tender for 20,000 mt closing July 8, calling for bids for the tonnage for shipment July 12-15.\\nSales into France remain slow as farmers turn their attention to the impending harvest. Prices have reached €198/mt FCA in recent days.\\nGrodnoAzot sold 25,000 mt to Dreymoor, reportedly around €170/mt FOB following its June 26 tender. It is unclear where the cargo is headed.\\nAmmonium sulphate\\nActivity in the AS market has been scarce and consequently few price movements are noted. No new trade was reported fixed in China and caprolactam grade AS remain in the low $130s/mt FOB.\\nPetrokimia Gresik’s purchase of 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS last for first half August arrival to Makassar port from Fertzcomm was reportedly fixed around $148/mt CFR. This follows the buyer\\'s June 22 import tender. This would provide Chinese netbacks at least $10/mt lower than current indications.\\nA number of small Black Sea steel grade sales were concluded by Evraz and NLMK in the high $120s/mt FOB. It is unclear where these cargoes will be headed.\\nBelarus’ GrodnoAzot will close a 25,000 mt AS tender July 6.\\nIn the US the end of the spring season and subsequent fill offers from producers have resulted in much lower offers in the interior markets, albeit still above international indications. US shipments trailed demand for much of Q1 and Q2, which kept prices unusually high especially in the Midwest.\\nAmmonium nitrate/CAN\\nSummer doldrums prevail in Europe for ammonium nitrate and CAN and offshore importers of solid nitrates also hold off on purchasing. Further, but modest increases in prices for AN and CAN announced for France by Yara this week for August deliveries were in line with expectaions, but are yet to be tested in terms of quantities distributors are prepared to add.\\nBrazilian importers are declining offers for AN in the upper $220s/mt CFR, and will fight efforts by producers to maintain prices at such levels as urea prices continue to drop in the country. A sale this week of granular urea at $290/mt CFR was down by more than $17/mt on trades last week while offers for AN were unchanged or even higher than the prior week.\\nMARKETS\\nUAN\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: CF Industries’ fill offers succeeded\\nCF Industries\\' fill offers for UAN brought buyers across the region to the table to commit material generally expected to ship mostly during Q3. Suppliers are expected to seek higher prices in Q4, but for now indications across the region likely will hold at $7.56-7.81/unit FOB.\\nOverall, CF\\'s price list was more aggressive than many expected. However, it was roughly in line with indications released by small suppliers earlier in June. Aggressive pricing from all suppliers likely was needed for this year\\'s fill as anecdotal reports suggest carryover UAN is greater than nomal, especially west of the Mississippi River.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Dreymoor buys 25,000 mt GrodnoAzot material\\nGrodnoAzot sold 25,000 mt UAN-32 to Dreymoor, reportedly around €170/mt FOB following its June 26 tender. It is unclear where the cargo is headed.\\nThe producer indicated that it will issue its next tender at the end of this month.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: UAN market remains extremely slow\\nUAN sales into France have been slow as farmers turn their attention to the impending harvest. Prices have reached €198/mt FCA in recent days.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir sells to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB\\nAbu Qir sold 8,000 mt UAN-32 to Ameropa at $192/mt FOB in its July 2 sales tender for 15,000t for early- July loading. This represents a drop of $4/mt on the producer’s previous 10,000 mt sale to Unifert. The cargo is headed for Europe.\\nAbu Qir also issued another UAN-32 sales tender for 20,000 mt closing July 8, calling for bids for the tonnage for shipment July 12-15.\\nAS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Fill indications bring offers down\\nFill offers from Honeywell and other US suppliers are reported at $270-280/st FOB across the region for granular product.\\nThis is a huge drop from the sales values seen at the peak of spring demand, but the season was marked by spot outages and better than expected demand as some retailers and distributors moved away from ammonium nitrate.\\nUS S Plains: AS holds value as seasonal demand ends\\nDespite the somewhat disappointing reports regarding demand from the rice market this year due to adverse weather, seasonal demand for ammonium sulphate was sufficient to enable distributors to end June with minimal carryover.\\nQuotes for truckloads along the Arkansas River are $290-295/st FOB. This is just $5/st off the seasonal peak, when first nitrogen applications were moving to rice acres. However, prices in Texas and in parts of Oklahoma are cited $20/st or more below river terminals based on recent fill offers from producers.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot to close another AS tender\\nGrodnoAzot will close a 25,000 mt AS tender July 6.\\nBlack Sea: Steel grade sales in high $120s/mt FOB\\nA number of Black Sea steel grade sales of 1-4,000 mt each have been concluded by Evraz and NLMK in the high $120s/mt FOB. It is unclear where these cargoes will be headed, but Turkey is the most likely destination. Caprolactam grade business is non-existent.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Trade in the AS market dead slow\\nThe Chinese AS market was extremely quiet this week and prices for caprolactam grade product remain in the low $130s/mt FOB.\\nChina: Steady growth in AS exports continues\\nChinese AS exports in May 2015 at 612,498 mt grew just under 50% year-on year reflecting a similar increase from 2013 to 2014.\\nThis brings 2015 Chinese exports through May to\\n2.3million mt, up 41.8% on the same period in 2014.\\nIndonesia absorbed 462,376 mt of Chinese AS during the first five months of this year, up 76%, including both steel and caprolactam grades.\\nTurkey has also moved away from traditional Black Sea AS supply and is now importing more from China. Exports to Turkey grew 253% to 233,485 mt during January-May on greater supply options and competitive prices.\\nChinese AS shipments to Brazil have also climbed considerably, increasing 170% to 185,483 mt for the same five month period.\\nPhilippines: AS trade bogged down by import talks\\nScarce AS activity is reported in the Philippines as some government agencies are looking into regulation and storage of the product due its potentially explosive nature when mixed with nitrates. This is in response to calls from other nitrates importers who face stricter regulations than AS is subjected to.\\nWhile AS importers can currently bring in product with no issues, they face the risk of being unable to clear their shipment for discharge without the proper permits should the legislation come into force ahead of arrival of a cargo. Application for permits in advance is difficult as there are no set guidelines for the procedures suggested.\\nCaprolactam grade AS prices in the country are pegged in the low to mid $160s/mt CFR ex-China.\\nIndonesia: Gresik buys AS from Fertzcomm\\nIt has emerged that Petrokimia Gresik secured 15,000 mt caprolactam grade AS for first half August arrival to Makassar port from Fertzcomm, reportedly around $148/mt CFR. This follows the buyer\\'s June 22 import tender.\\nSouth Korea: AS shipments continue to decrease\\nSouth Korean AS exports remain in decline and stood at 35,790 mt in May 2015, down 31% year-on-year due to increased competition from Chinese product.\\nTotal South Korean shipments for January-May 2015 were 51,464 mt, less than the recorded export figure for just May in 2014.\\nExports in April were particularly poor at just 186 mt.\\nAN\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Yara posts AN and CAN higher\\nYara posted AN and CAN in France for August deliveries higher June 30. The producer lifted the quote for AN 33.5% N by €6/mt to €298/mt CPT from its June 10 quote at €292/mt CPT that was effective on posting. CAN 27% N was posted June 30 at €242/mt CPT, up from €237/mt CPT.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nLars Taarland, Writer - Global\\nTel: +47 5156 4869\\nEmail: lars.taarland@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Prices are stable albeit with a firming trend and are expected to remain so over the coming month.\\nSpots of activity were noted west of Suez where Koch is tying up negotiations for a full 40,000 mt cargo from OPZ likely to be secured within a $385-390/mt FOB range. Trammo has almost concluded a 15,000 mt purchase from NF Trading at a similar price level if not marginally below for early July lifting for Turkish receivers.\\nUp to 16,000 mt is believed sold into Turkey by Ameropa and Trammo meeting Petkim and Bagfas enquiries. While prices were not disclosed, given little price movement of late, levels are believed unchanged in the low $400s/mt CFR.\\nCuriosity over the final destination of Koch’s Clipper Neptun which is expected to pass through Gibraltar July 10 is rife. Various traders have suggested that owing to Yara’s recent 20,000 mt purchase from the Baltic, a total of 40,000 mt for July lifting is simply not available in the region. That leaves Algeria or the Black Sea as possible supply sources.\\nThe Middle East is not thought to have as much as 40,000 mt available although availability from Sabic is pegged at around 20,000 mt for August loading. A further small cargo for lifting within the next month is also not ruled out. This is linked to further delays in the commercial start-up of the Safco V granular urea plant, with the facility now expected to enter into full production late July.\\nSuch delays have given Asian buyers hope of stemming further supplier attempts to push up ammonia pricing. India’s FACT has all but refused Trammo’s offer at $490/mt CFR under its June 30 tender for 7,500 mt, while Koch’s offer to sell spot cargo off the Clipper Orion to South Korea’s Namhae and Taiwan’s CPDC at $470/mt CFR have been rejected. Negotiations continue.\\nIn the US, the $550-560/st FOB Midwest fill offers from CF Industries and similar indications from other suppliers were needed badly by retailers in the US. Many of those endusers still had ammonia purchased from January onwards at $590-620/st FOB, when the extent of the almost weekly downpours could not be predicted. The cheaper values will allow those players to substantially average their costs down going into next season, without taking away from producers\\' ability to raise price demands ahead of the fall.\\nLatest indications from Mosaic are that the company is carrying relatively little inventory of finsished phosphates, a situation that should not change in the coming months. Mosaic will ship DAP for its own system in India, and to its contract buyer in that country in the coming months. Further spot sales for India and Brazil are possible. Finally, North American producers will spend the next 60-90 days moving phosphates into position for domestic the fall season. There is little reason to expect any curtailment in ammonia demand during this period.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙NF close to securing sale to Trammo\\n∙Koch sourcing 40,000 mt from OPZ at $385-390/mt FOB\\n∙Petkim and Bagfas buy 16,000 mt total from Black Sea suppliers in low $400s/mt CFR\\n∙Ameropa sells spot cargo to Borealis off Gas Manta due to high BASF inventories\\n∙Clipper Neptun may head to Algeria or Black Sea, Baltic looking unlikely\\n∙FACT receives Trammo offer at $490/mt CFR following June 30 tender\\n∙Koch offering spot cargo to Namhae and CPDC\\nShort term outlook\\nPrices look set to remain stable at current levels with few new enquiries reported in the market.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nCurtailed production of DAP/MAP in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan will continue to constrain ammonia demand in those markets. By contrast, and in no small part helped by such production issues, Moroccan granulation levels through July and into August are looking robust.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week.\\nIn recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices have been fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.\\nMARKETS\\nAMMONIA\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Gulf: Demand may have downs and ups\\nIt is possible US Gulf demand may see some shifts downward before rebounding in August-September, depending on events outside of the supply chain to US DAP/MAP producers.\\nIn the near term, demand for spot ammonia cargos to help refill the US direct application supply chain could easily be delayed, if reports reguarding lost sales this summer prove correct. Supposedly much of the carryover ammonia remains in the hands of retailers and distributors, which helps explain the fairly aggressive fill and pre-pay prices offered for the summer.\\nLooking farther ahead, marketplace scuttlebutt indicates CF could begin commercial production from its new Donaldsonville, Louisiana urea plant in late September or early October. That plant will rely on imported ammonia through Yara until Q1 or Q2 of next year when a supporting ammonia train will be completed at the CF complex.\\nUS Midwest: CF Industries fill prices rule market\\nEven though regional buyers did not express anywhere near as much enthusiasm for fill and pre-pay ammonia, consistent reports to Fertilizer Week this week are that endusers booked as much ammonia as CF and other suppliers were willing to sell. One result is that the prompt market has moved roughly in line with fill offers from CF Industries and others at $550-560/st FOB.\\nCarryover ammonia is reported across the Midwest, due mostly to the uncooperative weather conditions. Despite this retailers generally were eager to make sure they go into the fall season with as much ammonia as they would normally carry. The $50-60/st price cut for the fill sales was more aggressive than many expected, but indicated producers\\' recognized the difficult financial math corn growers faced in the fertilizer year that just ended June 30.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Koch\\'s Clipper Orion arriving soon\\nKoch’s time-chartered carrier Clipper Orion is expected in Yuzhnny July 12 to load a 40,000 mt cargo. OPZ is reported close to concluding negotiations for the sale of the full volume to Koch with the price likely in the $385-390/mt FOB range.\\nIt has emerged that Koch’s 40,000 mt time-chartered vessel Jenny N will move to the LPG market from August, despite the trader’s charter of the vessel not expiring until February 2016. Petredec will likely use the Jenny N for LPG shipments from the US for at least six months from August.\\nThe Marycam Swan has been fixed to arrive back in Yuzhnny July 5-6 following discussions conducted between NF Trading and Trammo regarding a 15,000 mt parcel. Tthe sale is close to being confirmed with both parties pointing to Yuzhnny values in the $380-390/mt FOB range.\\nIt remains unclear whether Group DF’s Ukrainian plants CherkassyAzot and RivneAzot will restart nitrates output early July. Given announced maintenance of ammonia lines early June, ammonia would have to be supplied from an external source to run nitrates production. Group DF’s Rossosh facility in Russia had initially been suggested as a likely candidate but is still considered unlikely to agree to such a supply deal.\\nLoading of 23,500 mt OPZ tonnage on the Gaschem Stade has now been pushed back to July 8 due to delays discharging the vessel’s previous cargo in Jorf Lasfar.\\nWhile the Ukraine goverment reportedly set natural gas prices for the chemical industry for July around a $313/\\'000 cbm CPT border equivalent, and claimed that imports of gas from Russia would be suspended, the government had an offer on the table for Q3 deliveries this week from Gazprom at $247.18/\\'000 cbm CPT.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Ameropa\\'s Gas Manta diverted to Rouen\\nAmeropa reportedly sold a mid-size cargo to Borealis after the Gas Manta was diverted from Antwerp to Rouen as the vessel was unable to discharge her entire cargo due to high inventories. The vessel arrived in Rouen July 2.\\nTurkey: Petkim and Bagfas ammonia purchases\\nPetkim is linked to a 6,000 mt purchase from Trammo believed secured in the low $400s/mt CFR for first half July delivery.\\nAmeropa, meanwhile, reportedly sold just under 10,000 mt to Bagfas for mid-July arrival at a similar price level.\\nIt has emerged that Yara will lift 15,000 mt recently purchased from Gemlik at a “market price” on the Navigator Gusto around July 12 and will take the tonnage to its German Rostock plant.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nSaudi Arabia: Sabic August spot cargo may be available\\nSabic is rumoured to have at least one cargo outside of contract commitments to load in August.\\nThis follows news that Sabic\\'s partly owned Safco V 1.1 million mt/year granular urea plant in Jubail has seen its commercial start-up delayed further. It is now reported that the $530 million facility will commence commercial ouptut in July.\\nMorocco: OCP ammonia requirements low in July\\nOCP has reiterated that its ammonia requirements remain stable at a low level through July.\\nGranulation rates have been pegged at a steady 350,000 mt/month DAP/MAP with some potential to increase in July, but this necessitates additional phosphoric acid to be diverted from exports. Additional\\nammonia to run increased granulation at the JPH-1 plant is now not expected required until September at the earliest.\\nThe Gaschem Stade is expected back in Morocco mid-July to discharge a 23,000 mt OPZ cargo following delays in discharging her previous parcel due to high OCP ammonia inventories.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: FACT negotiating with Trammo after tender offer\\nFACT is negotiating with Trammo after receiving an offer from the trader at $490/mt CFR in its 7,500 mt import tender which closed June 30.\\nThe buyer indicated that Trammo\\'s offer provided discharge dates at the end of July whereas the tender stipulated delivery on or before July 15. FACT is keen to secure the cargo as early as possible while the price offer is deemed at least $40/mt above initial targets at $440-450/mt CFR.\\nFACT said its Udyogamandal ammonia facility continues to run as normal since production restarted early June but that there is tank space available for additional ammonia tonnes if purchased.\\nIFFCO said ammonia demand remains stable with little change in pricing. The buyer is taking delivery of 40,000 mt ex-TogliattiAzot off the Clipper Mars July 2 under a contract with Ameropa with the cargo priced around $430/mt CFR.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nTaiwan: CPDC seeking additional cargo for August\\nCPDC is seeking offers for an August cargo outside contract deliveries, aiming for values around $450/mt CFR. Negotiations continue with Koch and other traders.\\nConcerns over available tank space in August have been somewhat assuaged as TFC does not intend to accept contract supplier Sabic’s offer to take a 15,000 mt cargo that month in addition to cargoes in July and September. Instead TFC may choose to import 6-7,000 mt from Sabic in August and then less than 23,000 mt the following month.\\nSouth Korea: Koch busy offering ammonia cargoes\\nNamhae said it has been approached by Koch offering a 5,000 mt spot cargo for mid-August delivery, off the Clipper Orion. The trader reportedly offered around $470/mt CFR which Namhae rejected. The buyer is instead seeking values nearer $450/mt CFR.\\nSFC is in negotiations with Koch regarding the delivery of a 30,000 mt contract cargo off the same vessel.\\nIn the meantime, contract prices remain pegged around $460/mt CFR. SFC will receive 15,000 mt from Sabic off the Rosegas July 10-12.\\nNamhae will take delivery of 15,000 mt from Mitsubishi off the Viking River July 6 followed by 10,000 mt July 8-9 from Trammo off the Sanko Innovator. Marubeni will deliver 16,000 mt off the Bunga Kemboja July 13-14 and in early August 10,000 mt will be discharged again by Trammo.\\nJennifer Willis-Jones, Editor- Global\\nTel: +44 207 903 2196\\nEmail: jennifer. willis-jones@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965-7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Price for corn, wheat and soybeans all increased sharply this week in a weather dominated market, with bullishly interpreted USDA data adding further support. Indeed the crop price index is now at its highest point since mid January.\\nAt the same time concern over a potential shortage of product in the face of zero imports booked for the Fall season has supported the barge price increase. As prices move higher, imports will start to become more of a reality although as yet the differential to the global market is not quite narrow enough to prompt cargoes to be booked but it is probably just a matter of time. The widely expected Moroccan tonnes will almost surely load some time in August/early September.\\nShould Brazilian MAP demand not warrant any volume selling from Morocco through August, the US will look even more attractive to OCP. By mid September the peak Brazilian season will be over but Europe will yet be starting so outlets at that time will be sought for Moroccan tonnes. Maintaining market share in the US with new capacity coming onstream will surely be a crucial move going forward. Although OCP has been able to benefit hugely from production constraints in Tunisia, South Africa and Jordan, this trend may be short lived and OCP will need to re-establish its own key markets.\\nIn India, a two tier market is beginning to appear with a clear differential between prices offerd by traders for Chinese product and those offered by producers for a direct sale. Producers are becoming more aggressive in the all-important Indian market, looking to remove the middle man where possible and reap the benefits of direct selling. This explains the higher prices offered in recent tenders/enquiries by traders compared with the sales made by producers.\\nThe rupee has stabilised at around 63.5 against the dollar, relieving some of the pressure from importers and as such the market has stabilised in the mid-upper $470s-low $480s/mt CFR but sizeable July tonnage is yet to be priced. Importers are reluctant to price tonnes too far ahead given the tendency for rupee volatility and continued concern over potential rainfall through July and August.\\nBrazil remains the big disappointment in terms of phosphate demand this year. The lack of volume demand is putting renewed pressure on traders holding long positions, which is in turn putting renewed pressure on price levels. Current prices appear to be nearer the $490/mt CFR level although remain largely untested on limited business. However, hopes by suppliers of achieving $505/mt CFR for July have been extinguished as the market limps along, constrained by the dismal economic backdrop.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙NOLA price moves up with upper end at $430/st\\n∙Two tier market for Chinese DAP opens up in India between trader and producer prices\\n∙Brazilian market weak with MAP prices closer to $490/mt CFR\\n∙OCP secures more acid sales\\n∙GCT resumes production at La Skhira but Gabes remains down\\n∙Crop prices increase in US\\nSulphur\\n∙Adnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level, representing a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR. The price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.\\nAmmonia\\n∙Few price changes have been noted across the ammonia price index on a distinct lack of activity. Koch continues to buy up tonnage west of Suez but this is doing little to affect values\\nShort Term Outlook\\nMany in the market have already assumed that a final surge in import demand will not now be forthcoming from Brazil over the coming weeks. Whether it does or it doesn\\'t, the combination of supply constraints in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa plus good prospects for demand from both India and Pakistan and potentially the US should keep the market reasonably stable through the next couple of months. Should Brazil suddenly find some form before the end of its season, this could prompt prices to firm however this latter development is looking increasingly unlikely unless there is a sustained improvement in to the negative economic factors that weigh heavily over the market.\\nMARKETS\\nDAP/MAP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Small sales continue\\nMosaic reports sales of small lots of DAP this week into South America at $470/mt FOB Tampa for July shipment.The price tag is at the bottom of the range seen in prior weeks. Substantial movement in the Tampa benchmark in either direction seems dependent on the extent of Brazilian buying in the coming weeks.\\nUS Midwest: Demand over, fill is next concern\\nWith seasonal applications of phosphate over and done with, distributors are looking at replacement costs for summer fill. Mosaic has stuck with its earlier indication of delivered values roughy in line with spot indications to retailers of $460/st FOB.However, the barge market is gaining ground, and it is possible the producer\\'s expected target of $440/st FOB New Orleans plus freight to inland destinations might be possible despite the disappointing spring season. For this to occur the recent jump in corn values based on revisions by the US Department of Agriculture\\'s forecasts will have to hold.\\nUS NOLA: DAP barge quotes benefit from corn gains\\nIncreases in prompt and forward corn prices are getting credit for higher DAP values this week at New Orleans. July barges were no lower than $425/st FOB at the end of the week, with Mosiac material selling at $430/st FOB and a trader sale setting the low end at $420/st FOB. Forward sales are cited at $426-428/st FOB. Offers from traders are creeping over $430/st FOB for August, but buyers have not been willing to support that price tag yet.\\nThe bump in DAP values was creditied mostly to a more positive outlook for corn prices. The June 30 acreage and grain stocks reports generally were supportive of corn and even soybean values. Corn gained as much as $0.30/bushel June 30. However, by mid-day July 1, CME forward contract values through December 2015 were giving back $0.07-0.08/bushel of that gain.\\nMAP values are holding just $5-1/st above DAP at New Orleans, even though the supply picture for MAP going forward appears to be extremely tight.\\nUS: DAP/MAP inventories building at end of Q1\\nThe January-March 2015 US phosphate producer data recently provided by The Fertilizer Institute show an increase in producers\\' inventories at the end of Q1. This was likely due to weaker year-over-year demand for DAP and MAP in the US due to fewer corn acres and wet weather that affected crop choices in some areas.\\nAt the end of January - based on 100% of US capacity reporting - producers\\' DAP/MAP inventories were 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5), up 1% from the close of the previous month, and 28% above end January 2014.\\nThe February data reflected the same trend, with 571,000 st P2O5 (518,000 mt P2O5) in producers\\' inventory at month\\'s end, unchanged on January but up by 24% against February 2014. March 2015 inventories were 582,000 st P2O5 (527,987 mt P2O5), up by 2% on February and by 19% year on year.\\nInventory levels for each of the three months were above the monthly production rates of 413,000 st P2O5, 389,000 st P2O5 and 400,000 st P2O5 respectively.\\nTotal production between July-March reached 3.68 million st P2O5 (3.34 million mt P2O5), an increase of 2% compared with the previous year.\\nUS producers\\' shipments in January of this year were 407,000 st P2O5 (369,208 mt P2O5), 11% less than December 2014 and 14% below January 2014.\\nFebruary shipments were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt P2O5) 4% less than January 2015 but 7% more than the previous year. March shipments also were 390,000 st P2O5 (353,806 mt), even with February of this year but 8% less than March 2014.\\nDuring the first nine months of the current US fertilizer year, July-March, US producers\\' shipments of DAP/MAP were 3.5 million st P2O5 (3.2 million mt P2O5), down 7% from the prior year period.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nArgentina: Prices weaken to nearer $500/mt CFR\\nRecent sales have been concluded in the range of $500-505/mt CFR with current offers said to be even lower. With Brazilian demand far lower than anticipated for the time of year, long positions are beginning to build prompting competitive offers of MAP from most origins , e.g. Australian, Russian and Chinese (YUC granular 11-52-0), into alternative markets.\\nBrazil: Market stalls and prices stay weak\\nThe market in Brazil remains weak in the low $490s/mt CFR but these prices have not really been tested over the past week. Volumes are thin and demand remains limited. reports also suggest that inventories on the ground are healthy with imports arriving against previous sales and buyers reluctant to risk holding unnecessary stocks in the current economic climate.\\nThe market remains very weak as yet another week goes by with little real demand although some are hoping that the increase in soybean prices this week might prompt some renewed interest.\\nSome suppliers are still looking to achieve at or above $500/mt CFR but these levels are not workable today with demand so slow. Part cargoes from trader longs are heard sold at significantly lower levels over the past couple of weeks and although sub $490/mt CFR is not currently evident, the market would certainly appear to be nearer $490 than $500/mt CFR today.\\nReports indicate that Russian and Australian product is on offer in the low $490s/mt CFR if not lower and Ma\\'aden has a 40,000 mt cargo for H1 shipment to South America.\\nYUC is producing granular 11-52-0 in China and is indicating at or above $480/mt CFR which would equate to the low $500s/mt CFR Brazil on a direct sale basis. Eurochem too is indicating $485/mt CFR for new business but this also does not tally with recent or indeed offers being made into Brazil from current trader positions which would equate back to sub $470/mt FOB Baltic.\\nOCP has made no sales into Brazil during July and is not expected to do much if any volume business there until August if at all this season. Neither demand nor price prompts the normal volumes that OCP would expect to ship into Brazil at this time of year. In June it shipped 200,000 mt MAP/DAP preceded by 200,000 mt MAP/DAP/NPS 12-46-0+7S in May.\\nMosaic continues to ship into its own system in Brazil but has not made any new spot sales here for a number of weeks. Based on its latest spot prices at $470 FOB US Gulf range and a freight of $17/mt, it would theoretically be the only major producer in a position to offer into Brazil at a competitive level.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP benefitting from supply constraints\\nOCP has added to its July line up this week with two additional sales of phosphoric acid comprising 15,000 mt solution to South Africa and 30,000 mt solution to Turkey equating to just over 50,000 mt DAP. Although\\ngranulation has not yet started at the new JPH-1 plant, the phosphoric acid plant has been running for several weeks, some surplus acid could theoretically be made available between now and when the granulation begins towards the end of the quarter.\\nIn the meantime, OCP remains comfortable going through July, as detailed in last week\\'s Fertilizer Week report, with DAP/MAP sales to Turkey, South Africa, Algeria and Europe totalling as much as 210-230,000 mt plus a further 85,000 mt NPKs for Nigeria and other West Africa. The lack of Brazilian demand has been compensated for by the production issues in Tunisia, Jordan and South Africa which have opened up additional outlets for Moroccan DAP/MAP/TSP and acid in markets such as Turkey, South Africa, Europe, Bangladesh and of course India.\\nAs the US NOLA price moves up, the chances of Moroccan tonnes loading in August become more likely.\\nSaudi: Port data show increase in May exports\\nThe latest estimates indicate Saudi production and export rates close to capacity. Price levels in India for July are under discussion with buyers expecting a level close to $480/mt CFR or just above.\\nData for the port of Ras al Khair show exports of fertilizer in May at 264,000 mt, the largest monthly volume for the year to date. Between January-April, monthly exports were mostly in the range of 180-190,000 mt with the exception of February which had dropped to 141,000 mt. Total exports between January-May from Ras al Khair totalled 960,000 mt.\\nFor May, a total of 11 vessels were loaded and the breakdown by country included an estimated 160,000 mt for India, and 30,000 mt for Pakistan.\\nTotal production capacity at MPC\\'s Ras al Khair plant is 250,000 mt DAP/MAP per month.\\nOfficial data for June is not yet available but preliminary estimates suggest that around 220,000 mt was loaded last month, as per the table below.\\nFor July, the only Indian shipment to date confirmed is the Kribhco cargo for Ma\\'aden loading in the last week. The price is not yet agreed and is currently under discussion. Further Saudi tonnes are expected for July from both Sabic and Ma\\'aden against agreements with Zuari, Chambal and IFFCO. As such production rates and exports are expected to remain close to capacity.\\nPrice levels in India are still believed to be in the very low $480s/mt CFR for Saudi tonnes while in Pakistan recent sales have been in the mid $480s/mt CFR.\\nTunisia: La Skhira restarts but not Gabes\\nProduction has resumed at the TIFERT phosphoric acid plant at La Skhira but DAP production remains suspended at Gabes. Protestors have been blocking the railway lines into Gabes over the past month with a continual sit-in and as such the plant is unable to receive a regular supply of phosphate rock.\\nWith a return to business at La Skhira, phosphoric acid shipments to the two Indian joint venture partners, GSFC and CIL, can be resumed for Q3. Shipments to date this year for India have been extremely limited due to the renewed problems to beset the industry since December 2014.\\nMeanwhile GCT has no DAP availability for its regular Q3 customers, namely Turkey and southern Europe. OCP has already stepped in to cover part of the shortfall from Tunisia for the Turkish market, specifically to supply Gubretas with 100,000 mt in July. If GCT\\'s plant can start production over the coming weeks, Turkey and Europe, specifially southern Europe, will be the priorities.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: CIL books 50,000 mt Wengfu DAP for July\\nCIL purchased 50,000 mt DAP for July shipment direct from Wengfu, with the buyer claiming a price below $475/mt CFR. Neither of the two 50,000 mt cargoes required by CIL for August shipment has yet been booked. Trader offers meanwhile remain at higher prices, at or above $480s/mt CFR.\\nAgainst its enquiry of June 24 for 65,000 mt DAP and 35,000 mt NPK 10-26-26, Deepak received around 8 offers for the DAP mostly in the range of $480-485/mt CFR. Deepak subsequently countered at $475/mt CFR but as yet has not agreed any tonnes.\\nAgainst its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for 1H August shipment, RCF has not yet made an award but is expected to make its next move by the end of the week. As already reported, it received six offers with the lowest submitted by Wilson International, backed by Yidu Xingfa, on 35,000 mt for shipment into Gangavaram at $483.00/mt CFR. MMTC, backed by Hubei Chuxing offered the next lowest for Gangavaram or Mundra, at seller\\'s option, at $483.95 or $484.95 respectively. Rare Earth backed by YunnanHonxing, offered the lowest price for delivery to Mundra at $485.80/mt CFR.\\nThe trader offers of around $483-484.00 into India equate back to between $468-470/mt FOB China depending on freight but exclude any trader\\'s margin and provision for hedging. When taking these additional costs into account, the netback is closer to the $460/mt FOB China level.\\nRecent reported sales at the $478/mt CFR India level or lower are for panamax sales and generally concluded direct, i.e. without the need for any trader margin, thereby giving a netback in the low/mid $460s/mt FOB. These direct sales have proved more attractive not just to the suppliers but to the bigger buyers who are able to reap the benefits offered in the form of lower landed prices.\\nAny movement in the rupee will continue to have a direct impact on landed prices to India. Having crept above 64.2 against the rupee mid June, it has since settled back at around 63.6, bringing some relief to importers faced with the prospect of eroding margins once again.\\nMonsoon: Another positive factor to start the month with has been the level of June rainfall despite falling from a high of 28% above the LPA (Long Period Average), but still ending the month some 13% above. The heavy rains seen across much of the country have boosted reservoir levels that had been comparatively low from last year, in some cases to levels above the 10-year average, an extremely significant development going forward and for the Rabi season, should the monsoon fail to perform through Q3.\\nJune rains account for just 18% of the average monsoon rainfall with July and August accounting for 33% and 29% respectively and the balance falling in September. Therefore even though the heavy June rains have encouraged a robust level of Kharif planting (up by 23% yoy as of last week) and boosted water levels, it is the coming weeks that will be the most crucial.\\nIndia: RCF opens price offers\\nRCF has opened price offers against its tender of June 22 for 75,000 mt DAP for H1 August shipment in two lots, 40,000 mt to Mundra, WCI and 35,000 mt to Gangavaram, ECI.\\nPrice offers were as follows:\\nPakistan: Data show need for 650,000 mt more DAP\\nLatest NFDC data show both P2O5 and DAP consumption for May recorded at a high of 68,000 mt P2O5 and 110,000 mt product respectively. Off-take for the first two months of the Kharif season, April-May, has been extremely positive with a 20% year-on-year increase in P2O5 usage and a 17% increase in DAP. DAP sales were also 57% higher than the four-year average for this period.\\nAs such the NFDC has revised up its consumption estimate for the Kharif season to 629,000 mt, up from last month\\'s estimate of 618,000 mt.\\nThe latest NFDC report suggests a sizeable shortfall in imports for the current season but only takes into account those imports that have actually arrived into the country during April/May. The real import volume is much higher as documented over the past few weeks in Fertilizer Week and currently stands at an estimated 440,000 mt for the calendar year of which 83,000 mt is included in the opening balance and a further 65,000 mt as arrivals in April/May. Almost 300,000 mt has been booked for June/July shipment and hence added to the table below.\\nOverall consumption of DAP looking robust for the year and, barring any unforeseen negative variables, is expected to reach last year\\'s volume of 1.7 million mt which necessitated imports of around 1.1 million\\nmt. Therefore we can expect a similar volume of imports for this year, prompting a requirement for up to 600- 650,000 mt to arrive before the end of this calendar year.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: Market dominated by YUC material\\nThe DAP market has been dominated by cross border sales of YUC green product priced below the CFR equivalent of $500/mt CFR HCM in bags. As such there is no interest in product from other origins either in or outside China.\\nFarmers prefer to buy the green or natural DAP from YUC, and if this is currently in the market, there is little interest in any other type of DAP. Even if at the same price as darker coloured DAP from China, (once favoured by the market) farmers seemingly will opt for the YUC product.\\nThe netback on the YUC DAP is said to be around the low/mid-$470s/mt FOB China, but sales are concluded on a cross-border basis and as such are in extremely small lots.\\nChina: Two-tier market in China as industry gets competitive\\nWengfu\\'s sale of a July panamax, allegedly in the mid $470s/mt CFR India would netback into the low/mid $460s/mt FOB China, well within the current price range as reported in Fertilizer Week. Panamax rates to India EC are close to $10/mt but this sale is for a 2 port discharge suggesting a slightly higher rate. A two-tier market is developing in India with Chinese product as traders struggle to compete with sales being concluded direct by the producers.\\nOver the past couple of weeks, trader offers of Chinese DAP into India appear to have been consistently higher than offers and indeed sales concluded by the producers who have sold direct to the buyer. Prices in recent Indian tenders have been at or above $480/mt CFR while sales of panaxes by the larger suppliers have been concluded in the upper $470s or potentially lower in the case of CIL\\'s purchase. Traders are faced with limited margins and a more competitive stance from the industry.\\nMost recent sales to India have been concluded in the mid $460s/mt FOB China. There have been some sales of YUC DAP into Vietnam reported in the low $470s/mt FOB but these would appear to be cross\\nborder tonnes sold in very small parcels and not large enough to be reflected in Fertilizer Week\\'s price range.\\nYUC is producing gMAP 11-52-0 at its Tian\\'an Chemical plant, formerly known as Furui. It is currently producing the MAP on its two DAP trains but will switch back to DAP if demand does not support further production runs. The plant has an annual capacity for 600,000 mt DAP equating to around 50,000 mt per month. A price of $480/mt FOB or higher has been indicated for the 11-52-0 which would equate to the\\nlow $500smt CFR Brazil and higher if including trader\\'s margin. Current price ideas are in the $490s/mt CFR Brazil for 11-52-0 with limited demand.\\nPrice indications for granular 11-44-0 for late July are nearer the $365/mt FOB level and remaining weak, reflecting waning demand from Brazilian buyers all too aware of time constraints in shipping product from China after mid July.\\nThe phosphate industry will be maximising export sales, particulalry for DAP, between now and mid-August when demand from the domestic season will start to pick up to build supplies for the autumn season.\\nRain has been an issue in China in recent weeks. According to Martell Crop Projections the North-Eastern province of Heilongjiang, responsible for around 18% of China\\'s corn production, heavy rain that began in May has intensified through June, with rainfall at 150-200% of normal levels. This is said to have hampered corn planting and therefore DAP, NPK and urea consumption are all likely to be impacted.\\nPHOSPHORIC ACID\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Talks underway on NW European Q3 acid contracts\\nOCP is currently negotiating Q3 phosacid contracts with its customers in NW Europe and hopes to finalise prices by next week. It is looking for an increase on the back of its recent $5/mt P2O5 increase achieved last week in India for Q3 and Q4.\\nTo justify a further increase in Europe, OCP is citing a tight market, prompted by production constraints in Tunisia and South Africa.\\nOCP also reports two new sales of phosphoric acid with 30,000 mt solution to Turkey and 15,000 mt solution for South Africa, both for July shipment. The price was not disclosed.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: July arrivals not yet deterred by higher price\\nClose to 80,000 mt phosphoric acid solution is arriving into India during 1st week July with volumes boosted by a Senegalese cargo and another thought to originate from JIFCO/Jordan, both for IFFCO. The TIFERT\\njoint venture plant in Tunisia has resumed production after a two month stoppage and cargoes for CIL and GSFC should materialise from August if not before.\\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Rock import demand expected steady through Q3\\nRock imports continue at a steady pace supported by more attractive production costs from the imported rock/sulphur route compared with imported phosphoric acid, particularly given the recent increase, albeit nominal, in acid prices for H2.\\nEven though sulphur prices have also edged up, the price differential remains relatively wide between the two production routes and as such, demand for rock should remain healthy through Q3.\\nNP/NPKS\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: NPK imports down January-May\\nJapan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.\\nThe country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.\\nSE Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season\\nSoutheast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.\\nIn Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with prices in the other markets closer to the upper end of the SE Asian range, nearer $415/mt CFR.\\nThailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russia and 124,000 mt from Yara.\\nImports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt a year previously. During May this year, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.\\nSarah Marlow, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2277\\nEmail: sarah.marlow@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris , Writer – North America\\nTel: +1 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: Tel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor- India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey , Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

PotashCorp has yet to respond to the statement but has already informed K+S that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.\\nIn the markets, suppliers price goals for June and July deliveries to Brazil have largely failed, with very few deals signed at $340/mt CFR. Most sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR, many believe that suppliers will struggle to surpass $350/mt CFR levels by the end of Q3 unless there are significant changes to the market environment.\\nDemand has slowed across many potash markets in a seasonal lull. US NOLA barge deals cannot be seen above $320/st FOB but with BPC now considering holding off from deliveries in Q3 the market may be less oversupplied in the coming months.\\nThe Chinese domestic market is also out of season and standard prices have fallen to RMB 1,980-2,100 ($319-338)/mt FCA.\\nIn Southeast Asia foreign exchange rates continue to hold down potash prices with Malaysian potash deals still seen as low as $300-310/mt CFR. Major suppliers are staying out of the Malaysian market and focus on the other Southeast Asian markets where prices are seen in the $320-340/mt CFR range.\\nDespite weaker potash prices in Brazil, the US and the Chinese domestic market, suppliers are more confident of achieving their new price targets in the European market. As yet, the goal of €315-320/mt CIF gMOP has eluded potash producers but deals cannot be seen lower than €305/mt CIF this week in the European market.\\nIn the UK, Sirius Minerals received approvals from the North York Moors National Park Authority to mine polyhalite in the UK. The company will now look for funding towards the £1.7 billion mine and aims to have a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.\\nReaders should also note that potash indicative prices have been updated this week to take into account new prices and freight levels entering Q3 2015. For most suppliers, the $10/mt contract increases in the Chinese and Indian standard markets have been largely offset by weaker spot prices through H1.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙K+S board rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal\\n∙Sirius Minerals gets approval for £1.7 billion polyhalite mine\\n∙Brazil gMOP price down, $325-340/mt CFR v $330-340/mt CFR\\n∙US NOLA prices down, $320/st FOB v $320-325/st FOB\\n∙China domestic prices down, RMB 1,980-2,100/mt FCA v RMB 2,000-2,100/mt FCA\\n∙Europe gMOP prices up, €305-310/mt CIF v €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙Southeast Asian prices stable at $300-340/mt CFR\\n∙Europe SOP prices up, €470-520/mt FCA v €460-500/mt FCA\\n∙Sri Lankan MoA tender offers said to be around the $345/mt CFR with 180 days level\\n∙SDIC Luobupo stops SOP operations for maintenance\\n∙BPC and IPL sign MOU on potash deliveries\\n∙Uralkali Q1 revenues down 17% yr-on-yr at $720 million\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade- weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\nMARKETS\\nMOP\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Lack of interest keeps market flat\\nThe main story in the region remains the lack of interest in booking substantial fall tons compared to prior years due to carryover. Comments from distributors vary, with the divide primarily between those reporting more-than-typical volumes of granular potash and those reporting normal inventories.\\nDemand generally was better in the Midwest through the spring application season compared to other major US markets. Postings remain at $335-365/st FOB.\\nUS NOLA: BPC shipments for fall in question\\nBPC, which re-entered the US market in the just completed US fertilizer year, has said it is not committed to ship granular potash in time for the US fall season.\\nThe producer cites reports of higher inventory levels in the US supply chain at the end of the spring, and the lower prices seen in the US since the start of the spring season.\\nPreviously traders had hoped to buy 160-200,000 mt of BPC potash in time for US fall sales. Assuming no cargoes arrive in time for the annual closure of the upper Mississippi River in October, then there would be no requirement for BPC cargoes to reach the US until February in order to participate in the spring season.\\nIn the meantime, granular potash barges are cited around $320/st FOB New Orleans.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nColombia: Potash imports continue above average\\nColombia imported 153,900 mt of potash between January and April, an 8% increase year on year, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Colombia imported 72,000 mt from Canpotex, 60,000 mt from Uralkali, 15,000 mt from K+S and 7,000 mt from SQM.\\nIn April, Colombia imported 54,000 mt of potash, a 7% increase, with 35,000 mt from Uralkali and 17,000 mt from Canpotex.\\nUralkali recently confirmed around 15,000 mt of gMOP for delivery to Colombia in the $340s/mt CFR.\\nBrazil: Buyers continue to resist target prices\\nSuppliers have struggled to get their target $340-345/mt CFR prices for July deliveries to Brazil with potash deals seen as low as $325/mt CFR this week.\\nSuppliers had hoped to push up prices by $5-10/mt in each month leading into the autumn season but with high stocks, issues with farmers credit, low agricultural commodity prices and high competition, suppliers have struggled to sell product above $330/mt CFR.\\nMost sources say that supplier discipline has failed to hold and quote prices at $325-335/mt CFR. There are even unconfirmed deals signed as low as $320/mt CFR, highlighting the significant difficulties in the way of suppliers. With July shipments largely booked, suppliers are unlikely to increase their targets when it comes to August in light of the current market.\\nCanpotex and BPC recently confirmed deals for around 100-150,000 mt of potash at $340/mt CFR but most sources consider these to be outside the range for most potash deals and could include some kind of discount.\\nSuppliers hope that farmers will increase buying once new lines of credit are given in July and that worries of higher delays during autumn at the Brazilian ports may lead to increase buying in July and August.\\nHowever, many sources do not expect the new credit to filter into the hands of farmers until August at least and believe that market conditions currently make it unlikely that suppliers will achieve significant\\nprice increases as we move through Q3.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: BPC and IPL sign MoU on potash deliveries\\nBelarusian Potash Company and Indian Potash Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding regular deliveries of potash for five years starting in 2016, Belarusian state news agency BelTA said on June 29.\\n\"The document is further evidence of the close cooperation between Belarus and India. The memorandum implies regular supplies of potash from Belarus to the Indian market from 2016 to 2021,\" BPC\\'s press service told BelTA.\\nIPL is believed to have agreed deliveries of 600,000 mt potash with BPC for the current fertilizer year along with optional agreements for another 100,000 mt.\\nBPC, which generally has a smaller market share in India than Canpotex or Uralkali, said that it expects the deal will strengthen its position in the Indian market and help develop the agriculture industry there.\\nThe news comes as Indian buyer IFFCO also met BPC representatives this week regarding long-term supply deals. IFFCO Managing Director Dr Awasthi said that there had been \"fruitful discussions about long-term supply\".\\nIFFCO currently gets its potash fertilizer needs, believed to be around 500,000 mt a year, through IPL, so the long-term agreement between BPC and IPL may include some volumes destined for IFFCO.\\nIndian contract deals have already confirmed higher demand in this fertilizer year and news of future agreements may help India to combat its imbalance in nutrient application.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Suppliers more confident over price goals in Europe\\nSuppliers continue to target €315-320/mt CIF gMOP prices across Europe with little activity due to a seasonal lull in demand. Currently prices are quoted in the €305-310/mt CIF range.\\nIndications are that European buyers are less against the price increases than in Brazil and that €315/mt CIF levels may have already been achieved in some unconfirmed deals.\\nEuropean potash prices were considered comparatively weak in Q1 as euro exchange rates hit very low levels. Suppliers managed to correct the prices and a slight euro resurgence has meant that gMOP prices are seen as high as $344/mt CFR at current exchange rates.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nSri Lanka: Tender offers seen around $345/mt level\\nSri Lanka\\'s Ministry of Agriculture tender for 28,700 mt of sMOP which closed on June 29 is expected to be awarded in the next few days.\\nOffers came in from a range of suppliers including Uralkali, BPC and APC at prices believed to be above the $345/mt CFR with 180 days credit level.\\nIn February, the MoA\\'s last tender for 24,000 mt potash was awarded to Agri Resources Ltd with Uralkali tonnage after they made an offer of $345.75/mt with 180 days credit. The product was delivered in May.\\nIndia: High imports arriving on new contracts\\nIn the first 10 days of July, 150,000 mt of potash is scheduled to arrive in India as volumes from recently- signed contracts begin to filter into the country.\\nOf the volumes, 63,000 mt are going to Zuari via two BPC shipments and a 36,000 mt shipment from Canpotex. Canpotex is also sending a 31,500 mt shipment to RCF while BPC is sending one 36,750 mt shipment to IPL and one 15,000 mt shipment to TCL.\\nICL recently signed contracts to supply 835,000 mt of potash including options to customers in India between April 2015 and March 2016. The deal meant that current estimates for firm contracts have reached as high\\nas 4.5 million mt compared to 3.9 million mt in the last fertilizer year. Total imports in the 2014/15 fertilizer year reached 4.2 million mt so potash imports in the current fertilizer year are likely reach at least 4.7-4.8 million mt and may be as high as 5 million mt.\\nThe price on the new Indian contracts is $332/mt CFR with 180 days credit, a $10/mt rise on the previous year.\\nInland, dealers and retailers are said to already be full with potash stocks and any slowdown in demand may put pressure on importers for higher discounts on the Maximum Retail Price. According to one source, dealers in the northern regions are offering discounts in the range of INR 1,500-2,000/mt ($24-32) on\\nthe potash MRP with some importers currently at breakeven point for potash.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: Record potash imports continue through May\\nThailand imported 338,765 mt of potash between January and May, 21% higher than the same period in 2014 and the highest ever imports during the five-month period, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, Thailand\\'s potash imports from Canpotex were largely flat at 132,000 mt, but imports from BPD increased 20% to 93,500 mt and SQM sent 38,000 mt compared to zero in the same period 2014.\\nIn May, Thailand imported an impressive 100,000 mt with 43,000 mt from Canpotex, 27,000 mt from SQM and 18,000 mt from BPC.\\nThe country is considered highly-competitive market with prices currently quoted at $330-340/mt CFR.\\nJapan: Potash imports slow after strong Q1\\nJapan imported 230,000 mt of potash between January and May, an 11% fall on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nAfter January to April imports reached a five-year high, May imports were down 44% to 49,000 mt, including 25,000 mt from Canpotex, 8,000 mt from Uralkali and 6,500 mt from BPC.\\nThe fall meant that January to May imports were down 11%. During the period, Japan\\'s imports from Canpotex fell 20% to 164,000 mt but imports from Uralkali increased 87% to 27,500 mt and imports from BPC increased 36% to 15,000 mt.\\nCanpotex signed contract agreements to Japan for the first half of 2015 at an average price of more than $410/mt CFR but recent spot deals are believed to have been made at around $350/mt CFR. Canpotex is expected to announce prices for H2 shortly.\\nSoutheast Asia: Forex rates continue to hit potash markets\\nSoutheast Asian standard potash prices continue to be seen this week at $300-340/mt CFR with Malaysian currency depreciation continuing to hold down the low end of potash deals in the region.\\nMalaysian prices are seen around $300-310/mt CFR as slightly higher deals on a ringgit basis are offset by currency depreciation against the dollar. The Malaysian ringgit has weakened 18% against the dollar in the last 12 months.\\nHowever, the deals are said to be very small and major suppliers are staying out of the market until stocks deplete and demand increases. Most suppliers have their prices held at $320/mt CFR and higher for Malaysia.\\nWith the market generally out of season deals are hard to come by in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Prices outside Malaysia remain in the $320-340/mt CFR range across Southeast Asia.\\nChina: Domestic potash prices slip again on reduced demand\\nSlow purchasing activity and reduced demand have caused further price drops in the Chinese domestic potash market.\\nOffers remain stable with mainstream Russian red standard potash trading at RMB 2,000-2,020 ($323- 326)/mt FCA and the low-end of Russian red standard trading as low as RMB 1,980 ($319-320)/mt FCA. The high end of white 62% K2O MOP remains at RMB 2,100 ($338)/mt FCA.\\nQSL prices are seen stable at the levels indicated in its April 15 pricelist. QSL\\'s price for standard crystal MOP is RMB 2,000/mt CPT, with standard powder MOP at RMB 1,960/mt CPT\\nGranular potash deals are seen at just RMB 2,050 ($330)/mt at port, a similar level to the current weak Brazilian and US NOLA prices.\\nMay saw imports fall to 560,000 mt and June imports are also expected at a lower level. At the same time rail imports in May from Uralkali are said to be just 90,000 mt with June and July rail deliveries expected at a similar level.\\nDuring a conference call this week, Uralkali said rail to China has seen a significant decrease so far this year and previous expectations or 1.3 million mt of rail deliveries may not be reached in 2015.\\nSOP\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: SOP prices rise on tight market\\nIncreased demand and tight supply in the European SOP market has again pushed up prices.\\nSOP prices in Northwest Europe are at €470-520/mt FCA with contract deals at the low end and limited spot business by K+S and Chinese suppliers made at the top end. There are some unconfirmed deals as high as €550/mt FCA.\\nLast week, Fertilizer Week reported that Chinese SOP producers doubled their year-on-year SOP exports in May bringing year-to-date exports to 54,000 mt compared to 13,700 mt in the same period last year, including 18,000 mt to Belgium.\\nTessenderlo is still on track to increase production at the end of 2015 once it has converted its plant at Ham, Belgium, to a stand-alone SOP unit while other suppliers are likely to bring higher levels of SOP into the market by next year, easing some of the tight availability.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: SOP imports at high level so far in 2015\\nJapan imported 52,000 mt SOP between January and May, a 36% increase on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the period, Japan imported 24,000 mt from K+S, 18,000 mt from Taiwanese suppliers, 3,800 mt from Namhae and 3,700 mt from Chinese producers.\\nIn May, Japan\\'s SOP imports doubled to 12,500 mt. During the month, Japan imported 12,500 mt from K+S, 2,500 mt from Taiwanese producers, 2,100 mt from Namhae and 2,100 mt from Chinese producers.\\nChina: SDIC Luobupo stops for maintenance\\nChinese SOP producer SDIC Luobupo closed for planned summer maintenance last week and is unlikely to reopen until the end of August.\\nThe company produced around 150,000 mt SOP in May, bringing its January to May production to 850,000 mt. Chinese SOP prices were last seen around RMB 2,800 ($451)/mt CPT.\\nNPKS\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan: NPK imports down January-May\\nJapan imported 37,500 mt of NPKs between January and May, a 22% fall on the same period in 2014 and the lowest level for this period since 1997, according to GTIS.\\nDuring the period, South Korean imports from Namhae fell 42% to 19,000 mt while imports from Chinese NPK producers increased 49% to 13,500 mt.\\nThe country imported just 4,000 mt of NPKs in May, with around half coming from Namhae.\\nSoutheast Asia: NPK prices slightly lower with market out of season\\nSoutheast Asian NPK 16-16-16 prices are seen at $395-415/mt CFR this week as a seasonal lull in demand and stiff competition lowers price levels.\\nIn Thailand, prices are quoted in the $395-405/mt CFR range with other markets making up the higher end of the range.\\nThailand imported 415,928 mt NPKs between January and May, largely flat on the same period in 2014, according to GTIS data. During the period, Thailand imported 275,000 mt from Russian producers and 124,000 mt from Yara.\\nImports were very low until May, when Thailand imported 110,000 mt compared with 26,000 mt in May 2014. During May, Thailand imported around 50,000 mt each from Russian producers and from Yara.\\nNEWS\\nFINANCIALS\\nMigao Corp. see\\'s 20% increase in yearly revenues\\nChinese speciality potash fertilizer producer Migao Corp. said its revenues in the financial year ending March 31 were CAD 444.5 million ($356 million), a 20% increase year on year as higher sales and prices helped the company.\\nAs a result, Migao swung to a gross profit of CAD 47 million in the year compared with a gross loss of CAD 9.6 million in the previous year.\\nThe SOP and NOP producer said that market conditions for SOP were strong throughout 2015 compared with one year ago with higher average selling prices, but that higher sales were offset by decreases of roughly CAD 51 million in its sales of compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride.\\nThe company said that Chinese demand for NOP, compound fertilizers and ammonium chloride were weak through the year but that appreciation of the Chinese Yuan against the Canadian dollar also contributed to the dollar-based revenue increases.\\nIn the quarter ending March 31, revenues were $208.7 million, an 11% fall on the previous year due to lower average selling prices in all products except SOP, couple with lower sales volumes for all products.\\nMigao announced earlier this year that the second phase of its NPK and NOP production line with EuroChem will be launched this year. In total, the joint venture will produce as much as 60,000 mt/year NOP and as much as 200,000 mt/year NPKs in Yunnan by the end of 2015, with both parties having a 50% stake in the deal.\\nUralkali struggles in first quarter as revenues fall 17%\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali\\'s Q1 revenues fell 17% year on year to $720 million due to lower production and reduced sales volumes.\\nThe company\\'s production in Q1 fell 8% to 2.7 million mt following the loss of output from its SK-2 mine after flooding at the end of 2014. Sales volumes during the quarter were at the even-lower level of 2.5 million mt, a 17% fall year on year as subdued demand in key markets hit sales. The company attributed lower demand to currency fluctuations, lower crop prices and farmers using up existing stocks.\\nDespite this, some of the reduction in sales volumes was offset by an increased average export price of $256/mt, up 19% year on year after very low potash prices in Q1 2014 following the break-up of Uralkali\\'s alliance with Belaruskali.\\nThe company said it expected shipments to increase in H2 following a draw-down of inventories and as the autumn application seasons take place, particularly in Brazil where suppliers are targeting price increases in the next few months.\\nUralkali expects potash demand in 2015 to fall to 58-59 million mt from 63 million mt in 2014.\\nThe company said it continued to implement its plan to mitigate the damage following the flooding at SK-2. It is pumping out brine and strengthening the walls between the flooded mine and the nearby Solikamsk-1 site, but the sinkhole which opened near the mine has now tripled in area since February to 118 metres by 129 metres.\\nUralkali said that during the spring thaw, average brine inflow between March 6 and June 29 was around 300 cubic metres per hour.\\nIf there is no significant increase in flooding, Uralkali expects production to be higher than originally planned for 2015, Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Osipov said during a June 29 conference call. The company is managing some production from SK-2 in the clean-up process and Osipov said that output could reach 10.4-10.8 million mt in 2015 rather than the original estimate of 10.2 million mt, made following the initial mine incident. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.\\nThe news comes as the Russian producer announced on June 23 that it reviewed the results of a recent share-buyback programme and may de-list from the London Stock Exchange.\\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS\\nK+S rejects PotashCorp takeover proposal\\nThe board at K+S rejected its proposed takeover by PotashCorp, arguing that it does not reflect the fundamental value of K+S and was \"not in the best interest of the company\".\\nK+S confirmed that PotashCorp has offered €41 per share to acquire all of the outstanding shares in the company via a written proposal.\\n\"Not only does this proposal undervalue our potash and magnesium products and our salt business, it completely disregards the value of our Legacy Project,\" K+S chief executive Norbert Steiner said in a statement.\\nThe offer represented a 40% premium to K+S\\'s share price when it was made public on June 25 but since then shares have rallied and are currently seen at €37.\\nK+S pegged the value of Legacy at up to €21 per share and said this value is not reflected in their current share price.\\nThe German miner has already invested more than €2 billion in the project, with first production expected by the end of 2016 and positive cash flows planned from 2017 onwards.\\n\"We believe PotashCorp is trying to take advantage of the valuation gap to take over K+S and gain control over Legacy,\" Steiner added.\\nThe K+S board said the proposals are not in the best interest of the company, noting that PotashCorp has not shown it has a sustained interest in continuing the company\\'s fertilizer and salt businesses in their current form.\\n\"PotashCorp has made no firm commitments to protect the interests of the more than 14,000 employees of K+S worldwide. Despite repeated requests to address this question, PotashCorp\\'s answers have remained vague,\" Steiner added.\\nLast week, K+S said that PotashCorp informed the company that it may decide to go past the board and offer to K+S shareholders the acquisition via a public takeover offer.\\nFor more information on the proposed takeover please see Fertilizer Week\\'s recent Insight on the offer.\\nPEOPLE\\nBHP Billiton hands responsibility for Jansen potash project to Valle\\nBHP Billiton has shifted the leadership of its major Jansen potash development project in Canada to group project-management executive Dean Dalla Valle.\\nThe company named Valle as chief commercial officer and said he would oversee the Jansen development rather than petroleum president Tim Cutt. Valle takes over management of the asset from August 1.\\nShaft excavation is continuing at the 10 million mt/year project and the overall project is running within budget and roughly 40% complete. It is believed to be nearing 50% complete.\\nIn February, chief executive officer Andrew Mackenzie said that BHP is likely to make a decision within 4 or 5 years on whether to move towards production at the site and BHP continues to plan an investment of $2.6 billion in the project from 2013 through 2016, with annual spending of less than $500 million on Jansen.\\n\"Its all about timing ourselves into the market,\" Valle said in an interview with Bloomberg in Sydney on July 2. \"This has the potential to be a material business in the future, in a market that\\'s growing.\"\\nPROJECTS\\nFired Karnalyte Resources CEO takes back control\\nFormer chief executive of struggling potash junior Karnalyte Resources, Robin Phinney has reassumed control of the Canada-based company and wants to resurrect its proposed Wynard potash solution mine.\\nA majority of Karnalyte shareholders last week voted to replace the board of directors with six new directors, including Phinney.\\nThe decision marks a U-turn for the resource company after it wrote off its investment in Wynard earlier this year, arguing that the mine would not get enough financing amid lower potash prices.\\nIn May, the company stepped back from the decision, saying it was prepared to make some concessions to avoid a legal battle with Phinney and a group of shareholders but it seems shareholders were so against the decision to write-off Wynard that they reinstated Phinney.\\n\"We are well positioned to bring the Project to the next level, and most importantly, we have a Framework Agreement with KRN\\'s largest shareholder, Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd., to negotiate a major round of financing to fund the project which could be transformative for the Company,\" Phinney said in a recent statement.\\nKarnalyte continues to propose to produce 625,000mt/year of potash initially through solution mining before ramping up to 2.1 million mt/year of potash.\\nSirius gets go-ahead for York Potash project\\nNorth York Moors National Park Authority\\'s planning committee has agreed to approve Sirius Minerals\\' plan for a £1.7 billion polyhalite mine in the UK.\\nThe committee voted 8 in favour of the potash mine, with 7 against the plans, according to a spokesman from Sirius Minerals.\\nThe committee listened to arguments for and against the mine in the morning of 30 June before making its decision. The meeting comes two weeks after the North York Moors planning authority released a report highlighting certain problems with the application regarding environmental issues but not making a decision on whether it should go ahead.\\nThe decision had already been delayed until May from the start of this year and Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council has already given the go ahead for the section of the mine transportation system in its jurisdiction.\\nAll of the other major approvals have been given apart from Sirius\\' application for harbour facilities, which is currently being examined by the planning inspectorate.\\nThe company will now move forward with construction of the site, towards a 5 million mt/year operation from 2018 that may be expanded to 12 or 13 million mt/year by the early 2020s.\\nShares in Sirius are up roughly 60% since the decision.\\nTom McIvor, Editor - Global\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2142\\nEmail: tom.mcivor@crugroup.com\\nGavin Ju, Writer - Global\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: gavin.ju@crugroup.com\\nBK Morris, Writer - Global\\nTel: +001 240 965 7669\\nEmail: bk.morris@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Then Adnoc posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level. The prices are in line with the upper end of the current assessed ranges in China and India respectively.\\nEarlier this month, Aramco Trading posted its July price at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.\\nChinese prices were stable on the week, though some sources reported higher bids and offers. No trades have yet broken the $165/mt CFR barrier.\\nIndian sulphur prices were also stable on a lack of fresh activity, but price ideas diverged as some argued that weak demand should lead to lower prices despite price movements elsewhere.\\nIn other regions, spot markets were also mostly quiet.\\nSenegal is set to receive 25,000 mt from Poland, and an enquiry for 25,000 mt was heard from Vietnam as well.\\nBrazilian prices were assessed stable with no new deals reported, while new vessel arrivals were listed for late July for Anglo American and Vale.\\nIn sales tenders, both Reliance and Tasweeq issued their latest tenders, closing at July 6 and 14 respectively.\\nIn contract news, those European Q3 contracts that have settled have been unchanged from Q2, and those yet to settle are also expected to roll over.\\nDiscussions for North African sulphur contracts for Q3 are still ongoing, though negotiating parties hope they will be finalised next week or the week after.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Tasweeq posts $149/mt FOB for July, up $8/mt\\n∙Adnoc posts $150/mt FOB for July, up $5/mt\\n∙ME spot sales up to $150/mt FOB\\n∙China yet to break $165/mt CFR barrier\\n∙Indian price ideas diverge on weak demand\\n∙Senegal to receive 25,000 mt from Poland\\n∙Vietnam seeking 25,000 mt\\n∙Reliance issues latest tender\\n∙Tasweeq\\'s latest tender to close July 14\\n∙European Q3 contracts settling at rollovers\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHUR\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Spot assessed stable; more arrivals scheduled\\nBrazilian spot prices remain pegged at $155-160/mt CFR following recent business in this range.\\nBrazilian contract levels for Q3 have yet to be confirmed by negotiating parties.\\nNew sulphur cargoes on vessel arrivals lists included 35,499 mt for Anglo American at Santos’s Termag terminal on the Arietta from Qatar via Nitron and 35,000 mt for Vale at Rio Grande’s Tiplam terminal on the Sky Magnolia from Ust-Luga via Trammo. These have ETAs of July 21 and 22 respectively.\\nThere is also 42,000 mt due at Termag July 23 on the Cymbeline via Oxbow from an undisclosed seller to an undisclosed buyer.\\nAs previously reported, Vale has recently received several cargoes. Trammo sent 33,500 mt from Ust Luga on the Vipava with an ETA of June 24, having sent 33,651 mt on the Mandarin Dalian for arrival on June 12.\\nOxbow sent 31,500 mt on the Pacific Calm from Louisiana for arrival on July 2, having previously sent 38,662 mt from Beaumont on the Orange River for arrival May 23.\\nShell sent 38,000 mt on the Ocean Eternity from Beaumont for arrival June 14, while KPC was sending 31,500 mt on the RM Dynasty from Shuaiba to arrive July 24.\\nAll of the above arrivals are for Tiplam at Rio Grande.\\nAnglo American received 38,850 mt from Ust Luga via Trammo on the Kouyou at the Termag Terminal of Rio Grande June 18, having previously received 36,489 mt on the Ultra Esterhazy from Corpus Christy via Koch on May 26.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Q3 contracts settling at rollovers\\nSeveral negotiating parties have confirmed settling their Q3 sulphur contracts at a rollover from Q2.\\nOther sources said that while they have not yet settled their contracts, they are likely to settle at a rollover within the coming week.\\nSellers were hoping to reclaim some of the declines from Q2 settlements, while some buyers were hoping to achieve further decreases as they did not believe concessions for Q2 were large enough.\\nMost view the market as balanced, with firm demand and sufficient supply.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Spot up to $150/mt FOB\\nSpot availability of sulphur from the Middle East was reported as relatively tight, adding support to current minor price increases.\\nOne trader said they had already bought two 35,000 mt cargoes at $150/mt FOB, one for July shipment and the other for August shipment.\\nMeanwhile, no settlements for Q3 contracts from Middle Eastern suppliers have yet been confirmed.\\nQatar: Tasweeq\\'s latest tender due July 14\\nTasweeq’s latest tender for 35,000 mt is set to close on July 14, according to market sources.\\nThe seller’s previous sales tender for 35,000 mt, which closed on June 16, was reportedly awarded at $146- 147/mt FOB.\\nSenegal: Polish product bought in $160s/mt CFR\\nSenegal is receiving 25,000 mt of sulphur from Poland. The product was reportedly priced in the $160s/mt CFR.\\nMorocco: Q3 talks yet to conclude\\nDiscussions for North African sulphur contracts for Q3 are still under discussion, though negotiating parties hope they will be finalised next week or the week after.\\nMeanwhile, prices for Moroccan business were pegged in the $140s/mt CFR, though OCP is not currently active in the spot market as it is reportedly covered to late August.\\nUAE: Adnoc posts $150/mt FOB July sulphur OSP\\nAdnoc has posted an official selling price (OSP) of $150/mt FOB Ruwais for July, up $5/mt from its June level.\\nThis represents a delivered price to India in the low $160s/mt CFR.\\nThe price is roughly in line with market expectations, and follows recent increases in other postings.\\nIt follows Tasweeq’s announcement of its Qatar Selling Price (QSP) for July at $149/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $8/mt from its June level.\\nQatar: Tasweeq announces July sulphur QSP at $149/mt FOB\\nTasweeq announced its Qatar Sulphur Price (QSP) for July at $149/mt FOB Ras Laffan, up $8/mt from its June level.\\nEarlier this month, Aramco Trading posted its July price at $144/mt FOB Jubail, up $2/mt from its June price.\\nThe announcement follows Tasweeq\\'s most recent sales tender for 35,000 mt, which closed June 16 and was reportedly awarded at $146-147/mt FOB.\\nThe new QSP equates to delivered prices in China in the mid-$160s/mt CFR, at the upper end of the range currently deemed achievable.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Prices stable as direction debated\\nIndian sulphur prices remained assessed at $160-165/mt CFR given a lack of fresh business.\\nDemand remained weak, and some in India believe that prices there will decline as a result. But this would be directionally opposite to price movements elsewhere in the world, and seems unlikely following Adnoc’s increase of its OSP for July.\\nSome sources believe demand will pick up again in late July.\\nThere were no new vessels on the arrivals list this week.\\nIndia: Reliance issues latest 25,000 mt tender\\nReliance issued its latest tender for 25,000 mt with a laycan of July 24-28. The tender closes July 6. The seller’s last 25,000 mt tender, which closed May 25, was reportedly awarded to Sumstar at just above $142/mt FOB.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Prices stable and inventories lower\\nThere was talk of delivered prices in China reaching the high $160s/mt CFR, but no business has yet been reported above $165/mt CFR, though two traders reported deals as high as this level. Traders reported bids as high as $163-165/mt CFR.\\nIn the domestic market, granular prices at major ports were mostly around RMB 1,260-1,270/mt FCA, which is equivalent to the high $160s/mt CFR.\\nLump sulphur is traded in a RMB 1,200-1,220/mt FCA range, with supply heard slightly tight.\\nSinopec’s Puguang did not adjust its prices, leaving quotes at RMB 1,250/mt FCA at Wenzhou port and RMB 1,210/mt EXW. Railway transport has been resumed from its plant, diminishing the chance of any stock buildup.\\nPort inventory remained around 930,000 mt. Few vessel arrivals are expected in the immediate future so the stock level may fall back to 900,000 mt or even lower in the next week.\\nVietnam: Traders report 25,000 mt enquiry\\nTraders reported demand from Vietnam for 25,000 mt of sulphur, though it was not yet clear whether this was a tender or merely a spot enquiry.\\nSources in Vietnam said that recent business was heard around $163-164/mt CFR, but market participants believed that prices might now be slightly higher than this, though not much.\\nJapan: May sulphur exports down 4.6%\\nJapan’s May exports of sulphur declined 4.6% year on year to 96,040 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year down 6% at 496,766 mt.\\nThe vast majority of the May tonnes, 90,473 mt, went to China.\\nOther destinations included Indonesia (3,505 mt), South Korea (1,306 mt), and Thailand (732 mt).\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Prices to there have been unchanged for several months, with Mosaic’s recent 12,000 mt tender reportedly awarded in the mid- $80s/mt CFR. Meanwhile, Petrobras has indicated that it will decide on its 60,000 mt tender on Friday July 3, though whether it takes all, some, or none of the total volume at this stage will likely depend on offer levels.\\nMorocco is not currently active on the spot market due to its reduced acid requirement, though sellers are confident the buyer would consider buying if a deal were sufficiently attractive.\\nThe US has remained absent from the spot market.\\nEuropean Q3 contracts were reported at a rollover, in line with expectations.\\nIn the other key spot export market of East Asia, prices also seemed likely to dip pending any unexpected surprises.\\nAlthough no firm indications have yet suggested a decline in the $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, at least the upper end of this range seems unlikely to be achieved given current spot demand levels.\\nIndian buyers have reduced their prompt requirements and their prices ideas, and the upcoming FACT tender will give a better indication of current levels. One trader suggested prices to India as low as $10-16/mt FOB Japan, but other market participants were dismissive of such levels.\\nThe Chilean spot market remains quiet, and market participants are waiting to see if demand there surfaces.\\nOther potentially market-moving events in the near future will be the restart of PASAR, likely within the next couple of weeks, and Fertinal’s requirement for three cargoes for Q4. The former will likely be bearish, at least in the medium term, while the latter could be more bullish, particularly given the expectation of large turnarounds at Asian smelters in Q4.\\nMeanwhile, Japan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.\\n∙Petrobras to decide on 60,000 mt tender July 3\\n∙European contracts unchanged for Q3\\n∙Offers from NW Europe reported as low as $25/mt FOB\\n∙Lacklustre Indian demand leads to lower price ideas\\n∙PASAR yet to restart\\n∙Japanese May exports jump 51.6%\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals were again down overall week on week, as concerns over a potential Greek default on sovereign debt and a possible eurozone exit continued to weigh heavily on markets. LME copper was at $5,755/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nUnsurprisingly there is little discussion of US acid or liquid sulphur pricing ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. Serious talks are more likely to start next week regarding liquid sulphur, with some knock-on result for acid values in the US Gulf.\\nFurther signs of slightly higher sulphur spot prices emerged this week, as Tasweeq posted its July QSP at $149/mt FOB, up $8/mt, and Adnoc posted its July OSP at $150/mt FOB, up $5/mt. Spot sales from the Middle East were reported as high as $150/mt FOB, though CFR levels in China and elsewhere were mostly stable on the week.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices slipped slightly to $1,730-1,750/mt CFR China this week after being stable for six weeks following increases that began in mid-January. In recent days caprolactam June 2015 contract prices were fully settled at $1,770-1,810/mt CFR at sight in Taiwan and at $1,780-1,800/mt CFR basis 90 days in China. Sinopec concluded its June contract at RMB13,850/mt while DSM/Nanjing settled at RMB14,100/mt.\\nMARKETS\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras yet to decide on 60,000 mt tender\\nPetrobras has indicated that it will make a decision regarding its tender for 60,000 mt sulphuric acid this Friday, July 3, according to market sources.\\nSources were not certain how much, if any, of the volumes the buyer would commit to, but suggested it would be more likely to commit if the offered levels were below current spot prices in the $80s/mt CFR.\\nPetrobras needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.\\nMosaic’s recent tender for 12,000 mt sulphuric acid, which closed on June 18 and was previously heard in the high $80s/mt CFR, was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer.\\nMarket participants are expecting further Brazilian enquiries in July, but nothing firm has emerged yet.\\nPort data showed that Yara received 18,000 mt at Rio Grande via Trammo from Antwerp on the Chemroad Hope May 17.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Q3 contracts settle at rollover\\nEuropean Q3 contracts for sulphuric acid have been settled unchanged from the previous quarter, several sources confirmed.\\nOne seller said that they achieved a single small increase, but all of their other contracts were a rollover.\\nMarket participants agreed with the assessed range of €57-80/mt CFR, though the upper end of the range will represent only a small minority of settlements.\\nSources saw the market as balanced to tight.\\nEurope: FOB spot steady but indications either side\\nEuropean spot prices for export were assessed unchanged based on recent business, though there were price ideas either side of the current $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe range.\\nThe most recent reported sale was Mosaic’s 12,000 mt tender, which closed June 18 and was reportedly awarded in the mid-$80s/mt CFR to a European producer. The price is in line with Brazilian sales of the past several month.\\nOne consumer reported offers as low as $25/mt FOB from Belgium. While some said this seemed too low, others said that long loading times might push freights for Belgian sales high enough to reduce netbacks to such a level.\\nAnother trader suggested that business up to $40/mt FOB NW Europe was possible, depending on the port, but others argued that spot prices on current European sales would not reach anywhere near this high.\\nFor now the market appears roughly balanced.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP out of acid spot market\\nMorocco remains absent from sulphuric acid spot markets, as OCP’s requirements have reduced considerably and are currently met by term contracts.\\nBuyer price ideas were in the low $40s/mt CFR, and spot offers to Morocco from European sellers have reportedly declined in recent weeks.\\nThe buyer reports that its requirement has declined to around 30,000-40,000 mt/month, well below the levels that it has imported over the past year, which averaged around 80,000 mt/month. It is understood that these requirements can be met by current long term contracts.\\nCRU expects Morocco’s imports for 2015 to be below the exceptionally high 889,809 mt of 2014, which was up from 534,852 mt the previous year and 453,950 mt the year before that.\\nMorocco has sufficient sulphur-burning capacity to cover its requirements but the import of sulphuric acid offers operating flexibility.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Price ideas lower as demand weakens\\nPrice ideas for Indian sulphuric acid have weakened as a result of the current reduction in spot demand, though market participants are awaiting firmer indications from the upcoming FACT tender.\\nOne trader suggested a current spot price for India of $10-16/mt FOB Japan.\\nBut others argued that even the recent purchase by PPL in the $50s/mt CFR does not net back to a level as low as $16/mt FOB.\\nSpot price ideas were generally pegged in the $50s/mt CFR, down from recent levels in the $60s/mt CFR or even higher.\\nThis suggests that the upper end of the current assessed range of $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea may no longer be achievable for East Asian spot sellers and the assessment is likely to decline pending further information.\\nFACT’s tender for 14,000 mt for delivery at Kochi on or before August 31 closes on July 9.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nJapan/South Korea: FOB prices stable, may inch down\\nEast Asian spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $20-30/mt FOB Japan/South Korea, but are likely to decline slightly over the coming weeks given improved availability and less prompt spot demand.\\nAlthough one source suggested prices to India at $16/mt FOB Japan, others said this would not be achievable, and recent Indian prices remain pegged in the $50s/mt CFR at the lowest.\\nSpot availability following Q1 turnarounds at Mitsubishi\\'s Naoshima smelter, LS Nikko\\'s Onsan smelter and Toho Zinc\\'s Onahama smelter.\\nThen in Q2 Korea Zinc\\'s Onsan smelter shut for maintenance, as did the PASAR smelter in the Philippines.\\nA key driver of increased spot prices has been Indian prompt demand, but this appears to have diminished somewhat.\\nPASAR is still under maintenance and is likely to restart within the next two weeks. Much uncertainty centres on how much it is likely to produce over the remaining months of 2015, as the plant is expected to incorporate an expansion when it restarts. Although PASAR’s overall production for the year is not likely to be very different to its 2014 output when taking account the shutdown period, timing may mean that the market feels longer for a period in Q3.\\nLater in the year, Pan Pacific Copper is expected to conduct maintenance on its Saganoseki and Tamano smelters, which will remove large volumes from the market.\\nJapan: May exports jump 52%\\nJapan’s May exports of sulphuric acid jumped 51.6% year on year to 258,432 mt, leaving exports for the first five months of the year up 2.6% at 1.18 million mt.\\nThe Philippines remained the key destination for Japanese acid, taking 112,049 mt of the May tonnes.\\nChile was the next largest importer, taking 60,837 mt, followed by India with 46,624 mt.\\nIndonesia took 18,879 mt, Thailand took 12,020 mt, and Taiwan took 8,002 mt. The volume to Indonesia is the largest monthly volume from Japan to that country since March 2014.\\nBrendan Daly, Editor - Global\\nTel: + 44 (0) 20 7903 2185\\nEmail: brendan.daly@crugroup.com\\nIsaac Zhao, Contributor - China\\nTel: +86 10 6510 2206\\nEmail: Isaac.zhao@crugroup.com\\nDeepak Chitroda, Contributor - India\\nTel: +91 22 66875713\\nEmail: deepak.chitroda@crugroup.com\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

Producers, traders and financial institutions are all watching the session intently seeking guidance on prompt and forward values, and some possibly distinct changes in trade-flows compared to recent years.\\nAs indicated in last week\\'s issue, competiton for the open business will undoubtedly be fierce, but volumes at the prices being targeted by the Indian importer as low as the $250s/mt CFR may not be readily available.\\nMiddle East producers currently faced with netbacks around an even $240s/mt FOB in Brazilian business might opt to place significant volumes at similar returns in India, and competition from Iran is also expected for at least 350,000 mt to load by the May 27 STC deadline. Middle East participation outside supplies from Iran for significant volumes is however no certainty, but offers, direct and indirect, are expected from at least three of the producers\\nChinese producers are still maintaining offers well above the numbers perceived necessary to secure business in India, but traders may opt to short the business aggressively based on perceived prospects to secure cover permitting margins after the STC session closes.\\nFollowing declines reported last week, aggressive quotes in Brazil by traders needing to dispose of contract tonnage from the Middle East triggered confirmed sales around $260/mt CFR this week and buyers have since lowered bids into the $250s/mt CFR.\\nIn the Black Sea, the market has been relatively stable, and the combination of traders covering prior short sales and prospects of 150,000 mt to be shipped to Egypt by the end of July did stem the slide in prices - albeit to a limited degree.\\nIn the US there is a seasonal divide in granular urea barge values. A a premium of up to $25/st was paid for barges already in position along the upper Mississippi River compared to barges waiting for tows in the US Gulf. Inland prices have not benefitted from this divide. This is in part due to the premium already available over barge costs in the truck markets. However, aggressive summer fill offers already are available, at the equivalent to $30-35/st discounts to current inland truck pricing. These tons would be delivered during Q3. This will not only make achieving higher truck values nearly impossible, but also prompt some sellers to price aggressively during Q2 to liquidate old positions.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙Offers to STC in April 10 tender to provide some clarity on regional urea values\\n∙Egyptian April 18 tender for 150,000 mt conatins complex payment structure\\n∙Pakistan urea tender not yet in sight after ECC April 1 meeting\\n∙Brazilian granular values drop to an even $260/mt CFR\\n∙Middle East returns slide accordingly\\n∙Netbacks on European granular sales dip below $280s/mt FOB from Egypt\\n∙Offers for forward European granular positions down sharply\\n∙Qafco III, V and VI restart\\n∙Safco V commercial urea output maintained for mid-May\\n∙Black Sea prills sold by producers to traders around an even $260/mt FOB\\nShort term outlook\\nSoft, but a floor may still be in sight in the short term despite the continuing deterioration in netbacks for granular from the Middle East. Market direction will largely depend on the outcome of the April 10 STC tender, but prospects are for some further declines rather than a major price-recovery are minor.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: Wet weather still a drag on market\\nGranular urea is selling as low as $320/st FOB along the Arkansas River, although pricing is about $10/st higher in some areas. Sales have been slowed again by wet weather, and by concerns that demand for urea will disappoint if soybean planting in the region exceeds forecasts.\\nSummer fill\\nWhile distributors wait for better weather for spring business, they have turned to offers for summer fill urea. Suppliers are quoting tons that would be delivered during Q3 at $280-285/st FOB. Even though this material will not be available in time for the current season, the $40/st cheaper price tag compared to prompt sales likely will discourage retailers from risking any carryover tons.\\nUS Midwest: Urea pricing finds support after declines\\nGranular urea pricing is as low as $320-325/st FOB this week from the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and similar values are suggested from terminals along the upper river system in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. Postings are $5-10/st higher from inland warehouses that depend on rail for resupply.\\nDemand is steady, and distributors believe sales should accelerate not only as the ground dries out over the coming weekend, but also as the side-dress season for corn approaches in May and June.\\nForward\\nSummer fill offers are available already, even though most of the spring season remains in the region. Truck values from the Twin Cities for delivery in Q3 are $285-290/st FOB.\\nUS New Orleans: Seasonal divide in barge urea values\\nGranular urea barges available on a prompt basis at New Orleans traded as low as $265/st FOB New Orleans this week for barges in the Gulf, while granular urea barges available on up-river tows sold up to $290/st FOB.\\nOverall most trades occured in the low $270s/st FOB, with Chinese and non-Chinese material trading at roughly the same values. The highest price tags were for barges tied up at Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri, which sold as high as $285/st FOB and $290/st FOB respectively basis New Orleans.\\nSummer fill\\nEven though the spring season is far from over for US urea consumption, importers and at least one North American producer are offering granular urea for Q3 delivery. Pricing is on a FOB truck basis from inland terminals and by barge, typically priced on a delivered basis. The indicated values in all cases generally equate to $252-254/st FOB New Orleans, allowing for a modest margin to a trader.\\nUS: Urea poured in during February\\nUS granular urea arrivals surged by more more than 200,000 mt during February compared to one year earlier, pushing July-February arrival totals more than 1.1 million mt over arrivals during the first eight months of the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.\\nFebruary 2015 imports were 868,377 st (787,786 mt), up substantially from 611,160 st (554,441 mt) one year ealier. Traditional suppliers made up most of the arrivals during the most recent month, with almost all of the those countries adding to their February 2014 volume. The largest suppliers to the US in February 2015 all were in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia at 147,576 st, Qatar at 110,060 st and the UAE at 109,953 st. An exception to the trend was Canada, whose February arrivals in the US fell to 58,057 st from 96,566 st--most likely due to domestic demand in Canada.\\nThe February imports brought the first eight months of the US fertilizer year to 5.51 million st (5 million mt), up a whopping 1.26 million st from 4.25 million st (3.86 million mt) during the prior year period.\\nMajor suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Qatar at 1.09 million st, China at 971,778 st (most of which discharged in July-December) and Canada at 600,103 st.\\nExports\\nUS urea exports in February of this year were 11,860 st , (10,759 mt) down from 16,576 st (15,038 mt) one year earlier. In both months most of the tons shipped in very small lots to about a dozen countries. During July-February of the current fertilizer year 149,455 st (135,585 mt) was shipped internationally versus 193,439 st (175,487 mt) during the prior year period. Canada remained the primary destination for US urea, with 120,862 st) loaded for that country.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nCentral America: Incofe testing urea and AN values April 10\\nAs was indicated in prior issues, Incofe opted to tender April 10 for 20,000 mt prilled FSU urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN and an optional 5,000 mt granular urea for first half May shipment. The prilled urea is to be delivered to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala (5,000 mt). The optional 5,000 mt granular urea is destined for Limon/Costa Rica.\\nThe 10,000 mt AN is to be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt).\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: Limited activity as buyers hold off\\nProducers and marketers are still attempting to hold netbacks on prilled sales in the $250s/mt FOB, but buying interest at that level is limited, to put it mildly. Unlike marketers shipping from the Black Sea, Baltic suppliers will not benefit from the same proximity to Egypt in the April 18 General Agricultural Cooperative Association tender in Egypt, and will also not be able to consider India a viable outlet due to freight disadvantages.\\nReports early in the week of a sale to Agrogen in Mexico at a netback marginally below $247/mt FOB are since termed incorrect as the buyer did not lift the subjects in the deal.\\nThe range for the week is nevertheless set at $247-252/mt FOB to reflect actual deals concluded and a firm offer to cover a cargo at the low end of the range.\\nBlack Sea: Repeat sale of prilled urea suggested close to $260/mt FOB\\nDespite numerous claims by traders of availability of Black Sea prills from the Black Sea down to $250/mt FOB, DnieproAzot claims a netback around $260/mt FOB Yuzhnyy in a sale this week to a trader short on a prior deal.\\nOffers are maintained at $260/mt FOB by producers and marketers, but bids are generally some $5/mt lower, and interest is limited as traders try to evaluate impacts of the upcoming April 10 and April 18 tenders in India and Egypt.\\nLow offers in the April 10 STC session will likely reflect netbacks to the Black Sea in low the $240s/mt FOB, at best, an unattractive proposition to FSU suppliers, but price-corrections to compete cannot be completely excluded.\\nThe April 18 General Agricultural Cooperative Association tender is expected to provide some support for Black Sea prices, but the extended delivery period of three months and cumbersome/extended payment terms may limit producer/trader interest in the session.\\nShipments and fully firm nominations for cargos to load from Yuzhnyy are meanwhile at 44,201 mt. Keytrade is expected to nominate a carrier to load 25,000 mt DnieproAzot terminal towards the end of the month.\\n\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 14\\n(1)cargo from TIS - DneproAzot\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Prices for granular urea flat for spot but forward drops sharply\\nRecent declines in granular urea values have yet to trigger significant spot purchasing activity in the French Bay. Offers for prompt positions remain around €310-315/mt FCA, but activity is subdued.\\nThe low end implies delivered values at $322/mt CFR basis the euro at $1.075, and reflects around $290/mt FOB Egypt with limited provisions for costs and a margin. Offers for summer-fill and forward positions\\nare suggested below €290/mt FCA.\\nIn the French Mediterranean, buyers are still citing offers at or marginally below a $305/mt CFR equivalent for prompt positions, in line with recent sales into Spain.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Pressure builds further, but Indian prospects are good\\nMiddle East producers of granular urea are faced with continuing pressure on prices in all key markets. No new spot deals are reported but firm offers are suggested available around an even $250/mt FOB. Firm offers in Brazil off inbound carriers have dipped to $260/mt CFR. The drop by about $7/mt on last week imply netbacks to sellers no better than $240/mt FOB Middle East and offers below $260/mt CFR in Brazil are suggested available for additional parcels off inbound carriers.\\nForward US prices for cargos yet to load are assessed around an even $260/st FOB barge at New Orleans, suggesting netbacks to Middle East producers around $255/mt FOB after deduction of freight, costs and a margin to an intermediary.\\nOffers in Thailand down to $270/mt CFR did not elicit firm buying interest last week, and buyers appear content to await the outcome in the April 10 STC tender before embarking on additional purchasing.\\nOffers for April Middle East positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps April 9 at $255/mt FOB were countered with bids at $250/mt FOB. The bid-offer spread for May was $253/mt-$255/mt FOB. June was however posted at $240-$244/mt FOB.\\nThe above scenario continues to suggest that Middle East product will feature prominently in the April 10 STC tender in India. The regional producers have access to freights for West Coast India significantly below\\nthe rates obtainable by sellers of Chinese product, and can also provide competitive pricing for smaller ports with slower terms for which premiums are historically paid by Indian importers.\\nDirect offers to STC are expected from PIC and Muntajat while SIUCI will likely provide cover to contract- holders. Saudi Arabian offers are not expected to feature prominently due to planned contract deliveries, including the upcoming Pakistan shipments, and Fertil may opt to await price-developments pursuant to the STC session.\\nAvailability from Qafco that was reduced via the unplanned ammonia outages at Qafco III, V and VI has improved, with all units returned to regular operations in recent days. Sabic still reports that the Safco V urea unit is only expected to reach commercial output in mid-May only.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nPakistan: ECC urea import clearance still awaited\\nNews from Pakistan\\'s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on the clearance of a new urea tender for the planned import of up to 350,000 mt urea had yet to emerge at press time.\\nThe ECC will be meeting again shortly to clear the procurement and provide the necessary funding. As previously reported, the tender has been cleared by the Fertilizer Review Committee in order to cover the shortfall from the domestic industry due to curtailments in the supply of natural gas.\\nIndia: STC tender-offers eagerly awaited\\nAs already expressed, the April 10 STC session will undoubtedly attract significant selling interest, and speculation on prices obtainable by the importer remains rife.\\nChinese urea will feature prominently, but recent aggressive quotes from Middle East producers in Brazil and the US are indicative of offers into India well below current prices in China.\\nLatest Brazilian sales provide netbacks to the Middle East around $240/mt FOB. Should producers be willing to offer accordingly in India, these suggest possible offers from regional suppliers to India below $255/mt CFR West Coast India (WCI). Applying the former, historical spread between WCI and East Coast India (ECI) of about $3/mt in favour of ECI, this would in turn imply that bids to Chinese suppliers would be no higher than $258/mt CFR, for Chinese producer-netbacks in the mid $240s/mt FOB.\\nWhile pressure to relieve inventories and disposing of April and May production will be considerable, the level suggested may be termed unrealistically low by Chinese producers, leaving the door open for Iran and traditional Middle East suppliers to India, possibly also to some tonnage from the Black Sea.\\nSome market participants expressed concern over STC\\'s added payment condition that effectively states that STC will only effect payment to suppliers once STC is in receipt of payment from the DoF. The vast majority of suppliers would however not consider shipping material to STC unless a fully workable LC is in hand and will therefore not be affected by the procedure invoked, except for shipping delays as may incur.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nThailand: Urea activity slow despite drop in prices\\nActivity in granular urea remains sidelined despite offers for good quality material cited at an even $270/mt CFR. Importers contend that cover could be secured closer to $260/mt CFR.\\nImports of urea into Thailand of a mere 36,000 mt in February were down by 80% on February 2014. Malaysia accounted for 20,000 mt and imports from Indonesia were 9,400 mt.\\nThe limited February volume brought January-February imports to 177,600 mt, down by 37.2% on the same period in 2014. Saudi Arabia retained the lead with deliveries of 98,000 mt, but that volume was down by 30% on the prior year. Malaysian shipments were down to 39,000 mt while deliveries from Indonesia were up by 48% to 18,000 mt.\\nSouth Korea: Koch reportedly books Namhae granular urea tender\\nKoch was widely linked with the sale of 6,000 mt granular urea to Namhae via the importer\\'s April 2 tender. Details on the transaction were not released, but local reports indicate the deal was closed around $278/mt CFR, suggesting a netback close to an even $260/mt FOB for product to load from China.\\nDongbu has meanwhile floated another tender for the purchase of 6.000 mt granular urea, set to close April 10.\\nChina: Producers resist low prices, but traders still selling\\nMainstream offers for prilled urea for export are being maintained by producers around the $265/mt FOB marker ahead of the April 10 STC tender in India, but traders appear confident that cover will be available for the session in the mid- to upper-$250s/mt FOB by the time offers are to be submitted. Offers for granular urea are cited around an even $275/mt FOB, but recent regional deals point to netbacks some $15/mt lower. Producers maintain that such sales are speculative, and claim no interest in covering traders that may have shorted the market.\\nWhile prices have been slipping further in the domestic market this week, the netbacks to producers for prilled and granular urea are significantly higher than those perceived in export deals.\\nMainstream offers in Shandong were down by about $3/mt equivalent to RMB 1,530-1,560/mt ($247-252/mt) EXW and to RMB 1,500-1,530/mt ($242-247/mt) EXW in Henan. Deals in Shanxi were booked at RMB 1,470/mt ($237/mt) FCA. The low end reflected an export value for the prills in the low $280s/mt FOB.\\nA similar spread was also evident in granular urea where repeat domestic deals were claimed at RMB 1,550- 1,570/mt ($250-253/mt) FCA in Shanxi. These reflected export values for granular above $290/mt FOB.\\nInventories are assessed above last week, with about 900,000 mt combined of prilled and granular urea available for prompt shipment from key ports.\\nNetbacks on possible sales of Chinese material in India appear set to move significantly below even the more aggressive numbers in the mid $250s/mt FOB indicated by traders. Product from Iran and traditional Middle East producers may well feature in the STC session at CFR levels that would necessitate cover from China in the low $240s/mt FOB if STC targets in the $250s/mt CFR were to be achieved.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nFirm AS prices as availability still tight\\nAmmonium Sulphate\\nPrices have remained firm amid reduced availability across the board.\\nChinese product is still reported available at $128-129/mt FOB as several Chinese plants go down for planned maintenance this month.\\nMarginal volumes of caprolactam grade AS are available in the Black Sea if needed in the low $150s/mt FOB but no fresh uptake was noted. Steel grade is on offer from Arcelor with prices still pegged in the low $130s/mt FOB. Turkish interest is modest with Igsas issuing an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS closing April 10.\\nBrazilian AS demand has weakened with enquiries likely to increase in May for the summer application season. Helm is linked to the sale of 15,000 mt ex-China caprolactam grade AS into the country at $158/mt CFR in combination with a DAP/MAP cargo.\\nUAN\\nSmall volumes of UAN-30 are still being sold into France for prompt delivery at €228-229/mt FCA. Forward sales are moving more slowly with the latest business done still around €195/mt FCA.\\nGiven the relative lack of interest in large volumes for prompt delivery into Europe at present, Abu Qir managed to sell just 4,000 mt UAN-32 slightly below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender. This is at least $30/mt below the producer\\'s previous award in its February 17 session.\\nAmmonium Nitrate/CAN\\nThe distinctly softer undertone prevails solid nitrates sourced from the FSU, with confirmed deals a few dollars from both sides of the $230/mt FOB marker for Russian AN from the Baltic this week, and similar indications from the Black Sea.\\nThe slide in values appears set to continue, and prospects are for netbacks below $220/ mt FOB in coming weeks.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: AS holds ground as other nitrogens slip\\nAmmonium sulphate supply remains short in the Midwest, due mostly to reported production hiccups in the US. Distributors in the Midwest are holding out for $320/st FOB in many cases as spot outages are being reported. Higher quotes are likely in some areas.\\nUS Midwest: UAN deliveries starting to stack up ahead of season\\nLogistics ahead of seasonal demand for UAN already has applied some downward pressure on UAN in the Midwest. Distributors report efforts to find storage space for UAN have forced them to offer more aggressive prices rather than rack up substantial demurrage bills for tank cars. The impact has not been felt in the truck markets, as the difficulty is in finding homes for multiple railcars or even barge volumes. As a result, postings to retailers remain around $10/unit FOB across much of the region.\\nUS: AN arrivals roughly even with prior year during July-February\\nAmmonium nitrate imports have been relatively steady this fertilizer year when compmared to one year earlier, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, even though the US has trailed some international values for much of the July-February period. Market watchers are assuming the steady import trend in the face of discouraging pricing was due in part to some key importers choosing to meet their customer base\\'s needs through their historical channels. But declining US demand for non-industrial AN should start to show up in import volumes in coming months.\\nUS AN imports during February were 74,546 st (67,628 mt), down moderately from 84,502 st (76,660 mt) in February 2014. Almost all of the most recent month\\'s imports arrived from the Netherlands at 43,933 st and Canada at 29,999 st.\\nJuly-February AN arrivals in the current fertilizer year were up modestly from the prior year period at 358,873 st (325,567 mt) versus 341,041 st (309,390 mt). Key suppliers during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February were Canada at 267,082 st, the Netherlands at 66,236 st and Georgia at 20,723 st.\\nExports\\nWhile imports have been somewhat static, the US export market during July-February was up over 18% compared to the prior year period. February exports were roughly flat at 35,635 st (32,327 mt) versus 35,444 st (32,154 st). Canada was the primary destination for US AN exports during February at 23,586 st.\\nHowever, for the first eight months of the current fertilizer year through February versus the prior year period exports increased to 338,111 st (306,732 mt) from 288,775 st (261,975 mt). Key destinations for US AN included Canada at 185,200 st and Mexico at 71,526 st.\\nUS: AS imports up, exports down\\nHigher ammonium sulphate imports in the first eight months of the current fertilizer year and lower exports reflect anecdotal reports in recent months about the tight supply of AS due to greater demand.\\nHowever, despite the overal gain in imports during July-February, February 2015 arrivals in the US were down from February 2014 at 45,318 st (41,112 mt) versus 65,186 st (59,136 mt), according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. Canada and China supplied almost all the imported AS in February, at 29,488 st and 15,713 st respectively.\\nThis brought July-February arrivals to 265,353 st (240,727 mt) compared to 216,068 st (196,015 mt) for the prior year period. Key suppliers to the US throughout July-February of the current fertilizer year included Canada at 154,542 st and China at 109,191 st.\\nExports\\nAS exports from the US were off marginally in February 2015 compared to February 2014 at 108,664 st (98,579 mt) and 115,908 st (105,151 mt) respectively. Brazil at 39,685 st and Canada at 18,993 st were the largest destinations for US AS in February. For the first eight months of the US fertilizer year, exports fell to 898,933 st (815,507 mt) from 1.03 million st (932,020 mt) during the prior year period. Key distinattions for US export AS were mostly in the Americas during July-February of this year, including Brazil at 443,166 st, Peru at 108,267 st, Canada at 58,363 st and the Dominican Republic at 57,551 st.\\nUS: February UAN imports decline still leaves July- February arrivals in surplus\\nUS UAN imports slowed substantially in February compared to the prior fertilizer year, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce. However, the one-month drop still leaves arrivals during the first eight months of the current fertilizer year well ahead of the same period during 2013/2014. The causes for the drop in US arrivals were US importers reducing their bids at a time when other European demand was expected to increase.\\nFebruary imports totaled 337,767 st (306,420 mt) compared to 479,963 st (435,420 mt) one year earlier. The majority of the reduction was seen in shipments from two key US suppliers. February arrivals this year from Trinidad and Tobago fell to 40,228 st from 117,995 st, while imports from Russia fell to 82,906 st versus 163,858 st. Canadian arrivals were up over the relevant months to 45,564 st from 26,947 st.\\nThe February 2015 volume brought the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year\\'s imports to 2.21 million st (2 million mt) versus 1.89 million st (1.72 million mt) for the prior year period. The key traditional suppliers remained the same year over year, with imports from Russia reaching 784,538 st during July- February, followed by Trinidad and Tobago at 502,877 st and Canada at 311,998 st. China, a relative newcomer to the US market, supplied 239,048 st in imports during July-February\\nExports\\nUS UAN exports in February were relatively modest at 51,024 st (46,289 st). The destination for 44,311 st of the total was France. July-February export cargos were 263,882 st (239,392 mt). France at 145,471 st and Argentina at 41,868 st were the primary destinations for US UAN, with CF Industries believed to have suppiled all the US exported UAN.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nCentral America: Incofe to test AN values April 10\\nAs was indicated in prior issues, Incofe opted to tender April 10 for 10,000 mt AN in combination with 20,000 mt prilled FSU urea and an optional 5,000 mt granular urea for first half May shipment. The 10,000 mt AN is to be split between Cortes/Honduras (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala (4,000 mt). The prilled urea is to be delivered to Cortes (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (5,000 mt). The optional 5,000 mt granular urea is destined for Limon/Costa Rica.\\nBrazil: AS demand dips before summer season\\nBrazilian demand for AS has decreased slightly with an expectation that enquiries will increase from May in line with the summer application season.\\nHelm is reported to have sold up to 15,000 mt ex-China caprolactam grade AS into the country at $158/mt CFR in combination with a DAP/MAP cargo.\\nGranular product is priced at $220/mt CFR.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Only small AS volumes available\\nVery little caprolactam grade is reported available out of the Black Sea with small volumes from Kemerovo offered in the low $150s/mt FOB for April shipment.\\nArcelor closed an export tender for 2,000 mt steel grade AS Ukraine origin April 9 for June shipment. No details regarding bids were known at press time.\\n\\n(1)Kemerovo\\nFSU: Netbacks from key markets slide further\\nDeteriorating values of granular and prilled urea have combined with limited demand for FSU AN to trigger added competition for open business. Netbacks to suppliers are assessed sharply lower on demands for revised quotes from buyers that would require adjustments into the low $220s/mt FOB. Sellers are yet to concede numbers at that level, but the indicative assessment has been made at $228-238/mt FOB for the week.\\nEUROPE\\nFrance: Prompt UAN sales continue\\nA small number of sales for prompt tonnes continued this week at €228-229/mt FCA. Interest in forward sales remains limited for the time being with recent business struck around €195/mt FCA.\\nTurkey: Igsas issues AS tender\\nIgsas issued an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS closing April 10.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir sells small volume to Ameropa following tender\\nAbu Qir managed to sell just 4,000 mt UAN-32 marginally below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender. This is at least $30/mt below the producer\\'s previous award at $239.50/mt FOB in its February 17 session.\\nTraders had suggested it might be difficult to sell the cargo in Europe given that the tonnes might arrive too late for the current application season.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: AS prices very stable\\nChinese prices are reported stable at $128-129/mt FOB with few new enquries noted. Several plant shutdowns are taking place in April including Sinopec\\'s Baling facility.\\nAMMONIA\\nANALYSIS\\nContinued price pressure amid real lack of ammonia activity\\nTraders kept themselves busy with contract commitments in the absence of much new business this week. Lacklustre demand prevails as various market participants feel prices might dip further in April before recovering into May.\\nValues as low as $380/mt FOB Middle East are still considered representative of current market sentiment given on-going price pressure felt from India and the Far East. Recent planned maintenance shutdowns in India have reduced demand at a time when higher phosphoric acid prices are of a concern, and some buyers in the country are now insisting prices should be no higher than $420/mt CFR. Little support is felt in the Far East where buyers in no hurry to purchase are waiting for suppliers to lower spot offers to $450- 460/mt CFR to tempt them.\\nFaced with such limited demand it is perhaps surprising that Koch is attempting to sell its 40,000 mt Yuzhnny cargo into the Far East this week and not taking the tonnage to the US as was first suggested. SFC said it was still in discussions with Koch at press time for around 30,000 mt to arrive early May off the Clipper Neptun, although it was unclear whether this would be on a spot basis given the parties have an existing contract. Namhae ruled itself out as a buyer of the balance cargo with the likelihood that it would be directed to Taiwan for FPG Formosa.\\nShould lower values be secured by Asian buyers, substantial downwards pressure will be placed on prices west of Suez. This would mark a change to the rather remarkable stability of Black Sea values assessed unchanged at $400-410/mt FOB for six weeks. Little buying activity has been noted over that period with only the news that OPZ sold 23,000 mt to OCP marginally above $400/mt FOB punctuating the monotony this week.\\nShipments to the US Gulf overall should continue in a routine fashion in coming weeks, despite the planned curtailment in Trinidad and Tobago. However, Invista (a specialty chemical producer in Texas owned by Koch) has informed customers that its operations have been entirely shut down due to a malfunction April 5- 6. No further details were available at press time.\\nCF and some other suppliers are posting higher prices for inland US ammonia this week, presumably aimed at the late season side-dress market. These prices move ammonia costs per unit of nitrogen even further out in front of comparable granular urea values in the Midwest and elsewhere. Any shift to urea and away from\\nammonia for side-dress trade primarily used for corn likely would bring the two products into balance by boosting urea use. However, US producers may be raising their ammonia price tags in part to support their UAN postings. Inland UAN postings have changed little while urea has fallen substantially in recent weeks. It remains to be seen if higher ammonia costs do anything to prevent UAN from falling once the application season for that product opens in May-June.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Bad weather delays Black Sea vessel loading\\n∙OPZ sells 23,000 mt to OCP in low $400s/mt FOB\\n∙Koch\\'s Clipper Neptun now likely fixed for Far East\\n∙SFC discussing 30,000 mt cargo with Koch\\n∙Qafco ammonia lines III,V and VI now running\\n∙Indian values slip further to $420/mt CFR\\n∙Little progress made on Tampa May price tag talks\\nShort term outlook\\nLittle change from last week, as ammonia values east and west of Suez remain in danger of falling further owing to market pressure and weak demand.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nThe biggest potential danger to a rebound in global ammonia values in the near term likely is the declining fortunes of DAP and MAP. Global phosphate producers may curtail their production if Q2-Q3 demand from Brazil and India does not support stronger prices for DAP and MAP.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices inched up further this week, continuing their recent recovery and reaching $1,670- 1,700/mt CFR China. Prices may gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Only anticipation left before May ammonia talks get underway\\nThere is little to do in the US Gulf market but wait for Mosaic and Yara to begin negotiations over Tampa pricing to cover May shipments. Presumably talks will get under way in the next couple of weeks. There would seem to be little doubt that Yara and other suppliers will boost their demands above the $485/mt CFR Tampa price tag covering Mosaic\\'s deliveries to Tampa during April. However, as noted likely it seems Mosaic would like to claw back some of its costs given the decline in DAP pricing in the US and overseas.\\nUS Midwest: Severe weather hampering ammonia application again\\nThere is very little difference between winter storms and spring storms regarding their impact on ammonia applications in the Midwest. This week spring flash floods and tornados have replaced winter\\'s ice storms and snow from Kansas through Indiana.\\nIn much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Missouri work was stopped in its tracks, leaving distributors and retailers to wait for the ground to dry out again. On the other hand in the northern reaches of Illinois and Indiana corn planting is underway. Ammonia movement in Iowa and Nebraska has been more vigorous, and as much as two-thirds of the ammonia pre-plant material has been applied in those states.\\nAs previously noted, almost all the ammonia available for field work at this stage was purchased under forward programs, leaving the spot market in the region relatively untested. However, distributors east of the Mississippi especially are optimistic about demand for nitrogen for use as side-dress once the corn comes up. Ammonia is arguably over-priced compared to urea in the Midwest, but retailers are likely to raise prices for urea if demand for that product increases for side-dress applications.\\nFor now quotes east of the Mississippi River for new ammonia remain as high as $630/st FOB to retailers, while values generally are closer to $610/st FOB.\\nUS: February ammonia imports move US ahead of prior fertilizer year arrivals\\nUS ammonia imports have exceeded the prior fertilizer year through February thanks to a moderate increase in arrivals during that month compared to February 2014, according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce.\\nArrivals in the US during February 2015 were 462,500 st (419,311mt), up substantially from 323,747 st (293,701 mt) one year earlier. The increase was split between the two primary ammonia suppliers to the US, Canada at 103,589 st--up from 59,687 st one year earlier and Trinidad and Tobago at 345,176 st--up from 233,779 st.\\nThese gains pushed the US import volume for July-February modestly ahead of the prior-year period, at 3.79 milliont st (3.43 million mt) versus 3.67 million st (3.33 million mt). There was very little variation in volumes among the major suppliers to the US during the first eight months of the current US fertilizer year through February versus the prior-year period. Most of the imports during the most recent period arrived from Trinidad and Tobago at 2.49 million st, Canada at 721,422 st, Russia at 222,805 st and Venezuela at 196,122 st.\\nThe US export total through February of the current fertilizer year was 60,601 st (54,977 mt), down substantially from 124,799 st (113,217 mt) during the first eight months of the prior year. Primary destinations for US ammonia during July-February of this year were South Korea at 42,215 st and Chile at 11,026 st. February exports this year and last year were negligible.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Unfavourable weather prompts Yuzhnny port closure\\nHeavy winds prompted the closure of Yuhznny port in recent days leading to delays in vessel loading.\\nIt emerged this week that OPZ recently fixed the Gaschem Stade for a voyage to Morocco towards the end of April after a sale to OCP was concluded at $400-405/mt FOB.\\nDespite renewed suggestions that the on-going dispute between the owners of the Russia-Ukraine ammonia pipeline and OPZ was affecting product deliveries from late last week, it is now reported that an agreement has been reached covering transactions over the next two months.

The consensus is this could be around $450/mt CFR.\\nSFC said it will receive 25,000 mt contract tonnage from Yara off the Viking River in April, followed by 23,000 mt from Sabic in May.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nMarket dominated by expectations due to thin volume of trades\\nMost major suppliers are waiting for the calendar to bring importers in Brazil and India back to the marketplaces, leaving endusers in other markets to pick off cargoes offered by those producers feeling inventory pressure in the near term.\\nThis enabled buyers to convince Russia\\'s EuroChem to meet marketplace expectations for a DAP/MAP cargo for Argentina and to lead to further expectations that new business to Argentina/Uruguay would have to be even cheaper.\\nTraders working in Brazil\\'s market said carryover sitting in warehouses in that country means any new spot cargoes would have to be priced at least $10/mt below current offer levels and it seems unlikely such business would do much more than lead to even lower price demands on subsequent shipments.\\nAs previously reported, India\\'s last round of buying has left it comfortable in the near term, especially given the drop in value of the rupee against the US dollar. As the Chinese domestic season for phosphate applications winds down towards the end of this month or early May, port inventories in that country are expected to embolden buyers for India to make bids below $480/mt CFR, especially if Saudi output is building. US export giant Mosaic may also participate with June cargoes, as returns at $480/mt CFR are not far below current US barge values.\\nIf there is good news here for suppliers it is that low prices inevitably are the cure for low prices. India\\'s clout means whatever price is concluded for that market typically sets the floor during Q2 and Q3 for global values. Other buyers can expect to see higher demands once Indian buying returns.\\nIn the US domestic market, sales of imported DAP continue at a few dollars either side of $410/st FOB, the equivalent of $452/mt FOB US Gulf, suggesting Mosaic likely will come down to meet Brazilian expectations once pricing there is more settled. For now the producer is happy to holdout at a higher export indication until most of the US seasonal demand is met.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Argentina/Uruguay aim to pick off cheaper offers while others on side line\\n∙Saudi continues to sell cargoes at top of range to India\\n∙Rumours continue of US DAP cargoes for Q2-Q3 shipment to India\\n∙SE Asia DAP sales completed across wide range\\n∙European contract price talks for phosacid finally underway, maybe\\nTwo key enduser markets, the US and China, will have met their seasonal demands in coming weeks. This will leave producers in those countries to consider their price demands primarily on the backs of how much DAP/MAP is worth in India and Brazil. While this should lead to lower prices in May, it should also set the stage for a rebound as those endusers sweep up the lowest priced DAP and MAP. The combination of international sales and empty domestic systems in the US and China should enable suppliers to seek higher prices later in the summer.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Weather interrupts DAP work across much of region\\nAfter some positive reports with regard to demand last week, less phosphate application work was reported in recent days as storms including tornados moved through the Corn Belt.\\nIndications for DAP in Illinois and Iowa are as low as $460-465/st FOB this week, but quotes are a further $5-10/st higher from warehouses limited to resupply by rail.\\nUS Southern Plains: Flat while wet weather prevails\\nDAP is not moving in significant volumes so far this week, as much of the region outside of Texas is too wet for field work. Distributors are more optimistic that ground conditions will have improved by late next week. In the meantime, postings still are cited at $460-480/st FOB, but expectations are that most business will be completed at the low end of this range.\\nUS New Orleans: Market divided between up-river, Gulf indications\\nBusiness has been done at $405-410/st FOB New Orleans this week for DAP barges discharging in the US Gulf, but barges already moving north have changed hands at $415-420/st FOB, according to some traders. Nevertheless, despite some bullishness for barges available off tows already moving along the Mississippi River system, bids are lower for load dates or barges still in the Gulf. Bids for these positions, albeit so far unsuccessful this week, have been made at $400-405/st FOB.\\nUS Tampa: Brazil not interested in DAP/MAP offers, India rumours continue\\nMosaic reported no new export trade this week, following last week when the only business cited by the producer was priced on a formula for Latin America. Expectations are that Mosaic and some other global producers are waiting for greater interest late next month from Brazil. In recent weeks Mosaic has little interest in competing for business in Argentina and other markets that will likely only lower price expectations further in key Brazilian trade.\\nMeanwhile, rumours persist that Mosaic is trying to build an export line-up to its own system in India and other importers in that country. Expectations are that the producer might load two large cargos through June, but so far Mosaic has declined to comment on the speculation. Likely returns from India given current prices in that country and the weakness in the prompt US market make India a reasonable alternative for the US producer in coming weeks.\\nIn the meantime, the US Tampa benchmark likely is not better than $470/mt FOB, assuming small cargoes to Central America still could yield higher returns than are indicated for Brazil and elsewhere.\\nUS: DAP and MAP arrivals jumped in February\\nImporters showed improved timing in February, bringing 95,639 st (86,763 mt ) of DAP and 28,427 st\\n( 25,789 mt) of MAP to the US just a few weeks ahead of the annual re-opening of the upper Mississippi River system, according to the US Department of Commerce. One year earlier February DAP arrivals were just 2,341 st (2,124 mt) and MAP imports totaled just 3,024 st (2,743 mt).\\nAlmost all of February 2015\\'s DAP imports and also all of the gain between the relevant months was credited to imports from Morocco of 60,186 st and Russia of 33,191 st. MAP imports were almost entirely concentrated in Russian hands in February 2015, with 24,771 st discharging from that country.\\nDAP arrivals during July-February also were up compared to the prior year period at 448,516 st (406,891 mt). China took the lion\\'s share of this trade, with 282,224 st imported mostly during July-December. Russia supplied 76,485 st of DAP during July-February. MAP imports in the first eight months of the US fertilizer\\nyear through February were 904,090 st (820,185 mt), compared to 296,770 st (269,228 mt). International MAP suppliers to the US inclued Morocco at 326,597 st, China at 253,162 st and 236,845 st.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Bids and offers may remain far apart until May\\nBrazil\\'s market is weighed down by carryover from the prior season, a weak domestic currency versus the US dollar and strikes in the transportation industries.\\nBids and offers for new MAP and DAP cargoes in Brazil are at least $10/mt apart and neither buyers nor sellers expect to see that situation change until May, and new cargoes may not discharge before June in significant volumes.\\nImporters are looking to buy from US, Russian or North African suppliers at $465/mt CFR for MAP and DAP today, a value that likely will not be accepted by those sellers in the near term. Offers are suggested at $475/mt CFR for now, and Chinese material is indicated even higher.\\nArgentina/Uruguay: Trader buys DAP/MAP cargo, price tags still inching down\\nEuroChem sold 20,000 mt MAP and 20,000 mt DAP on a single cargo to load for Argentina and Uruguay in April.\\nWhile details are sparse, a previous purchase by Profertil below $480/mt CFR suggests this latest business was around $475/mt CFR for both products. This indicates a return to EuroChem of about $445/mt FOB whether it loads from the Black Sea or the Baltic, and assuming a margin for the trader involved, rumoured to be Nitron.\\nWhile EuroChem still has some April availability, a planned turnaround at its Kingisepp plant in May will limit forward availability, and may allow it to focus on its higher-priced customers in Europe, rather than selling further afield in the coming weeks.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Weak levels of NPK activity\\nNPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.\\nWeak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers\\' buying side have all impacted NPK demand and even the reduced prices are failing to attract buyers.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.\\nWith OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.\\nWe have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in the Indian market, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.\\nEurope: Phosacid negotiations expected\\nThe market still awaits news of Q2 phosphoric acid contract negotiations for Europe. The main players were unavailable for comment this week, indicating talks may be underway.\\nEurope: Europe DAP demand all but over\\nThe DAP season over in France and the southern part of West Europe, and the end is approaching in Germany, though the season will continue through April for corn application.\\nEurochem is expected to announce a new price for April but in the meantime DAP prices, almost exclusively Lithuanian, are holdiing in the range of $525-530/mt FCA Terneuzen.\\nSome limited demand for DAP in the local truck markets reported.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: 40,000 mt rock cargo will be country\\'s first higher-grade export\\nEgypt is nearing its first ever export sale of higher grade phosphate rock with a 40,000 mt cargo expected to load within days.\\nA vessel is understood to be on its way to Safaga on the Red Sea coast.\\nThe shipment, negotiated through a trader at an undisclosed price, will be delivered to India. The buyer has not been named.\\nMisr Phosphate was awarded a licence last year by the Egyptian government to operate the Red Sea Mine, previously held by Red Sea Mining Corp.\\nMisr began management of the site in September 2014 and plans to increase production to as much as 100,000 mt/month phosphate rock (30-32% P2O5 or 66-70% BPL). There are currently stocks at the mine of about 250,000 mt.\\nEgypt has taken steps to become more competitive in the global phosphate rock market by redistributing some mining licences.

With the European season almost over, the Tunisians are likely to be concentrating on talks with Turkish buyers.\\nAs of last week, Morocco\\'s OCP was indicating $515/mt FOB in Southern Europe, which may mean a deal close to $505-510/mt FOB is possible. GCT likely will aim to match the same range.\\nSaudi Arabia: Ma\\'aden and Sabic agree Indian sales\\nMa\\'aden is now fully committed through April and early May after agreeing recent sales into India.\\nMa\\'aden sold a 30,000 mt DAP cargo to Kribcho in India at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April.\\nA second cargo from the Saudi producer of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.\\nMa\\'aden says it is now fully committed through April and early May but has received enquiries from May onwards from India, Pakistan, East Africa and South America. The company\\'s last shipment to Latin America was to Yara and priced on a formula.\\nThe seller last week indicated it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business into Pakistan.\\nUnder a recent MoU, Sabic sold a second DAP cargo to Zuari of 30-35,000 mt at about $485-86/mt CFR India with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced similarly at $485- 486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.\\nMa\\'aden has now signed contracts with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered between April this year and March, 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment.\\nMorocco: OCP plans for Brazil still unclear\\nAs reported last week, OCP plans to switch its attention to increased phosacid and NPS shipments through April.\\nFollowing on from last month\\'s settlement of phosacid prices in India, OCP will now focus its attention on shipping increased volumes of acid from Morocco. It will ship reduced quantities of DAP/MAP in April while balancing granulation according to demand. The final three 50,000 mt NPS shipments for Ethiopia will be loaded through April/May along with additional NPKs for Nigeria and West Coast Africa, as detailed in last week\\'s report.\\nDAP/MAP production will be limited with just 20-30,000 mt allocated for the European market and nothing firm as yet for Brazil. Serious phosphate demand in Brazil is widely said to be 30-40 days away.\\nAfter loading 260,000 mt for the US in February/March, it is believed OCP plans no more US April shipments but has allocated 1-2 cargoes for Q2.\\nOCP indicated a price last week for DAP of $515/mt FOB for Europe.\\nQ2 discussions for phosphoric acid into the Northwest European market are expected to be taking place imminently.\\nKenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender\\nThe Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.\\nSingapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.\\nYara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR.

A production period of 28 days is required once the letter of credit has been issued.\\nThe original tender was for 69,000 mt.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Rock imports to date for April reach 333,000 mt\\nIndian imports of phosphate rock in April are so far scheduled to reach 333,000 mt. The full line-up to date is as follows:\\nIndia Phosphate Rock Arrivals, 2015\\nBangladesh: BCIC awards 30,000 mt rock tender\\nWilson International won BCIC\\'s, awarded on April 9, for 30,000 mt 72% BPL minimum phosphate rock, with its offer of Jordanian rock $159.43/mt CFR Chittagong. The rock will feed the phosphoric acid unit at BCIC\\'s TSP plant.\\nIndia: MFL receives two offers in phosacid tender\\nMFL received two offers in its 10,000 mt phosphoric acid tender from Sterlite and Aries. The offers are likely to open in the next one or two days. The tender was due to close on April 6.\\nThe latest phosacid arrivals in India are as follows:\\nIndia: Phosphoric acid Arrivals – February/March/April 2015\\nPakistan: Still no new DAP sales confirmed\\nFirming freights have meant producers have increased their price ideas for product delivered into Karachi.\\nSaudi\\'s Ma\\'aden indicated last week it was seeking $500/mt CFR for new business in Pakistan.\\nIndia: Three April Saudi DAP cargoes confirmed\\nSome new business was reported this week to India from Saudi Arabia even as buyers awaited an annoucement on the new NBS rates.\\nLast year the NBS rates were announced on April 4 but not until May 2 in 2013.\\nKribhco confirmed it purchased a 30,000 mt cargo of Saudi DAP from Ma\\'aden at $489/mt CFR for delivery at the end of April. A second Ma\\'aden cargo of about 35,000 mt was also sold into India at the same price for loading in the second half of April. Market sources suggest the buyer was IPL, though this could not be confirmed at the time of writing.\\nThese two sales increase the top end of the DAP Bulk CFR India Spot price by $3/mt. The benchmark is now assessed at $480-489/mt CFR.\\nZuari has bought a second cargo of 30-35,000 mt from Sabic (under an MoU) at about $485-486/mt CFR with delivery expected by April 20. The first cargo of 30-35,000 mt was also priced at $485-486/mt CFR Mundra, according to sources, and arrived in the last week of March.\\nMa\\'aden has now agreed MoUs with three Indian buyers for 700,000 mt to be delivered\\nbetween April this year and March 2016. The price will be negotiated before each shipment. The exact division is unclear though Kribcho has agreed to take about 250,000 mt, Zuari will take 100,000 mt leaving a third buyer, thought to be IPL, with about 350,000 mt.\\nPhosAgro is visiting several buyers including IPL/IFFCO and the two companies are considering the purchase of two to three DAP cargoes once clarity emerges over the NBS.\\nPrice ideas for Chinese DAP are around $480 CFR with Saudi product in the mid-to-high $480s/mt CFR.\\nRCF is expected to take another one or two days to finalise its DAP tender.\\nWith regard to the MRP, the current range for most producers is between INR 23,300-23,800/mt. IFFCO has maintained a lower MRP through Q1 at INR 23,200 but is planning to increase this by INR 500/mt to INR 23,700/mt. TCL, one of OCP\\'s JV partners, is heard to have raised its MRP already to INR 24,260/mt.\\nIndia: January DAP imports up nearly 40%\\nIndia imported 116,781 mt of DAP in January, a 39% increase on January 2013, according to GTIS data.\\nIn January, Saudi Arabia supplied 65,810 mt or 56% of the total import volume, while the US supplied 50,970 mt or 44% of the total import volume.\\nGTIS data for the full calendar year 2014 showed Indian DAP imports at 3.8 million mt, higher than 2013 when just 3.6 million mt were imported. Imports over the previous four calendar years had averaged 5.5 million mt DAP.\\nIndia imported 199,788 mt of phosacid in January, an 83% increase on its January 2014 imports, according to GTIS data. Almost 80% of the imports came from OCP which limited its export shipments to only its joint venture partners during Q1. For Q2 it is expecting to increase volumes to a level similar to Q4 2014 when around 100-120,000 mt P2O5 per month was supplied from Morocco.\\nIndia: January NPK imports at 2-year high\\nIndia imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.\\nIn January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.\\nIn the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.\\nNPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Phosphate prices showing signs of further weakness\\nChinese phosphate prices are showing further signs of weakness as major MAP demand in Brazil is yet to emerge and domestic DAP consumption is currently limited. Exports are expected to be high through April.\\nPhosphate and NPK producers in China can comfortably afford the current sulphur price, but are holding off as they anticipate sulphur will decline further in the weeks ahead.\\nConcern among sulphur suppliers at the lack of Chinese demand is causing producers to drop prices, but this is yet to stimulate a buy-side reaction. Chinese delivered sulphur is currently assessed at $150-160/mt CFR.\\nSome Chinese phosphate producers have planned maintenance in April and May, so operating rates are expected to decline in May, with normal production expected to resume from late June.\\nDistributors and traders say small and mid-tier phosphate companies may delay maintenance as they seek to supply the export market from April, rather than from late May/June. These smaller producers are likely to produce at rates of around 80% to maximise exports.\\nFor the largest producers (such as YTH and Wengfu), for whom maintenance was scheduled in May, plants are not expected take complete shutdowns. Operating rates are instead likely to drop to 60-70% from 80% for three or four weeks, before normal production is resumed.\\nExports to India between February and April will have been comparatively high due to a need by Indian importers to replenish stocks ahead of the next season and on the Chinese side, facilitated by the removal of seasonal export restrictions from the beginning of 2015. The weaker RMB has also encouraged Chinese suppliers to take advantage of additional export opportunities.\\nThe lower end of DAP Bulk FOB China Spot is assessed by Fertilizer Week as slightly lower on last week at $460-470/mt FOB. Most large producers have booked their production through April and don\\'t have product available for prompt sale. However, domestic DAP sales are said to be very slow, not just for seasonal reasons but also due to the price advantage MAP and NPKs currently hold over DAP.\\nSome regional markets such as Northwest China, demand has been postponed due to extreme weather conditions. Ploughing time has been pushed back by at least one or two weeks. Demand in Northern and Northeast China is also limited.\\nProducers will not currently move much volume to ports as they do not expect to see a sharp increase in monthly shipments in April or May, hence there has been no obvious growth of port inventory.\\nAs seen last week, MAP remains under pressure. Chinese granular 11-44-0 can sell at $350-360/mt FOB, according to sources in China, with granular MAP 10-50-0 at around $405/mt FOB. MAP Bagged EXW 11- 44-0 is assessed at RMB 1,900-2,000/mt, a decline of about RMB 125/mt week on week, with 10-50-0 at RMB 2,100-2,200/mt, down RMB 75/mt on last week.\\nMajor buyers are still said to be traders rather than end users with demand and supply roughly balanced. No negotiations are not yet under way for deliveries after mid May.\\nSome traders are reportedly eyeing exports to the US of granular 10-50-0 or 11-52-0 for June onwards, but no business was heard to have been concluded at the time of writing.\\nIndonesia: NPK imports double in 2014\\nIndonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country\\'s highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.\\nNPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.\\nThe country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.\\nVietnam: Australian DAP bought at $500 CFR\\nIncitec Pivot is reported to have sold a cargo of around 20,000 mt Australian DAP into Vietnam at $500/mt CFR for end April loading. The producer was not immediately available to confirm the trade.\\nElsewhere in Vietnam, cargoes of bagged DAP were traded at $490/mt CFR Ho Chi Minh and cross-border trade with China was reported at $475-480/mt CFR.\\nPOTASH\\nANALYSIS\\nSuppliers struggle to raise potash prices as market awaits Indian contract\\nPrices are generally stable in the potash spot markets this week as players continue to await news on the new Indian contract and suppliers struggle to achieve higher prices after a disappointing Q1.\\nBPC, Canpotex and APC have now signed firm quantities of 1.7 million, 1.8 million and 600,000 mt respectively in their contract talks with China. This follows BPC\\'s decision to sign a $10/mt increase on the\\nprevious $305/mt CFR price ahead of Canpotex and Uralkali. The volumes represent strong demand with domestic producer QSL planning to increase sales volumes to 5.0 million mt this year.\\nSurprisingly, Uralkali is yet to agree quantities. Talks are almost concluded and an announcement should be made by early next week, a company spokesman said. The delay is because Uralkali is looking at the option of signing an agreement with three channels rather than its usual two (CNAMPGC and Sinofert) but Uralkali noted that it is not pushing for extra volumes than last year.\\nUralkali said this week that its Q1 production fell 8% year on year to 2.7 million mt and it may review its current production target for 2015.The company currently has a 10.2 million mt output target for 2015 following the Solikamsk-2 flood which represents a 15-16% fall on full-year 2014 production levels.\\nICL has yet to sign a deal, with some sources arguing that the company is awaiting an agreement with striking workers before negotiating volumes to China, which may be some time. Strikes which began in mid- February continue at the Dead Sea Works with little end in sight. With the total loss of operations at DSW during the strikes it is likely that ICL has foregone more than 500,000 mt of production already.\\nWhile prices in the spot markets are generally stable, Brazilian potash prices dipped further this week despite the Chinese contract. Brazilian prices have fallen to a dismal $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR last week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels forcing down the price. Brazilian values have now fallen by roughly $35-40/mt in the first four months of 2015 and suppliers\\' hopes of pushing above $350/mt in the near term are looking more and more unlikely.\\nEuropean prices are holding at the €300-310/mt CIF range with producers struggling to achieve €315/mt CIF amid high levels of resistance and a possible reduction in consumption. The standard potash price is currently seen around €275-280/mt CFR, a very weak price which translates to roughly $295/mt CFR at current exchange rates, far below the new $315/mt CFR Chinese contract price.\\nMalaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country until the next tender season in May. Indonesian and Vietnamese prices remain around $330-335/mt CFR and $340-345/mt CFR respectively.\\nAfter some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values in the US Midwest appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB. Prices at terminals along the Arkansas river are quoted at $390-395/st FOB but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week.\\nCanada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data. As a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.\\nThe potash market continues to await news on contract talks in India, with the Nutrient Based Subsidy rates still to be announced. Rates are expected by the end of next week and the contract should be signed shortly after. It is likely that the contract will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, at around $330- 337/mt CFR with 180 days. Suppliers will hope the new price can help them to push up spot prices through Q2.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙APC signs 600,00 mt volumes contract to China\\n∙Uralkali Q1 production falls 8% y-o-y, at 2.7 million mt\\n∙Uralkali may review 10.2 million mt out put target for 2015\\n∙Brazil gMOP price falls to $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR\\n∙European gMOP price stable, €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙SE ASIA price stable $315-345/mt CFR\\n∙US Midwest price firms, $390-400/st FOB\\n∙China domestic price stable, RMB 2,050-2,200/mt FCA\\n∙Canada exports up 32% in February at 1.5 million mt - GTIS\\n∙Indian MOP imports down 14% in February at 178,000 mt - FAI\\n∙Indonesia imported 2.9 million mt of MOP in 2014, up 29% - GTIS\\n∙MFL India gets two offers in 15,000 mt tender, IPL\\'s $324/mt CFR lowest\\n∙Indian NBS expected next week, contract to be signed by end of April\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the\\nAffordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to\\nthe crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly affordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\n\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 52\\n60 kt awarded to IPL; 30 kt firm awarded to MMTC; optional 30 kt awarded to MMTC.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: After last week\\'s start, field work slowed by more rain\\nGranular potash and other products still are being applied on higher ground in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but further rain this week cut into the trend towards greater field work seen last week. Texas still is seing good activity, and corn sowing is underway in that state.\\nQuotes for granular potash are $390-395/st FOB from terminals along the Arkansas River.\\nUS Midwest: Seasonal pricing for potash appears set\\nAfter some discounting earlier this season, granular potash values appear to have found firm footing a few dollars either side of $400/st FOB in the Midwest.\\nThis level likely will be challenged in coming weeks, as distributors are expected to cut values in order to end the season empty. This is due to the prevailing view that crop prices will decline in coming months, bringing pressure on all input costs for the fall season.\\nCanada: Potash exports at 3.0 million mt in Jan-Feb\\nCanada exported 1.5 million mt of potash in February, a 32% increase on February 2014 and the largest February exports since 2005, according to GTIS data.\\nAs a result, Canada has now exported 3.0 million mt of potash in the year to date, 28% more than the same period in 2014.\\nThe country exported 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nIncluding the exports from Portland, in February Canpotex exported 189,992 mt to Indonesia, 164,098 mt to China, 124,328 mt to Brazil, 72,393 mt to Malaysia and 58,121 mt to India.\\nCanada exported 17.3 million mt of potash in 2014, a 7.8% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly potash exports from the country since 2007. The country exported 9.2 million mt to the US in 2014, of which 2.5 million mt was re-exported out of the US from Portland.\\n\\n\\nUS: Potash imports up 30% in Jan-Feb\\nThe US imported 1.0 million mt of potash in February, 43% more than the same month a year earlier and the highest February imports since 2010, according to GTIS data.\\nThe figures bring US year-to-date imports to 2.0 million mt, a 30% increase on Jan-Feb 2013 levels.\\nCanadian producers sent 774,944 mt to the US in February, with 221,163 mt re-exported through Portland as part of the Canpotex agreement between PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic.\\nThe US also imported 107,191 mt from Uralkali, 66,175 mt from BPC, 34,945 mt from SQM and 24,610 mt from ICL.\\nTotal US imports reached 10.5 million mt of potash in 2014, 10% (1 million mt) more than in 2013. After tonnage was re-exported through Portland, net imports were 8.0 million mt.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Prices slip further despite Chinese contract\\nBrazilian prices have fallen to $325-345/mt CFR from $335-350/mt CFR last week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels forcing down the price.\\nBrazilian prices had seemed to have hit their floor at $335-345/mt CFR following the Chinese contract agreement but high levels of competition have continued to force down the key spot price. Brazilian prices have now fallen by roughly $35-40/mt in the first four months of 2015.\\nBrazilian real depreciation and low agricultural prices have hit Brazilian farmers, who invested heavily last year. As a result, distributers and importers are defending their margins and resisting any price push at this point.\\nMany suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt level.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: Belaruskali doubles choice of products to China\\nBelaruskali more than doubled the range of products it sold to China in 2014, Belarusian state news agency BelTA reported on April 8.\\nPreviously Belaruskali\\'s export arm BPC sold just three types of potassium chloride to China, but in 2014 the company sold seven types of product to China and it continues to diversify its merchandise line to the country.\\n\"Some headway has also been secured with regard to other new kinds of products that consumers may be interested in,\" BPC\\'s press service told BelTA.\\nBPC, which surprisingly signed a new Chinese contract at $315/mt CFR in March ahead of Uralkali and Canpotex, is now looking to increase its client base in China and to establish direct relationships with the manufacturers of compound fertilizers.\\nIn 2015, BPC is set to ship more than 1.7 million mt of potash to China after signing agreements with CNAMPGC, Sinochem and CNOOC. In 2014, China imported almost 1.8 million mt from BPC, more than double its imports from the Belarusian potash company in 2013.\\nRussia: Uralkali\\'s Q1 potash production falls 8%\\nRussian potash producer Uralkali has already been hit by lost volumes from its flooded SK-2 mine with production down 8% year on year in Q1, according to the company.\\nThe company produced 2.7 million mt of potash in Q1 compared with 2.93 million mt of potash in the same period a year earlier.\\nUralkali said production rates fell due to the flood at SK-2 and lower levels of demand in key markets. It added that the spring thaw at Solikamsk will add to water levels in the flooded mine making conditions more difficult.\\nUralkali may also review its 10.2 million mt output target for 2015 depending on demand in the market and further developments at the Solikamsk-2 mine. Uralkali produced 12.1 million mt in 2014.\\nThe company has pledged to keep its Solikamsk-1 mine, linked to the SK-2 site via an underground passageway, from flooding, Bloomberg reported today.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Weak levels of NPK activity\\nNPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.\\nWeak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks, cold weather and apprehension on the farmers\\' buying side have all impacted NPK demand. The lower prices are still failing to attract buyers.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.\\nWith OCP bringing on its new 1 million mt integrated granulation plant this month, Russian NP/NPK business will become ever more vulnerable to competition from Morocco, particularly in Africa.\\nWe have already begun to see increased Russian (PhosAgro and Acron) activity in India, a market that Russian producers have foregone in the last two years.\\nEurope: Prices hold at low level\\nEuropean granular prices remain in the €300-310/mt CIF range as suppliers continue to push for €315/mt CIF levels.\\nMost suppliers recently increased their granular prices to €315-320/mt FCA. More deals are being made at the €315/mt FCA level but we are still yet to see deals reach €320/mt FCA and suppliers have begun to note a possible reduction in consumption due to colder weather across Europe.\\nThe standard potash price is currently seen around €275/mt CFR, a very weak price which translates to roughly $295/mt CFR at current exchange rates, far below the new $315/mt CFR Chinese contract price.\\nSuppliers hope that weather issues are soon to improve and applications will build up, helping achieve target prices.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nKenya: KTDA awards 70,000 mt NPK tender\\nThe Kenya Tea Development Agency awarded its annual tender for about 70,000 mt NPK 26-5-5 to Mekatrade after receiving four offers.\\nSingapore-based Mekatrade will deliver product from Uralchem at $353.88/mt CFR Mombasa.\\nYara submitted the highest offer at $375/mt CFR.

March imports are expected at around 150,000 mt with most suppliers having already sent their entire contracted volumes and are looking to limit Indian shipments to help in contract negotiations.\\nNPK production between April and February reached 7.3 million mt, an increase on 6.5 million mt during the same period in the previous fertilizer year.\\nRising levels of NPK output mean increasing demand for potash, which is not produced in India, and this trend is expected to increase as DAP producers increase NPK production to offset high phosacid prices.\\nSource: FAI PIS\\nSource: FAI PIS\\nIndia: January NPK imports at 2-year high\\nIndia imported 39,525 mt of NPKs in January, its largest January figures since 2012 and more than half of its full-year 2014 NPK imports, according to GTIS data.\\nIn January, Russia supplied 38,455 mt, or 97% of the total import volume, a figure which is more than Russia provided in the whole of 2014.\\nIn the full year 2014, India only imported 65,286 mt of NPKs, with more than half coming from Russia. The high January imports may be a sign that India could signal a return to the levels of yearly NPK imports seen between 2010 and 2012.\\nNPK production in India between April 2014 and February is up by 13% at 7.3 million mt as DAP producers switched to NPKs in the face of higher phosphoric acid prices.\\nIndia: MFL receives two offers in potash tender\\nIndian fertilizer producer MFL has received two offers in its tender for 15,000 mt with a closing date of April 2.\\nThe company received an offer from IPL at $324/mt CFR and one from Uzagro at $330/mt CFR both with 180 days credit. MFL is likely to award the tender to IPL in the next couple of days.\\nRepresentatives in the country are currently in negotiations over a new contract deal for 2015. The current price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the IPL/Uzagro offers should help suppliers achieve a price increase.\\nThe tender is for delivery in April or May at Chennai port.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nAustralia: Wildhorse Energy to acquire Australia Salt Lake Potash\\nAIM and ASX listed Wildhorse Energy has agreed to acquire Australia Salt Lake Potash and its two SOP/SOPM exploration projects in Western Australia.\\nASLP\\'s Lake Wells and Lake Ballard projects are currently in the exploration stage with the preparation of an initial resource estimate planned for the coming months.\\nWildhorse is set to acquire 100% of ASLP\\'s shares, subject to approval by Wildhorse shareholders, via the issuance of 15 million Wildhorse shares at completion and a further 22.5 million performance shares if various performance conditions are met in the future.\\nWildhorse said the acquisition has \"excellent potential\" to produce SOP for domestic and international markets.\\nUpon completion of the deal, Wildhorse plans to undertake further drilling and testwork in order to move towards a scoping study for the site. Wildhorse may also provide ASLP with a limited loan facility in order to conduct some exploration work.\\nThe company currently holds four uranium exploration sites in Hungary and a uranium/vanadium project in the US. It is carrying out a restructuring plan to cease all activities in Europe and has been seeking new business opportunities for some time.\\nChina: Domestic MOP prices expected to keep falling\\nThe Chinese domestic standard MOP price remains stable this week at RMB 2,050-2,200/mt FCA but sources continue to expect port warehouse prices to continue their fall towards the new $315/mt CFR contract price.\\nPrices are quoted at RMB 2,050 ($331)/mt for red standard potash in Northern China but in the south red standard prices remain around RMB 2,100/mt due to limited fresh arrivals.\\nWhite standard potash prices are seen around RMB 2,150/mt and 62% K2O product is quoted at RMB 2,200/mt.\\nQSL is expected to adjust its price list soon with big sales agents and distributers said to be selling standard crystal MOP from QSL at RMB 2,100/mt CPT, an RMB 60/mt fall on QSL\\'s price at the start of this year.\\nLarge volumes are said to be coming into the country now following the new contract agreements while small to medium level potash producers are now restarting following winter maintenance. As a result supply is building and there are expectations that the domestic price could fall towards as low as RMB 2,030/mt FCA, leaving very little margin for importers.\\nSoutheast Asia: Spot prices still flat amid price push\\nMalaysian potash prices have been quoted stable this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices after settling the Chinese contract.\\nMalaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country.\\nSome suppliers recently said they were looking to increase prices towards the $330/mt CFR level in Malaysia and will hope these prices can be achieved in the May tender season. Some importers have noted more interest in prices above $315/mt CFR than in recent weeks.\\nIn Indonesia, the recent Sinar Mas tender for 100,000 mt is believed to have been extended but offers were made around $335/mt CFR. In addition, there are rumours that a significant tender for H2 delivery as high as 500,000 mt is soon to be announced by Petrokimia Gresik.\\nIn Vietnam, prices remain quoted at $340-345/mt CFR with only small deals. As a result, prices in Southeast Asia have increased to $320-345/mt CFR from $315-345/mt CFR last week.\\nIndonesia: NPK imports double in 2014\\nIndonesia imported 423,187 mt of NPKs in 2014, almost doubling its full-year figures from 2013 and the country\\'s highest yearly imports since 2008, according to GTIS.\\nNPK demand in Indonesia is steadily growing, partly to feed rising palm oil production.\\nThe country imported more than 50% of the NPK volumes from Malaysia, while 35%came from Norway.\\nTaiwan: Imports over 40,000 mt of MOP in January\\nTaiwan imported 42,725 mt of potash in January, a 22% year-on-year fall, but still high levels compared to the country\\'s normal average January imports, according to GTIS data.\\nThe country imported 24,000 mt from APC and 15,000 mt from Canpotex in January. APC provided less than 15,000 mt of potash to Taiwan in the whole of both 2014 and 2013.\\nTaiwan imported 387,992 mt of potash in 2014, a 37% increase on the previous year and its highest yearly potash imports on record.\\nIndonesia: Potash imports reach 2.9 million mt in 2014\\nIn the full year 2014, Indonesia imported 2.9 million mt of potash, a 29% increase on the previous year and the largest yearly imports since 2011, according to GTIS.\\nThe country imported 49% of the volumes, or 1.4 million mt, from Canpotex, which increased its yearly sales to Indonesia by roughly 70,000 mt. But Canpotex lost around 10% of its market share.\\nBPC more than doubled its sales volumes to 624,233 mt and Uralkali quadrupled its Indonesian sales to 574,711 mt.\\nAPC more than halved Indonesian sales to 170,285 mt and the country imported 95,033 mt from K+S.\\nIn December, Indonesia imported 257,599 mt of potash, more than double its December 2013 figures with in excess of 50% imported from Canpotex.\\nChina: APC signs new sales contract\\nJordanian producer Arab Potash Company has reached a deal with Sinochem Fertilizer Macao Commercial Offshore to supply 600,000 mt of potash to China in 2015.\\nThe figures are firm tonnage and the deal also includes optional quantities, which are not reported.\\nThe terms of the deal \"reflect the current market prices,\" according to APC, which is likely to mean that they were signed at $315/mt CFR.\\nBelarusian producer BPC recently negotiated a $10/mt increase on the previous $305/mt CFR Chinese contract, undercutting plans by Canpotex and Uralkali to achieve a larger increase.\\nBPC signed firm contracts for 1.7 million mt of potash and Canpotex for 1.8 million mt last week, with Uralkali and ICL likely to sign contracts this week.\\nThe APC deal demonstrates a partnership between APC and Sinochem Macao, which has existed since the early 1980s. In 2013, the two companies signed an agreement making Sinochem Macao the exclusive channel for all APC sales of MOP to China between 2014 and 2016.\\nSULPHUR\\nANALYSIS\\nGlobal sulphur sentiment soft as activity lacking\\nSentiment in global sulphur markets remained soft, with a lack of demand and further price declines expected.\\nAramco Trading is expected to confirm its May price next week, and market participants expect a dramatic decline from its April level of $165/mt FOB.\\nChinese domestic prices fell over the course of the week, and counters to international offers similarly plunged. Market activity was low, and most expect some further price declines over the coming weeks. The price falls have come despite persistently low port inventories, demonstrating a decoupling of the historical relationship between the two market indicators. Market participants disagree as to how far away the market floor price may be.\\nIndian demand was also lacking, with a range of phosphate players undergoing or soon to undergo maintenance and price ideas unchanged.\\nContract negotiations continued in different regions.\\nOn European Q2 sulphur contracts, buyers have been seeking price declines of $10-15/mt while sellers have been seeking price increases of $10-15/mt. Sources away from negotiations believe that a rollover is the most likely outcome.\\nContracts aimed at Q2 volumes to North Africa were not yet settled by either Russian or Middle Eastern sellers. Expectations range from a drop of $5/mt to one of more than $15/mt from the Q1 level of $160- 165/mt CFR. Recent spot business to Morocco has been conducted at $140-142/mt CFR from the Middle East and Mediterranean.\\nMeanwhile, full-year trade data showed that Moroccan imports climbed 18% or around 700,000 mt in 2015, with Russia, the US and Kuwait increasing their market share while Saudi Arabia and Spain saw their share decrease.\\nThe Vancouver FOB spot assessment was reduced based on notional netback levels, as previous FOB offer prices were far from anything that could be achieved in current spot markets anywhere in the world.\\nBrazilian spot prices were also assessed lower on market feedback, though the outcome of Anglo American’s recent tender was unclear.\\nOn the buy side, IJC issued a tender for 40,000 mt and Lafchemco issued a tender for 25,000 mt. On the sell side, Tasweeq issued its latest 35,000 mt tender.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Chinese prices fall further\\n∙Europe Q2 talks drag on\\n∙North African Q2 talks yet to conclude but decline expected\\n∙Moroccan 2014 imports up 700,000 mt\\n∙Vancouver FOB spot assessment reduced to $140-150/mt\\n∙IJC tenders for 40,000 mt for May import\\n∙Lafchemco tenders for 25,000 mt for May import\\n∙Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt export tender\\n\\n\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: Vancouver FOB levels assessed lower on notional netbacks but indications scarce\\nVancouver FOB prices were assessed considerably lower week on week based on international CFR prices, although firm indications could not be obtained.\\nOver recent weeks, it has been reported that sellers were not considering bids below $170/mt FOB. But with this FOB price above even CFR prices available in any region, it is clear that this would be an unrealistic expectation.\\nPending further confirmation of price levels, values have been assessed at an indicative $140-150/mt FOB Vancouver, though most believe that sellers would in fact have to offer below $140/mt FOB to move volumes given current prices elsewhere.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Prices inch down but market quiet\\nBrazilian prices were assessed lower this week at $160-165/mt CFR, as the upper end of the previous assessment was not reflective of market levels.\\nNo details could be obtained on Anglo American’s most recent tender for 37,000 mt, and market sources were not clear whether it had in fact been awarded.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nRussia: Q2 contracts yet to settle\\nRussian contracts for Q2 have yet to settle, although sources say that buyers and sellers are getting closer to an agreement.\\nSome market participants away from negotiations believe that a decline from Q1 settlements is likely, but sellers did not want to discuss possible price movements prior to settlement.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Contracts yet to settle\\nNo conclusion was yet reported on European sulphur contracts, as buyers and sellers differed in their view of the market situation.\\nBuyers have been seeking price declines of $10-15/mt based on weak demand and price falls elsewhere, while sellers have been seeking price increases of $10-15/mt based on tight availability resulting from a range of refinery turnarounds.\\nSources away from negotiations believe that a rollover is the most likely outcome.\\nMediterranean: Sulphur market stable\\nThe Mediterranean sulphur market was little changed on the week, and prices remained pegged at $135- 140/mt CFR.\\nSources reported that tight availability as a result of the Priolo maintenance has led to firm domestic demand in Italy.\\nEgyptian business was also reported in the $135-140/mt CFR range.\\nSources reported that container freight rates in the region were falling.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nQatar: Tasweeq issues latest 35,000 mt tender\\nTasweeq issued its latest export tender for 35,000 mt.\\nThe tender closes April 21.\\nMorocco: Contracts expected lower; spot in low $140s/mt CFR\\nNorth African sulphur contracts for Q2 have yet to settle, but a decrease from the Q2 levels of $160-165/mt CFR seems all but certain at this stage.\\nExpectations ranged from a drop of $5/mt to one of more than $15/mt.\\nRecent spot business to Morocco has been conducted at $140-142/mt CFR from the Middle East and Mediterranean.\\nSaudi Arabia: Aramco price expected next week\\nAramco Trading is expected to confirm its May price next week, and market participants expect a dramatic decline.\\nThe seller’s April price was $165/mt FOB, which is well above what is achievable on current CFR prices, and prices are expected to remain weak and likely decline further in coming weeks.\\nLast week, Tasweeq announced its QSP for April at $145/mt FOB, down $19/mt from March, and Adnoc announced its OSP for April at $140/mt FOB, representing a $35/mt fall.\\nJordan: IJC tenders for 40,000 mt\\nIJC issued a tender for 40,000 mt for arrival at Aqaba May 15-20.\\nThe tender closes on 13 April.\\nMorocco: Sulphur imports up 38% in 2014\\nMorocco’s 2014 sulphur imports were up 18% on the previous year at 4.5 million mt as December imports climbed 38% year on year to 393,622 mt.\\nRussia supplied 1.92 million mt of the 2014 tonnes, with its market share climbing to 42.6% from 38.65%.\\nOther key sources of imports were the UAE, which supplied 842,637 mt, Poland, which supplied 404,623 mt, and the US, which supplied 330,586 mt. The US volume was up from 183,543 mt in 2013, with its share increasing to 7.34% from 4.82%. Spain saw its share decrease to 4.32% from 5.81% as it supplied 194,577 mt in 2014.\\nSaudi Arabia’s share also declined to 6.42% from 8.89% as Morocco’s imports from the country decreased to 289,070 mt from 338,539 mt. Imports from Kuwait almost tripled to 156,164 mt from 54,517 mt.\\nIn 2015, Moroccan sulphur demand is expected to decrease slightly as OCP refocuses operations towards the production of NPKs for the African market.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Prices unchanged but activity lacking\\nPrice ideas for sulphur in India remained in the $160s/mt CFR, with no new spot business reported.\\nTurnarounds at buyers have left them under less pressure to buy. IFFCO and CIL have both begun maintenances that will run until mid-to-late April, and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20.\\nRCF’s 5,000 mt, which was extended to March 10 from March 4, was awarded to Managlore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited at INR 10,240/mt EXW.\\n\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 79\\nIndia: January sulphur imports inch up\\nIndia\\'s January imports of sulphur increased 3% year on year to 152,561 mt.\\nMost of the tonnes came from the Middle East, with 55,424 mt from Saudi Arabia, 53,830 mt from Qatar, 16,587 mt from Bahrain, and 13,200 mt from the UAE.\\nIn addition, Japan supplied 12,032 mt.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nVietnam: Lafchemco tenders for 25,000 mt\\nLafchemco issued a tender for 25,000 mt sulphur shipment up to early May.\\nThe tender closes April 14.\\nCurrent price ideas to Vietnam are in the low-to-mid-$160s/mt CFR.\\nChina: Domestic prices fall further despite low port inventories\\nPrices in the domestic Chinese market dropped further as spot activity remained limited.\\nQuotes in Eastern China for granular product were around RMB 1,180/mt FCA at ports. Although quotes at Fangcheng were relatively high at RMB 1,240-1,260/mt FCA, there was not much interest from buyers at these prices.\\nThe price falls have continued despite continuing low levels of port inventories, which were around 0.95 million mt.\\nCurrently, the fertilizer industry is the only sector with strong demand, while other sectors including fluoric acid and caprolactam offered limited demand as their production rates were low.\\nSome regions, particularly Hubei, also struggled with strong competition from smelter acid, which offered prices that were low and negotiable.\\nSulphur future contracts on the commodity exchange in Jiangsu have May prices at RMB 1,150/mt FCA.\\nImport prices have not been falling as rapidly as domestic port prices over the past week. The discussed range was $150-160/mt CFR, but no spot deals were confirmed in this range, and some sources said that achievable prices were more likely in the $140s/mt CFR.\\nHowever, large phosphate producers have reportedly been buying large quantities of imported product, and it is believed that they are paying prices close to the equivalents of FOB levels quoted by major international producers.\\nPrices for molten product were no longer well below those of granular sulphur, as their prices have not fallen as much.\\nHowever, crushed lump deals were confirmed at $130-135/mt CFR.\\nSinopec’s Puguang had around 18,000 mt at Wenzhou, but as its price of RMB 1,200/mt FCA was no longer below prices available from other sellers, its business was slower. Its stock at plant was around 80,000 mt, with prices RMB 1,100/mt EXW, further demonstrating slow consumption.\\nAlthough phosphate producers can afford current sulphur prices, it suits them to see further price declines. Some turnarounds at large phosphate producers are planned for April and May, which may also hurt sulphur demand, although traders believe that where possible the companies will shorten or delay turnarounds to take advantage of phosphate export demand.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nANALYSIS\\nSulphuric acid prices stable with little new business\\nSulphuric acid prices remained stable across the globe this week, as there was little new spot activity reported.\\nIn Europe, the FOB spot assessment was unchanged. Market players awaited the conclusion of a 15,000 mt enquiry from Petrobras, while the previously reported 36,000 mt enquiry from Yara was believed to be a market testing exercise that has not so far resulted in any firm business.\\nOther spot demand for European product was limited; as Moroccan spot demand remained slow given weaker sulphur prices and somewhat lower acid requirements, and it is expected that the country will not be as strong a source of demand as it has been in recent months, though it is expected to continue importing large volumes. Full-year trade data showed that Moroccan imports had climbed by two thirds from 2013, with more than 70% of this volume from Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium.\\nUS February imports climbed 13% on the year, with high volumes from European exporters.\\nEuropean contracts for Q2 were mostly settled at a rollover from Q1, in line with expectations.\\nIn Asia, the FOB spot assessment was also unchanged, with no new business reported.\\nIndian demand remains a key source of market support, but sources wondered how sustainable the demand is, particularly given a range of phosphate plant turnarounds and the expectation of somewhat lower prices in coming months when Asian smelter turnarounds conclude.\\nChilean spot demand also remains lacklustre, and some fear that recent floods may have dented hopes for a resurgence. Trade data showed that Chile’s February exports were up 20% year on year, with recently- reported Mexican sales to the country showing up in the figures. Meanwhile, Patache port is now closed to sulphuric acid though still open to sulphur. Buyers in the northern region of the country will therefore be facing an increase of around $60/mt on their freight costs for imported acid, as they will have to move product from Mejillones.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Petrobras seeking 15,000 mt for import\\n∙Global FOB assessments stable\\n∙Moroccan imports up by two thirds in 2014\\n∙European Q2 contracts settle unchanged\\n∙US February imports climb with strong European volumes\\n∙Chilean February imports up 20%\\n∙Patache close to sulphuric acid bringing up northern Chile import prices\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals again showed slight gains over the week, although movements were mixed. Uncertainty over possible rate increases by the Fed led to a weaker dollar, providing some support to commodity prices. LME copper was up to $6,050/mt for cash.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nUS Gulf sulphuric acid pricing likely will be affected by any Q2 liquid sulphur settlement between US Gulf phosphate producers Mosaic and PotashCorp and their suppliers in coming weeks, but so far there is precious little chatter about the state of those negotiations. The falling price of DAP in the US in theory could lead to lower output from the aforementioned phosphate producers, which in turn might lead them to market some of their own sulphuric acid, but this is only speculation at this stage.\\nGlobal market sentiment for sulphur remained soft, with most expecting further price falls over coming weeks. Market activity was limited with little demand in any region to offer support. The expected announcement of Aramco\\'s May price next week is eagerly awaited by market watchers, with a large drop expected from its April level.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices inched up further this week, continuing their recent recovery and reaching $1,670- 1,700/mt CFR China. Prices may gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nCanada: February sulphuric acid exports decline 16.6%\\nCanada\\'s February exports of sulphuric acid declined 16.6% year on year to 140,148 mt.\\nAs is typical, effectively all of the exports went to the US.\\n\\nUS: February imports climb as European volumes high\\nUS imports of sulphuric acid for February were up 13% year on year to 275,985 mt.\\nCanada was the source of the majority of February tonnes, supplying 140,126 mt. This was followed by Mexico, which supplied 56,143 mt.\\nEuropean countries were the source of more acid imports than usual, with 24,038 mt from Germany, 19,315 mt from Finland, 18,927 mt from Sweden, and 17,001 mt from Poland.\\nThis marks the highest monthly volume from Germany since June 2011, from Finland since June 2009, and from Poland since April 2014.\\n\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Petrobras seeking 15,000 mt\\nPetrobras is seeking 15,000 mt of sulphur, though a deal had not yet been concluded by press time.\\nMeanwhile, Yara’s requirement for two lots of 18,000 mt led to some confusion, as many in the market believed that the buyer was merely testing the market and it was not a firm enquiry.\\nOpinion was split as to whether Brazilian prices will climb into the $90s/mt CFR or remain in the $80s/mt CFR.\\nChile: February imports climb 20%; Patache closed to acid\\nChile’s sulphuric acid imports for February climbed 20% year on year to 236,120 mt, their highest monthly volume since April 2014.\\nPeru supplied 106,994 mt of the February volumes, with 50,564 mt from Japan, 36,720 mt from Mexico, 22,502 mt from South Korea, and 19,135 mt from Spain.\\nThe Mexican tonnes represent the largest volume imported from the country by Chile since October 2011.\\nAs recently reported, Mexico has become a surprising source of marginal supply; with product from both the Boleo mine and Grupo Mexico satisfying Latin American demand. By mid-March this year, Boleo had reportedly sold four parcels of around 19,000 mt each, with three to Chile and one to Brazil.\\nMeanwhile, Patache port is now closed to sulphuric acid though still open to sulphur. Buyers in the northern region of the country will therefore be facing an increase of around $60/mt on their freight costs for imported acid, as they will have to move product from Mejillones.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Spot assessment unchanged as new business awaited\\nEuropean spot export prices were assessed unchanged at $27-35/mt FOB Northwest Europe as most market participants agreed with the range and there was no new business to suggest that FOB levels had changed.\\nHowever, some sources argued that the current market tightness would mean that higher prices would be more representative of what would be achievable, with prices as high as $40/mt FOB suggested.\\nEurope: Q2 contracts mostly settled at rollovers\\nEuropean contracts for sulphuric acid are mostly settled, with the majority of contracts a rollover from Q1 levels.\\nSome small increases were achieved on truck contracts, but bulk contracts were mostly unchanged.\\nThis was in line with expectations.\\nThe assessed range therefore remains €57-80/mt CFR Northwest Europe.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: Sulphuric acid spot activity lacking\\nNo new spot business to Morocco has been reported recently.\\nTraders say that OCP has enquired after product, but has not found current spot price ideas into the $60s/mt CFR sufficiently attractive, as it is receiving contract volumes at prices well below this and is also benefitting from falling sulphur prices.\\nThe buyer has indicated that it will have a much lower spot acid requirement over the coming months, as its new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP\\'s other facilities.\\nMorocco: Sulphuric acid imports jump 66% in 2014\\nMorocco\\'s imports of sulphuric acid in 2014 climbed 66% from the previous year to 889,809 mt, trade data show, as December imports climbed 48% year on year to 63,947 mt.\\nHowever, the breakdown suggests that December imports were exactly the same volume as in November from India (21,918 mt), Belgium (15,043 mt), and Italy (8,198 mt), though the figure for imports from Spain climbed to 18,785 mt from 15,749 mt.\\nOver the course of 2014, Spain was the largest source of Morocco’s sulphuric acid imports, supplying 36%, while Bulgaria supplied 26% and Belgium 10%.\\nMorocco has continued to be an important source of demand so far this year, but it is likely to reduce its sulphuric acid market activity in the coming months. OCP’s new 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is expected to be brought onstream in April. While the company’s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus sulphuric acid available for use in OCP’s other facilities.\\n\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Price ideas unchanged but activity limited\\nIndian prices remained pegged in the $70s/mt CFR, but no new business was confirmed and market participants questioned whether current Indian spot demand for sulphuric acid was sustainable.\\nSources reported that Indian buyers continue to enquire after product, but no spot import deals were reported.\\nDomestic SSP players are buying acid in the range of INR 4,000-5,000/mt ($65-80/mt) from domestic suppliers.\\nDemand from P&K; players is likely to be low as turnarounds at buyers leave them under less pressure to buy. IFFCO and CIL have both begun maintenances that will run until mid-to-late April, and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSoutheast Asia: Spot demand limited to small volumes\\nSoutheast Asian spot demand remains predominantly for small lots of 3,000-4,000 mt, according to market sources.\\nIt is therefore of minimal interest to traders, and is unlikely to boost market spot prices from their current level.\\nJapan/South Korea: FOB prices stable but availability tight\\nEast Asian FOB prices remained assessed at $17-22/mt FOB Japan/South Korea.\\nNo new firm price indications were reported, and most market participants believed that the current assessment was reflective of market levels.\\nBut tight availability meant that those with prompt requirements might need to source more expensive sulphur-burnt product from elsewhere, as has happened in recent weeks.\\nIndeed, recent spot business from China to India at close to $80/mt CFR indicates that much higher netbacks could be achievable on East Asian acid.\\nPhilippines: PASAR yet to begin maintenance\\nGlencore’s PASAR smelter has not yet started its maintenance, sources said.\\nIt is still expected to undergo a turnaround for much of Q2 in order integrate a capacity expansion.\\nChina: Sulphuric acid prices stable\\nSulphuric acid prices in China were relatively stable despite falls in sulphur.\\nSulphur burners are still struggling to compete with smelter acid, despite lower sulphur prices. But they, and pyrite-based producers, have been helped by revenue from sales of steam created during the production process.\\nHowever, in Hubei province sources reported that prices for steam had dropped to RMB 50-70/mt, making it more difficult for sulphur- and pyrite-based producers to compete with smelters.\\nMeanwhile, demand from non-fertilizer sectors remains weak, as industrial buyers are running at low rates.\\nDemand for imported sulphuric acid was therefore also relatively low, with buyers not providing the same level of support to the spot market that they did in previous years, though they continue to take high import volumes from South Korean smelters.\\nNPKS\\nMARKETS\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: Weak levels of NPK activity\\nNPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months, with only small deals being made despite being deep into normal spring buying season.\\nWeak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers\\' buying side have all impacted NPK demand and even the reduced prices are failing to attract buyers.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively.

The low offers that were used by STC to counter suppliers did not spark significant selling interest from sources outside Iran.\\nChinese producers with costs at the low end of the curve will undoubtedly have been interested in pursuing part of the business, but the call by the Chinese Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association not to accept bids into the low $250s/mt FOB appears to have sidelined the vast majority of Chinese producers.\\nTraditional Middle East suppliers have also opted not to book any tonnage via traders with STC, and have concentrated on disposing tonnage via existing contracts and spot sales to other destinations instead.\\nThe strategy has so far paid off via sales to Latin America at returns above $260/mt FOB, and the producers are also enjoying improved netbacks from the US market. Trades in granular urea barges were flat to higher this week, as that market is out of range to new supply at this stage for the spring season. The only\\nexception to this would be shipments from the Caribbean, but much of that production is being taken offline temporarily by PotashCorp. The company has idled its Trinidad and Tobago urea unit in favor of ammonia sales, which yield better margins at this time.\\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed reports indicate that extended rain in Louisiana in recent weeks and months has slowed work on CF\\'s planned urea expansion. That plant likely will begin commercial operations in August rather than July, as previously indicated.\\nWhile Mexican and Central American importers have paid up to secure granular urea for April and May, Brazilian importers appear content with purchases to date, and are yet to get on the band-waggon for significant price increases. A purchase this week was up by a mere $3/mt on last week\\'s low end. Traders\\' perceptions on forward values in Brazil in paper markets are entirely different. Firm April 16 bids for May positions at FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $270/mt CFR were countered with offers at $273/mt CFR. Postings for April were at $262-268/mt CFR, but these obviously do take into account the Index numbers of the prior April weeks.\\nThe limited success by STC to secure substantial quantities to date has influenced traders\\' perceptions of the market, and the April 10 session will likely be followed by an early May tender to procure additional tonnage on top of the STC volume.\\nOpinions on pricing in a follow-up tender differ widely, but higher CFR values appear necessary to trigger widespread acceptance by suppliers other than Iran. Traders having shorted the market at low numbers argue that the flip side of that coin is the need for China to dispose of inventories.\\nSome movement of port inventories back into the domestic market in China is however already evident, suggesting that some producers feel more comfortable building stock for the domestic market that they would be in facing the low bids currently available. Bearish observers write the movement off as a short-term strategy designed to convince buyers that availability is not as abundant as it is in reality.\\nIn the Black Sea, the market has remained relatively stable, and the combination of traders covering prior short sales and prospects of 150,000 mt to be shipped to Egypt by the end of July continued to stem the slide in prices. Baltic values for prilled and granular urea remain under pressure, but the boosted values for granular urea into Latin America will provide some support to prilled prices in the region.\\nHighlights of the week\\n∙A slow week despite the STC tender\\n∙Offers to STC in April 10 tender abundant in $270s/mt CFR\\n∙But quotes in $260s/mt CFR fail to attract significant selling interest\\n∙US granular values rebounded somewhat, demand outpacing supply chain to interior\\n∙Middle East netbacks move above $260/mt FOB in sales to Mexico and C. America\\n∙Brazilian granular values improve marginally, but still far behind other markets\\n∙Egyptian April 18 tender for 150,000 mt prills eagerly awaited by FSU suppliers\\n∙Pakistan urea tender not yet in sight\\n∙Netbacks on European granular still below $280s/mt FOB from Egypt\\n∙Qafco III, V and VI running well\\n∙Safco V commercial urea output maintained for mid-May\\nShort term outlook\\nMixed, but the floor suggested in prior weeks was found for Middle East granular, albeit conceivably temporary. Forward short-term values will largely depend on US barge prices and on European willingness to cover summer and fall requirements at prevailing prices rather than sit back, hoping for further discounts over the slow summer months.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nMexico: Tepeyac books Middle East granular\\nWhile not confirmed by the traders, CHS and Ameropa were widely associated with sales of full cargos of Middle East granular urea to Mexico this week. Tepeyac booked one cargo around $288/mt CFR Manzanillo. Isaosa was negotiating a similar sized lot, but confirmation that a deal had been closed was not available at press time.\\nUS Southern Plains: Granular urea rebounds as weather finally supports field work\\nTruck values moved up about $5/st from last week\\'s lows thanks to seasonal demand finally getting underway with vigor across most of the region, after weeks of delay due to wet weather. Current postings are $325-335/st FOB along the Arkansas River and in Texas, with strong demand for corn, silage crops, rice and cotton across the south.\\nUS Midwest: Granular urea movement spikes as corn planting underway\\nGranular urea is moving fast from Midwest warehouses, with most of the activity reported from northern and western positions as corn planting gets underway. The surge in demand was sufficient to pull Midwest prices up $5-10/st this week, with a range of $330-340/st FOB covering most of the week\\'s business. Distributors are borrowing tons from each other to meet not only spot demand but also pre-paid sales that have yet to be backed by deliveries from suppliers out of the US Gulf. Not only have weather conditions delayed barge movement, but domestic traders noted too many players waited too long to buy into the market to cover earlier sales. Many believed US prices had not stopped their long fall that began in Q1.\\nUS NOLA: Odd spread emerges in New Orleans values\\nDespite early sales of granular urea near to $280/st FOB New Orleans, and as much as $310/st FOB paid for barges positioned along the upper Mississippi River, some cheap sales still occured. The low end of the week\\'s range was $261/st FOB New Orleans paid for a non-Chinese barge.\\nRegardless of the lower-priced business, many traders expect to see another couple of weeks of firm prices ahead. Despite this view, forward offers for May are widely available at $270/st FOB for barges in the Gulf.\\nPrilled urea is oversupplied in the US Gulf, with material originating from the FSU, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Qatar on offer as low as $260/st FOB.\\nUS Northern Plains: Wider spread emerges\\nA wider than expected spread has emerged in the Northern Plains market, with buyers in the Dakotas finding some spot tons priced based on more recent replacement costs out of the US Gulf.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nTrinidad and Tobago: Sharply lower urea values lead PotashCorp to cut output\\nPotashCorp has idled its granular urea unit, the only such plant in Trinidad and Tobago, starting this month in favor of selling more ammonia into the export market. The driver behind the decision is the plunging value of urea versus ammonia globally. Returns on new urea sales to some of Trinidad\\'s key markets in North and South America arguably would be as little as $240/mt FOB, given values in those markets.\\nThe move also coincides with reduced gas availability in Trinidad and Tobago for all nitrogen producers due to the ongoing work to improve logistics and bring new offshore gas platforms on line. The National Gas Co. has indicated an 11-day curtailment at about a 15% rate starting this week, but indications from the gas distributor historically have been optimistic. Therefore, sources at PotashCorp were not willing to predict how long the urea unit would be down.\\nBrazil: Paper values for granular urea up, but physical market yet to follow\\nBids for CFR Brazil granular urea positions on FIS Cash Settled Swaps at $273/mt CFR for May were up by $11/mt on bids posted April 14, but importers of physical tonnage had yet to adjust bids accordingly.\\nOne part-cargo off an inbound carrier traded this week at $263/mt CFR. The stronger sentiment in Middle East urea nevertheless appears set to necessitate significant upward moves on the part of importers to be able to access additional tons from traders and producers. Offers from traders were no lower than $280/mt CFR at press time.\\nPeru: Ameropa set to ship from China\\nAmeropa has been in the freight market for a vessel to load a combination of prilled and granular urea for a total quantity of 30,000 mt to five ports Peru against its prior sale. The trader was seeking a vessel to arrive Yantai/China by April 20 for loading.\\nCentral America: EuroChem books Incofe tender and CHS books Mayafert\\nThe April 10 Incofe tender for 20,000 mt prilled urea and 5,000 mt granular urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN was awarded to EuroChem for all products that are to be loaded by May 15. The prilled urea wil be shipped to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala while the granular urea will load for Limon/Costa Rica.\\nThe 10,000 mt AN will be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt). Mayafert was linked to a purchase of a full cargo of granular urea of Middle East origin from CHS. Exact details on pricing in the transactions have not been released.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBlack Sea: Trading still subdued and prilled urea prices flat\\nThe recent boost to Middle East granular values has yet to positively impact prilled urea values in the Black Sea, and producers have so far maintained targets around $260/mt FOB for late April and May. Sales are however also suggested down to $255/mt FOB, and the price-point has been posted accordingly.\\nIt is uncertain whether OPZ will begin selling some of its urea via electronic auctions late April as has been widely reported, but the Interbank Currency Exchange statement issued last week left little room for doubt that this will actually occur.\\nSuppliers are meanwhile concentrating on executing open business where shipments and firm nominations from Yuzhnyy are now above 90.000 mt for April with the addition of the T. Bayaraktar with 5,000 mt for Mekatrade to the list below:\\n\\n(1)cargo from TIS - DneproAzot\\n(2)incl. 20,000mt from TIS - DneproAzot\\nBaltic Sea/Belarus: GrodnoAzot to tender April 17\\nGrodnoAzot has floated a tender for the sale of 25,000 mt each granular and prilled urea to load from the plants late April/early May. The session is set to close April 17.\\nEUROPE\\nUK: Urea imports through February up substantially\\nImports of urea by the UK in February of 67,000 mt as identified by GTIS were up by 1.5% on the prior year. Russia accounted for 19,000 mt, up by 228% and Algeria supplied 14,000 mt, up from zero.\\nThe January-February volume of 180,000 mt was up by a significant 36.7%. Arrivals from Netherlands accounted for 34,000 mt, up by 38% on the prior year and deliveries from Russia of 33,000 mt were up by 63%. Egyptian shipments of 27,000 mt were up by 5.3%. Qatar, Algeria and China leaped from zero to 24,000 mt, 21,000 mt and 6,000 mt, respectively.\\nRomania: Slow market but stable netbacks\\nNo new sales of prilled urea have been reported this week, but low offers into Turkey for dutiable FSU tonnage reflected netbacks around $253/mt FOB for FSU material, for a $270/mt FOB Romania equivalent. The FOB price-point has been maintained accordingly.\\nRomanian exports of urea in January as identified by GTIS were a mere 14,500 mt, down by 58% on the prior year. Exports to Serbia of 8,300 mt were up from zero while Turkey accounted for about 2,900 mt, down by 13.6%. Calendar 2014 exports of 468,000 mt were down by 6.2% on 2013.\\nNetherlands: Urea imports and exports in January down year-on-year\\nImports of urea by the Netherlands in January identified by GTIS of a mere 4,600 mt were down by a full 90.6% on the quantity imported in January 2014. The drop followed imports of 153,000 mt in calendar 2014, up by 14.4% on 2013.\\nJanuary urea exports of 36,500 mt were down by 67.1% on January 2014. Exports to the US of 18,500 mt were up by 745.4% on the prior year. The 2014 total exports of 1.58 million mt was up by 31.1% on the calendar 2013 volume.\\nGermany: January urea imports up marginally while exports drop 10%\\nImports of urea by Germany identified by Eurostat via GTIS of 110,000 mt in January were up by 1.1% on last year. Russia accounted for 52,600 mt of the total, followed by Algeria with 12,400 mt and by Poland and the Netherlands with about 12,000 mt each. The minor January increase followed 2014 imports of 696,000 mt that were up by 8% on the prior year.\\nGerman urea exports in January of 74,000 mt were down by 10.4% on the prior year. Exports to Canada were flat year on year at 11,000 mt while deliveries to the UK of 8,600 mt were down by 36%. Poland and France accounted for about 7,400 mt each. Total 2014 exports from Germany of 951,000 mt were up by 2.75% on the 2013 volume.\\nSpain: New sales marginally below last week\\nAs in the case of France, granular urea values in Spain are flat to soft. One sale into a Spanish Mediterranean port was concluded this week at $302/mt CFR, duty paid, presumably with 90 days credit, down marginally on sales last week.\\nSpanish urea imports in January identified by GTIS of 92,000 mt were down by 43% on January 2014. Arrivals from Algeria of 29,000 mt were up by 135% and deliveries from China were up from zero to 16,000 mt. China accounted for 16,000 mt, up from zero, and Iranian deliveries went from zero to 14,000 mt. Supplies from Egypt of 7,000 mt were down by 50% on the prior year.\\nFrance: Granular volatility yet to impact local prices\\nThe latest uptick in granular urea values in the Middle East have yet to trigger significant spot purchasing activity in the French Bay and in Mediterranean ports. Sales for early May delivery have been concluded this week at $303-308/mt CFR French Mediterranean ports, duty paid. The $308/mt CFR reflects around an even €300/mt FCA at the current €/$1.071 exchange rate, but spot sales are still reported for small quantities from warehouses in the French Bay at €305-310/mt FCA. Offers for summer-fill and forward positions are suggested below €290/mt FCA in the Bay.\\nFebruary imports of urea into France identified by GTIS of 131,200 mt were up by almost 22% on February 2014. Algeria accounted for 24,000 mt, up by 63% while deliveries of 23,000 mt from Russia were down by 27%. The January-February total of 243,000 mt was nevertheless off by 12.6% on the prior year. Algerian deliveries of 55,000 mt were up by 55% while shipments from Egypt of 42,000 mt were down by 17%. Russian arrivals of 41,000 mt were down by 30%.\\nTurkey: Buyers talking but no new sales\\nActivity in urea has slowed in recent days following the purchase by Gemlik of the PIC/GPIC cargo of granular via Ameropa. A major buyer is in discussions with suppliers for a parcel of 6-8,000 mt for April or early May loading for Samsun, but no purchase had been concluded at press time. An initial low offer was suggested below $275/mt CFR duty unpaid including 180 days credit, indicative of producer netbacks around $255/mt FOB at sight if shipped from the Black Sea.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Physical and paper-values for granular urea rebound\\nThe market for granular urea inched higher in recent trades in the physical market and in paper-markets. A cargo of SIUCI granular reportedly traded in the low $260s/mt FOB to Keytrade, up by more than $14/mt on netbacks from prior Brazilian sales, and also up on last week\\'s assessed netbacks from the US barge- market. Two further cargos for late April loading was suggested sold by Fertil at similar numbers, reportedly purchased by CHS and intended for Latin America.\\nPaper markets also went up significantly. Firm offers posted on FIS Cash Settled Swaps April 16 for May positions at $265/mt FOB were countered with bids at $260/mt FOB. The average was up by $10/mt on quotes posted earlier in the week. The April 16 bid-offer range for June was up to $258-263/mt FOB and the spread for July at $257-260/mt FOB.\\nIn prior deals, Trammo is in the freight market for 36-38,500 mt PIC granular urea to load from Sitra or Shuaiba for Paranagua and Aratu/Brazil in April 23-25 laydays.\\nNetbacks from contract markets such as Thailand are still below $2560/mt FOB, but returns on US contract cargos priced via formula are up this week as reflected in the price-point assessed at $265-273/mt FOB.\\nIran: Pardis suggests relatively high netbacks in April 14 sales tender\\nIranian producer Pardis Petrochemical Co. is indicating netbacks well above $255/mt FOB were secured in sales of around 250,000 mt urea to traders intending to dispose of the material to STC in India in the April 14 sales session for the tonnage to load in April and May.\\nAhead of the PPC tender, indications from Iranian producers were marginally below $255/mt FOB, permitting traders to generate a small margin basis counters from STC at $268.50/mt CFR Mundra and $269.22/mt CFR Kandla. Freight for a large carrier to Mundra is assessed around $9/mt plus transaction costs. A provision for added interest will also need to be added due to the reimbursement clause incorporated in\\nthe tender that allows STC to effect payment on receipt of funding from the DoF.\\nIran: Q1 urea exports exceed 500,000 mt\\nExports of urea from Iran registered by customs via GTIS in March 2015 of 184,000 mt were up sharply on the 21,400 mt exported in March 2014. The main destination was India which absorbed 75,000 mt, followed by Italy with 55,000 mt, Brazil with 27,000 mt and Afghanistan with 15,000 mt.\\nThe March volume brought Q1 exports to 503,000 mt, up by 210% on Q1 2014. Brazil was in the lead with 143,000 mt, up from zero in Q1 2014. India followed with 131,000 mt, up by 53% on the prior year. Deliveries to Iraq of 66,000 mt were up by 75% and shipments to Italy of 55,000 mt were up from zero in Q1 2014. Belgium and France accounted for about 33,000 mt each:\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 21\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: STC issues urea awards, but quantity stuck at 360,000 mt\\nLatest reports from Delhi confirm that STC secured acceptance for 360,000 mt urea so far. One cargo of 60,000 mt will have been booked by MTPL per their low offer for Krishnapatnam at $266/mt CFR and Global will have booked the 60,000 mt for Mundra at its $268.50/mt CFR offer plus 60,000 mt at the\\noffered $269.22/mt CFR Pipavav. Pricing for those three lots were the basis for the counters from STC, and thus entailed a simple acceptance on the part of the importer to secure the quantities.

MTPL offered lowest at $266/mt CFR for 360,000 mt firm, followed by Agri Commodities at $267.20/mt CFR for 125,000 mt firm. Global offered at $268.50/mt CFR for 150,000 mt firm.\\nOffers from Amber, Aries, Ameropa, Dreymoor, Fertisul, Mekatrade, Quantum, Sinochem and Keytrade were disqualified.\\nA total 2.8 million mt was offered firm and 625,000 mt option, but only the tender-conform offers are listed in the following:\\n\\ns/o =at seller’s option Apt= As per tender\\nM=Mundra, K=Kandla, Kp= Krishnapatnam, V=Vizag, Kk=Kakinada,\\nGv =Gangavaram, Kr=Karaikal, Pi= Pipavav\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Small import deals still at low numbers\\nThe small tenders last week by Namhae and Chobi were reportedly booked in the upper $270s/mt CFR, still reflecting trader-beliefs of further deterioration in Chinese export values despite the Chinese Nitrogen Association\\'s intervention pursuant to the low offers presented in the April 10 STC tender in India.\\nSouth Korean urea imports in March as identified by GTIS meanwhile jumped to 97,000 mt, up by 67% on the prior year. The entire quantity was imported from China. The March volume brought the total Q1 quantity to 234,000 mt, up by 23.4% on Q1 2014. China accounted for 229,000 mt of the total, an increase of 108% on the prior year.\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 26\\nChina: CNIFA pressure to block low priced urea sales to STC mounts\\nThe China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association continues to apply significant pressure on producers not to succumb to traders\\' calls for cover in the low to mid $250s/mt FOB for prilled urea. That level is assessed necessary for the traders to generate a margin on possible Indian sales basis the STC counter-bids at $266- 270.22/mt CFR pursuant to the Indian importer\\'s April 10 tender. The efforts appear to have been successful to date.\\nMainstream offers for prills for export are meanwhile being maintained by producers around the $265/mt FOB marker, but quotes for small parcels were also available at an even $260/mt FOB.\\nAs was the case last week, prices have been slipping further in the domestic market this week, but the netbacks to producers for prilled and granular urea are still significantly above those perceived in export deals. Mainstream offers in Shandong and the western part of Henan were down by about $8/mt equivalent to RMB 1,480-1,500/mt ($238-242/mt) EXW. The low end reflected an export value for the prills in the upper $270s/mt FOB.\\nLower trades were reported in Ordos, Inner Mongolia where a producer conceded sales down to RMB 1,360/mt EXW, but the higher inland transportation costs rendered the export value of those trades largely in line with the numbers calculated for material originating from Shandong and Henan.\\nTo compare, the counters from STC at the $266/mt CFR base price for fast East Coast India ports are estimated to provide producers with netbacks around $252/mt FOB after allowing for freight around $9/mt, direct transaction costs of $2/mt plus extra financing related to the revised STC payment/reimbursement clause that will delay payment, and a limited margin to an intermediary.\\nApplying inland transportation charges at an average of RMB 120/mt and throughput charges at key ports such as Yantai around RMB 75/mt, the $252/mt FOB would yield a producer a netback around an even RMB 1,300/mt EXW, at best.\\nA domestic/export value-spread was also evident in granular urea where repeat domestic deals were suggested at RMB 1,550-1,570/mt ($250-253/mt) FCA in Shanxi. These reflected export values for granular above $290/mt FOB. Offers for the premium grade for export are nevertheless still cited around $275/mt FOB.\\nInventories are assessed in line with last week, with about 900,000 mt combined of prilled and granular urea available for prompt shipment from key ports.\\nNITRATES & SULPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nQuiet week across nitrates with little price movement\\nUAN\\nTrade in UAN was reported fairly slow this week. In France few new prompt UAN-30 sales were fixed at €228-230/mt FCA owing to limited demand as farmers use up existing stocks.\\nAbu Qir will try again to sell 25,000 mt UAN-32 as it closes a new tender April 21 for prompt loading. This follows a sale of just 4,000 to Ameropa marginally below $210/mt FOB last week. The supplier is likely to encounter similar difficulties in selling this latest cargo given most buyers have previously secured tonnes required for the current application season in Europe. Potential sales to the US also would require a lower price tag given recent offers around $255/mt CFR and bids below $250/mt CFR for the Atlantic Coast.\\nAmmonium Sulphate\\nThe AS market is lacklustre owing to an industry conference taking place in Beijing, China this week. Chinese suppliers continue to seek values of $128-129/mt FOB for caprolactam grade product.\\nGrodnoAzot issued an export tender for 25,000 mt AS closing April 17 for April/May shipment. The supplier is targeting sales higher than $150/mt FOB.\\nAmmonium Nitrate/CAN\\nFurther substantial reductions in netbacks to FSU suppliers of AN did materialize as expected via activity in Latin America over recent days, and producers are now faced with bids no higher than $215/m t FOB for residual business.\\nThe US AN market remains disappointing, with too much supply being offered in a market that appears to have lower demand compared to prior years.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS New Orleans: AN barge supply still exceeds demand\\nThe surge in spring fertilizer applications inland has provided more guidance to the marketplace about potential ammonium nitrate demand, and so far the anecdotal reports are not positive for suppliers. Indications this week were that AN barges could be purchased at $290-295/st FOB New Orleans, down $5-\\n10/st from prior weeks. While demand is marginally reduced in the domestic market, according to distributors, most traders point to oversupply as the culprit for declining values.\\nUS Atlantic Coast: Quotes for UAN under more pressure\\nPart cargos of UAN-32 have sold at $258/mt CFR in recent days and offers from importers are down to\\n$255/mt CFR. Meanwhile, potential buyers\\' bids are below $250/mt CFR. While demand for UAN likely will meet prior expectations, buyers from the farm level all the way through to producers and importers expect values to fall substantially due to the same bearish price concerns for crops that have hurt other fertilizer prices.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nRussia: AN netbacks dip below $220/mt FOB\\nThe April 10 Incofe tender for 10,000 mt AN that was awarded to EuroChem is estimated to have been booked by the producer at a netback below $220/mt FOB from the Baltic. The Baltic and Black Sea Price- points have been adjusted accordingly. The cargo will ship in combination with urea to Colombia, Honduras and Costa Rica.\\nBrazil: AS imports steady for March\\nBrazilian AS imports for March 2015 reached 171,484 mt, virtually unchanged from the previous year, according to ANDA data.\\nIn the first two months of this year demand for AS grew substantially in line with a satisfactory outlook for the Safrinha crop and growing overall demand for the fertilizer.\\nAS prices have changed little over recent months and are currently pegged around $160/mt CFR for caprolactam grade product. Brazilian enquiries for AS are expected to increase from May for the summer application season:\\nwww.crugroup.comWeekly Overview Report | 29\\nCentral America: EuroChem books Incofe tender and CHS books Mayafert\\nThe April 10 Incofe tender for 20,000 mt prilled urea and 5,000 mt granular urea in combination with 10,000 mt AN was awarded to EuroChem for all products that are to be loaded by May 15. The prilled urea wil be shipped to Cortes/Honduras (15,000 mt) and Santo Tomas/Guatemala while the granular urea will load for Limon/Costa Rica.\\nThe 10,000 mt AN will be split between Cortes (6,000 mt) and Santo Tomas (4,000 mt). Mayafert was linked to a purchase of a full cargo of granular urea of Middle East origin from CHS. Exact details on pricing in the transactions have not been released.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBelarus: GrodnoAzot issues another AS tender\\nGrodnoAzot said it issued an export tender for 25,000 mt AS closing April 17 for April/May shipment. The supplier is targeting sales higher than $150/mt FOB.\\nIts previous tender for the same quantity closed on March 24. The volumes were eventually sold to neighbouring markets and domestic customers.\\nEUROPE\\nTurkey: No update from Igsas\\nNo updates were available after Igsas closed an import tender for 5,000 mt caprolactam grade AS April 10, but suggestions are that the session was scrapped.\\nFrance: Limited demand as most product already secured\\nThe French UAN-30 market is quiet with most prompt tonnes required already secured. The limited quantity sold is still priced at €228-230/mt FCA. Scarce interest is noted this week in forward tonnes.\\nDemand is expected to increase in the coming weeks as corn sowing has already got under way.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nEgypt: Abu Qir issues new UAN tender\\nAbu Qir issued a sales tender for 25,000 mt UAN-32 closing April 21 for April 25-28 lifting.\\nLast week the supplier managed to sell just 4,000 mt marginally below $210/mt FOB to Ameropa for prompt lifting to Spain under its April 7 re-tender.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Quiet market as conference takes place\\nNo new AS business was reported concluded out of China this week as market participants attended an industry conference. Suppliers continue to offer limited quantities of caprolactam grade product at $128- 129/mt FOB.\\nAMMONIA\\nANALYSIS\\nFears of a double dip in ammonia values west of Suez\\nA marginal uptick in spot activity is noted west of Suez but not enough to edge prices upwards. If anything, Black Sea values remain under considerable downwards pressure owing to ample supply and weak demand.\\nFears of a double dip in Yuzhnny values are a real concern expressed by several suppliers. OCP is already claiming procurement of Black Sea tonnage at netbacks on recent concluded business below $390/mt FOB although this has been refuted by producers and traders in the region.\\nKoch and Trammo are otherwise keeping the market alive with the latter securing another 15,000 mt from NF Trading at around $400/mt FOB Yuzhnny for late April lifting. Speculation concerning the destination of Koch’s 40,000 mt Clipper Neptun cargo which peaked participants’ interest last week gave way to the news April 14 that the vessel is indeed headed for Taft/USA as had originally been scheduled. Koch is now reported to be seeking a similar volume for late May lifting possibly to be used against contract commitments in the East with OPZ approached to supply a part cargo.\\nNot satisfied with recent cargoes from both Yuzhnny and the Baltic, Koch has also directed the Jenny N to load a full 40,000 mt from Sorfert Algeria at the end of April. It is unclear whether the lifting relates to a new spot deal or an execution of a purchase concluded in October 2014 which has not yet been picked up.\\nFurther adding to possible fears of oversupply and falling prices came with the news this week that owing to a shutdown of its Trinidad urea facility, PCS had three additional ammonia cargoes on offer for prompt lifting. Yara has already snapped 15,000 mt up for shipment to the US at prevailing market values while PCS was heard to offering cargoes to potential buyers in Europe at press time.\\nPotashCorp\\'s decision to export more ammonia from Trinidad comes at a poor time for suppliers given upcoming negotiations between Yara and Mosaic regarding May pricing for tons to Tampa. The phosphate producer already was arguing that falling phosphate values should stem any further increase, as seen for April Tampa prices.\\nWith ammonia application work accelerating in inland US, time is closing in on whether urea will steal any market share from ammonia for side-dress applications later this spring for corn. At press time, inland urea\\nvalues had gained modestly compared to prior weeks, suggesting the potential greater demand for urea was being felt in the marketplace. Higher urea prices naturally will reduce buyers\\' motivation to switch sources of nitrogen.\\nEast of Suez interest in ammonia is almost inexistent. Middle Eastern suppliers are reported offering up to two additional cargoes for May lifting but so far no news deals are reported concluded. Indian ammonia plant turnarounds continue to keep a lid on demand while Far Eastern consumers have rejected various spot offers in expectation of further price falls, possibly to the level of $450/mt CFR.\\nHighlights of the week:\\n∙Trammo buys 15,000 mt from NF around $400/mt FOB\\n∙Koch’s Clipper Neptun to head for Taft/USA\\n∙Koch looking for more Yuzhnny cargo for May lifting\\n∙OCI picks up 15,000 mt Baltic ammonia for own Rotterdam facility\\n∙Trammo sells small parcel to Igsas at $430/mt CFR with credit\\n∙OCP claims Black Sea ammonia secured below $390/mt FOB netbacks\\n∙Koch’s Jenny N directed to Algeria to load Sorfert cargo\\n∙PCS sells spot cargo ex-Trinidad to Yara, two other cargoes available\\n∙East of Suez very quiet\\nShort term outlook\\nYet again producers west of Suez fear another dip in prices in the coming weeks as demand remains poor and supply ample.\\nAmmonia versus DAP\\nOCP is granulating at full capacity this month and whereas much of the production is for lower analysis products, the N content is the same or higher than standard DAP or MAP. As such demand for ammonia through April at least should be good. The outlook for May will depend on when the Brazilian season gets under way. If delayed into May, OCP has indicated that it will ship incerased quantities of phosacid into India instead, thereby reducing its potential demand for ammonia accordingly.\\nCaprolactam versus ammonia\\nCaprolactam prices reached $1,680-1,700/mt CFR China this week. Prices are expected to gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Midwest: Pre-plant applications moving fast\\nWarmer, dryer weather has enabled retailers to make substantial progress in ammonia applications over the last week. As a result retailers are trying to come to grips with how much ammonia they will need for subsequent side-dress demand once corn emerges in the region. Urea was a better buy on paper in prior weeks, but a jump in pricing for that product this week reflects in part the possibility that some retailers were likely to buy more to substitute for ammonia. If the bump in urea values continues and ammonia pricing softens at all, there ultimately will be little switching between ammonia to urea this season. Ammonia postings are as high as $630/st FOB in some places, but cheaper values are cited west of the Mississippi River.\\nUS Gulf: Spot ammonia cargo bought by Yara\\nYara has bought 15-20,000 mt of ammonia from PotashCorp that will be lifted for the US Gulf likely by the end of the month. However, the price tag for the transaction was not available at press time, with market sources suggesting only that it likely was in line with the current market.\\nPotashCorp has additional spot ammonia to add to the US Gulf and other enduser markets in April and possibly forward as it idled its urea train in Trinidad and Tobago in favor of selling ammonia. The latter product currently is more profitable. Furthermore, a natural gas supply curtailment planned this month for that country will cut into all nitrogen production.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nTrinidad and Tobago: PotashCorp adds to NH3 export availability\\nPotashCorp has idled its granular urea unit, the only such plant in Trinidad and Tobago, starting this month in favor of selling more ammonia into the export market. The driver behind the decision is the plunging value of urea versus ammonia globally. The move could free up as much as 37,000 mt/month of ammonia for export, but this assumes gas supplies allowed the ammonia plants to run at capacity in Trinidad and Tobago, a rare event.\\nThe move coincides with reduced gas availability in Trinidad and Tobago for all nitrogen producers due to the ongoing work to improve logistics and bring new offshore gas platforms on line. The National Gas Co. has indicated an 11-day curtailment at about a 15% rate starting this week, but indications from the gas distributor historically have been optimistic. Therefore, sources at PotashCorp were not willing to predict how long the urea unit would be down.\\nFORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU)\\nBaltic Sea: OCI loads Navigator Galaxy cargo\\nOCI is linked to the purchase of a 15,000 mt spot cargo out of Sillamae this week which was loaded on the Navigator Galaxy bound for OCI’s own system in Rotterdam. No further details were known at press time.\\nBlack Sea: Spot activity picks up on NF sale\\nTrammo has secured 15,000 mt Black Sea ammonia from NF Trading this week at $400-410/mt FOB. The cargo will be lifted April 27-30 on the Marycam Swan likely for Turkey/Israel.\\nThe vessel has just finished loading a return 14,000 mt swap cargo from Ameropa, topped off by a small spot parcel from the supplier priced around $400/mt FOB April 14 and is now on her way to Aliaga, Turkey to be used against previous Trammo commitments.\\nKoch is reported once again seeking up to 40,000 mt Black Sea ammonia for loading in late May and has approached OPZ for a part cargo. There is speculation that once secured these volumes are will be placed in the Far East.\\nThis follows reports that OPZ is in discussions with an unnamed trader for the spot sale of 23,000 mt for April/May shipment.\\nKoch’s Clipper Neptun is scheduled to arrive in Yuzhnny April 17 after securing tonnage from OPZ late March. The vessel is now understood to be headed for Taft/USA after completion of loading.\\nIt is uncertain whether OPZ will begin selling some of its ammonia and urea via electronic auctions by late April as has been widely reported.\\nShipments and fully firm nominations for April are now above 310,000 mt:\\n\\nEUROPE\\nBelgium: BASF focuses on contracts\\nBASF is focusing on contract deliveries from Ameropa at present despite approaches by several suppliers keen to sell spot cargoes.\\nTurkey: Igsas buys more ammonia\\nIt emerged this week that Trammo recently sold 6-7,000 mt to Igsas around $430/mt CFR. The deal was likely concluded with a minimum of 180 days credit, suggesting cost of finance of about $6/mt.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMiddle East: Spot cargoes available for May lifting\\nMiddle Eastern producers are reported offering spot cargoes for May lifting but no new business had\\nbeen concluded at press time. Prices remain indicatively assessed as low as $380/mt FOB on weak demand from India and the Far East.\\nMorocco: Ammonia imports still steady\\nOCP continues to import ammonia cargoes claiming recent business has been concluded at $420-430/mt CFR. This has not been confirmed by Black Sea sellers.\\nOCP’s recently fixed OPZ cargo to be loaded on the Gaschem Stade is rumoured to be a semi-\\npermenant deal with the option to extend the arrangement after an initial three months. The vessel will arrive in Morocco in the first half of May.\\nAlgeria: Koch\\'s Jenny N heads for Arzew\\nKoch’s Jenny N is headed to Algeria to load 40,000 mt at the end of April following a spot purchase. It is unclear whether this a new transaction or a belated loading of the 40,000 mt secured by Koch from Sorfert in October last year which it has not yet picked up.\\nSorfert will load up to 70,000 mt in April against previous commitments.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Prices stable but could fall further\\nIndian ammonia values remain at $420-440/mt CFR amid limited demand and plant turnarounds. Downwards pressure is still being applied to prices by buyers who are keen to see prices fall by another $20/mt:\\nAmmonia imports into India for April so far total almost 64,000 mt:\\n\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: SFC not booking Koch cargo yet\\nSFC said it remains in discussions with Koch over a contract delivery of 20-30,000 mt for June/July delivery. It ruled itself out as a buyer of Koch cargo off the Clipper Neptun due to load 40,000 mt in Yuzhnny April 17. That vessel is now reported headed for Taft/USA.\\nSFC is reluctant to secure contract tonnage from Koch at present owing to cheaper product on offer from the Middle East. The buyer was approached by several suppliers this week to gauge interest in May spot cargoes around 10,000 mt, with offers rumoured as low as $450/mt CFR.\\nThe buyer will receive 10,000 mt ex-Indonesia contract tonnes from Trammo at the end of April off the Brussels followed by 23,000 mt from Sabic mid-May.\\nPHOSPHATES\\nANALYSIS\\nCrop prices yet again take their toll on fertilizer demand with the US market the latest to be affected\\nUS domestic demand appears set to take a substantial hit this spring, as market sources throughout the supply chain report farmers will cut application rates in the key growing areas by around 20% per acre due to low crop values versus fertilizer input costs.\\nUntil recently suppliers had hoped that contract requirements to maintain specified levels of fertility on rented ground would help support demand, but reports to Fertilizer Week are that renters and landowners have agreed that sticking to normal application rates will simply produce losses for renters. The bad news for suppliers comes even as seasonal demand emerges in the US Midwest and Southern Plains. While this has been supportive of current pricing, the supply chain is well stocked according to distributors. Expectations are that cheaper input costs next year will allow US farmers to return to historical application rates. However, there are no confirmed reports of fill pricing from Mosaic for the summer.\\nElsewhere the market has been seasonally quiet with many of the major players in China this week. Indian importers are taking a breather having lined up sufficient tonnes to cover immediate requirements and build up a buffer stock ahead of the season. They are also awaiting final confirmation of the NBS rates, which although are expected to remain largely unchanged, will need to be confirmed to give real clarity on pricing.\\nChinese producers meanwhile are relaxed with a solid quantity of export business on the books for the major producers in India and some curtailments as a result of planned maintenance. As such they are holding firm on price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB with many still citing numbers at the mid-upper end of this range. Buyers are quoting lower numbers and rumours have been circulating that sales in the mid $470s/mt CFR India have been concluded however there is no firm evidence as yet to back up these\\nreports. Nevetheless buyers are putting pressure on Chinese suppliers to reduce prices below $480/mt CFR for the next round of import purchasing. If values for non-Chinese product hold in the mid $480s/mt CFR for India, then US exports also will be competitive in that market.\\nIn Brazil the import campaign is yet to start. However the freefall in price indications seen in recent weeks appears to have been halted with Russian producers said to be offering at higher levels for May. Mosaic meanwhile has dropped its export price down to $460-463/mt FOB which although moving in the right direction is still equating to a CFR level well above current indications from Brazilian buyers. Current in Brazil prices remain unsupported by any real volumes but perhaps a floor, albeit temporary, has been found.\\nHighlights of the Week\\n∙Mosaic drops its price to $460-463/mt FOB Tampa\\n∙Rollover in NW European phosphoric acid contracts for Q2\\n∙Rumours of lower prices in India but no firm confirmation\\n∙NBS rates yet to be announced\\n∙Chinese prices remain in range of $460-470/mt FOB\\n∙Bangladesh to issue tender for private sector import of DAP and TSP\\nShort Term Outlook\\nThe market is likely to remain quiet through to May and even mid-May by which time most producers will have completed their respective turnarounds. Although the market will remain weak until then, it will stabilise as the key importers return to the marketplace such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh and Turkey. The import prospects for India and Pakistan are looking positive, given a normal monsoon, while the longer the Brazilians delay, the shorter the import window and the more condensed it will become. As such the market could get quite interesting by June particularlry as two major Chinese producers are foregoing MAP production and concentrating their efforts on DAP only. The potential downside risk could come from increased production in Morocco as OCP ramps up JPH-1, but OCP has proved that it will curtail production if demand warrants such a move.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Tampa: Export benchmark moves down\\nThe Tampa benchmark fell by as much as $10/mt this week with a sale by Mosaic of 15,000 mt of DAP sold to Latin America at $460-463/mt FOB for May shipment. In the meantime, rumors of possible sales of DAP cargos to India continued. The decline in US Gulf Q2 liquid sulphur costs likely making that market more attractive over the summer. It also reduces the likelihood of market related curtailments. However, some traders believe Mosaic may consider such a move depending on upcoming MAP pricing for Brazil and elsewhere.\\nUS Midwest: DAP moving, but demand expectations lower\\nExpectations about spring demand for DAP and MAP have been replaced by reports of deliveries of previously ordered material and new spot sales.\\nWhile phosphates are moving, distributors say it has become apparent that farmers are cutting phosphate application rates, even on rented ground. Landowners understand that renters will lose money if fertility requirements in contracts are enforced to the letter this year, given current input costs, land rents and new crop pricing. Anecdotal reports expect demand in the Midwest region to be off by around 20% compared to the prior year, although much of that decline will be due to fewer corn acres in the region compared to last year. Prices for truck loads remain around $460/st FOB.\\nUS New Orleans: Barge values flat with steady demand\\nMost DAP trades in the US barge market were cited around $410/st FOB this week for barges in the Gulf or prompt load dates.\\nBarges up the river traded at higher values, with Cairo Illinois and St. Louis Missouri business still cited around, $415-$420/st FOB, in line with last week. Reports of trades, bids and offers for MAP barges are across a range either with no premium to DAP to up to $5/st more expensive.\\nBuyers’ timidity in prior weeks and even in the current market is helping to support New Orleans prices in the near term, with endusers exhausting alternatives before committing to further barges. This has left sellers in a position of strength. However, inland buyers are buying only with this season in mind.\\nUS: Export rate continued to gain through March\\nUS DAP and MAP export volumes in March of this year were 169,111 st (153,416 mt) P2O5, up from 142,873 st (129,613 mt) P2O5, according to the latest producer data from The Fertilizer Institute.\\nThis trend continued for much of the current fertilizer year that has seen US exports stay moderately ahead of July-March shipments in the previous year , at 1.59 million st (1.44 million mt) P2O5 this year versus 1.36 million st (1.24 million mt) P2O5 for 2013/14.\\nA comparison of export destinations between March of this year and March 2014 does not show a significant difference in destinations. Primary destinations for US DAP/MAP during March of this year included Brazil at 47,788 st P2O5, Mexico at 20,941 st P2O5 and Australia at 18,346 st P2O5.\\nFor the first nine months of the current fertilizer year through March, US DAP/MAP exports were dominated by its historically key customers of Brazil at 340,551 st P2O5, India at 258,629 st P2O5 and Canada at 258,375 st P2O5.\\nMexico: Fertinal committed through May\\nFertinal is committed through May with shipments to South America and the domestic market.\\nWith the Australian shipping programme now over, Fertinal has shifted its attention to markets closer to home until the Australian season resumes later in the year. As such it has just finished loading 33,000 mt DAP/MAP on the Orient Tide for Ameropa/Argentina and Uruguay, as reported previously. The tonnes were priced on a formula basis.\\nThis will be followed by a 35-40,000 mt DAP/MAP/TSP cargo for Chile loading late April and a second Latin American cargo is believed to be loading in May. In addition, Fertinal will be supplying the domestic market and on the basis of all these shipments, will therefore be fully committed through to June. Price levels remain unchanged in the $460s/470/mt FOB range. It is now discussing H1 June business.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Little change as buyers continue to take as needed\\nThe market remains unchanged in terms of demand but prices have continued to weaken over the past couple of weeks.\\nBrazilian buyers are yet to really show their hand and return to the market in earnest for the main import season. There appears to be no rush and at least two major suppliers are prepared for further delays to the start of the import campaign. Price indications for MAP remain weak although there are signs that maybe a floor has, at least temporarily, been reached.\\nFollowing reports last week of Russian offers as low as $460/mt CFR, it would appear that these have now moved up with talk of $470/mt CFR being indicated for May. Again speculation over price is rife with price levels varying depending on whether traders are long or short and with a lack of volume sales to support any true price.\\nOCP has refrained from shipping any MAP this month but has sold around 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S to various buyers in the $470s/mt CFR for April shipment in four lots. This will be used both for blending as well as direct application and could displace some demand for 11-44-0 where the additional sulphur is needed.\\nMosaic has dropped its price once again, this time indicating a price out of Tampa of $460-463/mt FOB equating to the upper $470s/480/mt CFR Brazil level , still above current indications from the buyers.\\nChinese MAP producers are foregoing MAP where they can and producing DAP instead in order to take advantage of better netbacks in Asian markets. With two major producers, Hubei Yihua and Wengfu not producing any MAP grades at all for export this year, it will be interesting to see how this affects availability of these grades for the Brazilian market through the key import months.\\nBrazil: Q1 P2O5 consumption falls 13% year on year\\nDespite some improvement in March, Brazilian P2O5 consumption fell by 13% overall in Q1.\\nLatest ANDA data show that consumption of P2O5 in March fell by 3% against 2014 and although an improvement on January and February, overall sales in Q1 fell 13% year on year.\\nNevertheless despite not reaching the record levels of 2014, Brazil consumed 44% and 48% more P2O5 in Q1 this year than it did in 2013 and 2012 respectively.\\nBrazil: P2O5 Consumption by Month (‘000 mt P2O5)\\n% change\\nSource: ANDA\\nLooking at import volumes there is a clear and sharp decline in the import quantity of almost all phosphate fertilizers, particularly MAP, in Q1 but only when compared with 2014. If we compare the volumes of MAP and DAP to 2013, imports this year were up by 19% and 15% respectively.\\nAverage Q1 imports for the past three years, between 2011 and 2013, were 385,000 mt so this year\\'s imports have been only marginally below this number.\\nThis all reinforces the view that Q1 2014 was an anomaly prompted by higher crop prices, lower fertilizer prices (just $410-420/mt CFR Brazil when buyers first returned to the market) and greater confidence in the market arising from, amongst other factors, a more stable exchange rate. As reported previously in Fertilizer Week, this year Brazil has merely reverted to its normal seasonal buying patterns.\\nBrazil: Imports and Production (‘000 mt Product)\\nMAP Imports arrived in Q2 (‘000 mt product)\\n857 737\\nTaking all the available data, it becomes clear that availability in Brazil remains at manageable levels and comparable with last year, even accounting for the drop in consumption and a higher surplus at the end of 2014. As such, demand in Q2 should be relatively robust and even allowing for a less bouyant agricultural and economic backdrop, should translate into steady demand going forward.\\nSource: ANDA * excluding any surplus from previous years\\nCONAB has also released its monthly update projecteding total corn production at 79 million tonnes, with the full season crop seen at 30.3 million and safrinha 48.7 million. Although 10% of Mato Grosso safrinha planting in occurred outside the ideal planting window, conditions have been very good and encourage good crop growth. However, late April and early May will be the key yield determining period. CONAB has also raised its forecast for soyabean production to 94.3 million tonnes, exceeding the previous record by over 5 million tonnes.\\nVenezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014\\nVenezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland\\'s Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.\\nEUROPE\\nBulgaria: Iran emerges as Agropolichim\\'s TSP primary market\\nLatest GTIS data for January show Agropolichim export 31,500 mt TSP to Iran that month. There were no other exports of TSP, DAP or MAP in January.\\nBulgarian TSP exports reached a high of 226,000 mt in 2014 of which 157,000 mt were shipped to Iran, almost 70% of all Agropolichim\\'s export availability. The balance was delivered into West Europe with 24,000 mt each to Belgium and France and small lots to other West European markets.\\nWith more emphasis being given to TSP, export availability of MAP was lower in 2014 while DAP remained unchanged from the previous year. Just 20,000 mt MAP were exported last year in small lots to Romania, Hungary and Austria. Of the DAP, 42,000 mt went into Romania although some of this may have been transported further into Europe.\\nBulgaria: Syrian rock imports continue at a steady pace.\\nAgropolichim imported 25,000 mt Jordanian rock in January this year according to the latest GTIS data, along with a further 9,000 mt from Syria.\\nFor calendar year 2014, phosphate rock imports reached a high of 578,000 mt comprising 231,000 mt from Syria, 216,000 mt from Morocco and 130,000 mt from Jordan. Syrian deliveries have remained at an average of 222,000 mt per year since 2012 but in the two previous years, the volume was well over 300,000 mt. The quantity from Morocco jumped last year, mainly displacing tonnage from Jordan.\\nPoland: More rock arriving from Senegal\\nPoland imported 100,000 mt phosphate rock in January this year, according to the latest GTIS data.\\nCargoes came in from Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and a further 10,000 mt from Israel.\\nVolumes from Grupa Azoty\\'s own reserves in Senegal have been increasing slowly but steadily since 2013. In calendar year 2014, a total of 220,000 mt Senegalese rock were shipped to Szczecin of which 150,000 mt were shipped in H2.\\nOverall imports in 2014 from all sources reached 1,266 million mt with Algeria supplying 564,000 mt or 45% of the total. Additional quantities came in from Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Togo, Turkey and Israel.\\nPoland: Further growth in NPK exports to Venezuela\\nGTIS data for January show 15,000 mt Polish DAP delivered into Germany.\\nJust 52,000 mt DAP were exported in 2014 which although a higher volume than in 2013, was still considerably lower than in previous years. Police has continued to place greater emphasis on the production of NPs and NPKs.\\nIn January Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark. Total exports in calendar year 2014 reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity more than 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons probably being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.\\nPoland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.\\nTurkey: DAP tender scrapped and negotiations continue\\nIgsas scrapped its tender of April 10 for 10,000 mt DAP.\\nGubretas continues to negotiate its annual phosphate requirement with GCT/Tunisia. An agreement is expected shortly.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP well committed through April\\nOCP is well committed through April but with limited DAP and MAP shipments.\\nOCP remains well committed through April and into early May with shipments to Africa, Europe and\\nBrazil. However, no DAP, MAP or TSP will be shipped to Brazil this month, instead OCP will ship 100,000 mt NPS 12-46-0+7S in four shipments sold in the mid $470s/mt CFR to various importers including Heringer. The product will be used both in blending and for direct application. OCP has indicated that it is not interested in the recent low prices seen in Brazil for MAP and if solid demand is still not evident in May, it will ship further quantities of phosacid into India.\\nLooking at the rest of the April line-up, as reported previously in Fertilizer Week, OCP will also load the balance of its Ethiopian cargoes, a total of 150,000 mt in three lots. The first has already loaded, the second will load shortly and the third will load at the end of the month/early May.\\nIn addition it will load close to 100,000 mt DAP/MAP/NPKs to other African markets including 16,000 mt DAP to Mali/Senegal, 5,000 mt to the Ivory Coast, 6,000 mt MAP to Algeria, and 25,000 mt DAP/MAP to South Africa (mainly DAP). Additional NPKs will be delivered into Nigeria.\\nJust 25-30,000 mt DAP will have been delivered into Europe in April, sold between $510-515/mt FOB Jorf Lasfar including sales to Fertiberia/Spain.\\nOCP will also load two lots of MAP, one 6,000 mt parcel for Italy sold at a premium to DAP for non-fertilizer use, and the second cargo comprising 8,000 mt high grade MAP for Mexico.\\nThe domestic market will take 25-30,000 mt DAP and NPKs in April. Morocco has raised its wheat import duty to 75% to help protect the local cereal crop, which is expected to see a bumper harvest of 10 million tonnes (6.7 million in 2014).\\nThis all equates to around 360,000 mt DAP in product tonnes equivalent when calculated on a P2O5\\nbasis. OCP has total granulation capacity of nearer 500,000 mt DAP per month but only if phosphoric acid is diverted from export use. Otherwise when phosacid exports are back up to the normal (higher levels i.e. this month) it is nearer 350,000 mt.\\nIn addition to this, OCP will ship 110-120,000 mt P2O5 phosphoric acid to India, around 15,000 mt to Saudi Arabia and, regular quantities to Brazil and Europe and the normal 30-35,000 mt P2O5 to Pakistan from the Pak-Maroc joint venture plant.\\nNW Europe: Rollover agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts\\nA rollover has been agreed for Q2 phosphoric acid contracts in NW Europe.\\nAn agreement was reached last week between OCP and its customers in NW Europe for the Q1 price for phosphoric acid to be rolled over into Q2. As such the price range for CFR NW Europe will remain unchanged at $900-990/mt P2O5 CFR NW Europe for shipments up to and including June. Some Moroccan contracts were agreed at slightly higher prices but the overall range remains unchanged. Phosacid from non- Moroccan sources remains at the more competitive end of the price range while the upper end of the price range represents a higher grade Moroccan acid to customers taking smaller quantities.\\nTunisia: Severe curtailments again hit phosphate rock production\\nYet again production of phosphate rock in Tunisia has been severely curtailed by sit-ins and local unrest.\\nFor the second consecutive week, production and/or transport of rock has been halted at most of the major mines in the Gafsa region, including Redayef, Oum Larayes , Metaloui , Kef Eddour and Kef\\nChefayer. According to local press reports, only the mine and beneficiation facilities at M\\'dhilla are currently operating. Unemployed protesters have been organising sit-ins at a number of the mines as well as the railway stations at Redayef and Oum Larayes while also blocking water supplies to the mines.\\nRail transport is however operating between Metaloui and Mdhilla to feed the downstream plants at Gabes, M\\'dhilla and La Skhira (including Tifert). Private truck companies are also being used to transport the rock to the plants to meet ongoing off-shore commitments.\\nAs a result of the problems, rock production is reported to have fallen to an estimated 15% capacity.\\nAccording to a statement made to the press by the director general of the CPG (Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa), Q1 production of phosphate rock failed to meet its original target of 1.56 million mt. Instead output\\nfell almost 40% against Q1 2014, to just 604,000 mt in the first three months of this year compared with 983,000 mt last year.\\nIt was only recently that the new government had announced that it had made the phosphate industry in Gafsa one of its priorities for its first 100 days of office, as reported by Fertilizer Week April 2. It had laid out plans for the production of rock to reach 500,000 mt per month in March, April and May but clearly this volume will not be reached in March/April. Officials have stated that continued efforts are being made to find solutions to \"this very difficult situation\".This included setting out a new set of measures at a high level meeting on April 13 to re-examine the cause of the problems, conducting an audit on the management approach of CPG and its subsidiaries to ensure \"good governance\", sending a government delagation to the region to address the problems first hand and dedicating a in Inner Cabinet meeting to the situation in May.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Market quiet and rumours abound\\nAs most of the traders and importers gather in China this week, rumours of cargoes being traded at lower prices, in the mid $470s/mt have been circulating.\\nSo far there is little evidence backing up these reports and even a number of the major buyers are refuting these rumours. Although prices for Chinese tonnage may fall below the $480/mt CFR level, they are not expected to fall dramatically. Chinese suppliers are holding firm to current prices in the range of $460-470/mt FOB and show no intention to drop prices further in the near future. Indian CFR prices at or around $480/mt equates back to the mid/upper $460s excluding any trader\\'s margin.\\nA delegation from PhosAgro visited India last week and further DAP/NPK cargoes are said to have been sold in addition to the NPK cargoes previously sold to Deepak and IPL and the DAP cargo to IFFCO; the DAP in these cargoes was priced in the mid $480s/mt CFR. Further details on the new business have not yet been confirmed and may not be until the NBS rates are formally announced.\\nUttar Pradesh Co-op is expected to issue a re-tender for 100,000 mt DAP. Hudson was awarded the full quantity from the original tender at $478/mt CFR held in January but failed to deliver.\\nRCF has still not awarded any tonnage against its DAP tender of March 16 for 65,000 mt and it is widely thought that this tender will be scrapped.\\nThe NBS rates have not yet been announced. Whereas last year they were announced at the beginning of April, in 2013 the announcement was not made until May 2.\\nJust over 1 million mt DAP has been confirmed to date, excluding new business from Russia. An estimated\\n2.4million mt DAP in the form of MoU agreements has been agreed to date between Saudi, Jordanian and Chinese suppliers and the major buyers for the current fertilizer year.\\nThe latest port data information is as follows:\\n\\n\\nIndia: Slow rate of Indian phosacid imports this month\\nIndian phosphoric acid imports appear to be relatively light so far this month.\\nA combination of higher prices, turnarounds and the delay in the announcement of the NBS rates appear to have caused phosphoric acid rates to slow down this month. However, with OCP planning to ship 110- 120,000 mt P2O5 in April and again in May to India, arrivals should soon start to pick up.\\nIndia: Q2 Rock contracts yet to get started\\nNegotiations are yet to start for Q2 phosphate rock contracts in India and may not until the NBS rates are formally announced giving clarity on the subsidy and market prices going forward.\\nSuppliers will be pushing for an increase in the wake of the $40/mt P2O5 hike in phosphoric acid prices for H1. Buyers will be citing the weak DAP market. DAP production in India via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option, particularly given the lower sulphur prices. If buyers achieve a good price for Q2 rock which maintains this advantage, we can expect a robust level of imports going forward.\\nImports to date for this calendar year stand at 2.31 million mt,a little less than this time last year. Imports for the full four months between January-April totalled 2.8 million mt with 837,000 mt arriving in April alone.\\n\\nIndia: MMTC issues new DAP tender\\nMMTC issued a DAP tender for 30,000 mt black or dark brown DAP (18-46-0) +/- 10%, closing 1400 hrs in New Delhi on April 23 for prompt shipment to Mundra, Vizag or Kakinada. Both technical and price offers will be opened on April 23. Offers to be remain valid for 15 days.\\nBangladesh: Tender to be issued for private sector DAP/TSP requirement\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has decided to issue a tender to determine the supply of the forthcoming crop year\\'s DAP and TSP import requirement via the private sector.\\nA total of 400,000 mt DAP and 200,000 mt TSP may be imported through private sector companies in 2015/16 and a tender to this effect is expected to be announced shortly, to close end April/early May.\\nThis quantity is below the quotas given to the private sector last year for 2014/15 of 460,000 mt DAP and 250,000 mt TSP. Against this quantity 220,000 mt DAP were supplied from China and 136,000 mt DAP from Australia. China used to be a major supplier of TSP to Bangladesh, shipping 400,000 mt in 2009, but since 2012 there have been no imports of Chinese TSP due to alledged quality issues.\\nIn calendar year 2014, against the long standing government-government agreement, BADC (Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation) imported an additional 150,000 mt DAP and 190,000 mt TSP from OCP/Morocco and 300,000 mt TSP from GCT/Tunisia according to GTIS and IFA data. A similar quantity will be allocated to the public sector again for 2015/16. OCP has been shipping more TSP in Q1 to Bangladesh due to supply issues from Tunisia.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: Producers aim to hold firm on price\\nAs much of the industry gathers in China this week, the main topic is the Chinese DAP price going forward.\\nChinese producers are holding firm on the DAP price in the range of $460-470/mt FOB. There have been rumours of sales concluded in the mid $470s/mt CFR India but as yet no firm evidence to back them\\nup. Indian buyers are putting pressure on the Chinese to drop the price below $480/mt CFR, a price which gives a netback in the mid-high $460s/mt FOB China excluding traders\\' margin. Hubei producers generally have a freight advantage but producers like YUC are not only selling direct but also ship panamax vessels, again giving a more attractive netback.\\nAs Indian demand slows down following the rush of buying seen in recent weeks, Chinese producers are taking advantage of the quieter period to undertake annual maintenance. Both YUC and Kailin are taking rolling turnarounds through April and into May which will reduce overall production by around 25-\\n30%.Wengfu started its month long maintenance programme this week, taking each of its two phosphoric acid units down at a time, thereby reducing overall production by 50%.\\nAs reported previously in Fertilizer Week, both Wengfu and Hubei Yihua are now focusing almost exclusively on DAP, foregoing production of all grades of MAP in favour of DAP, and in the case of Wengfu, purified phosphoric acid or PPA. Having not sold any DAP into India at all in 2014, Wengfu will be looking to establish a presence in this all important market this year and already we have seen it sell three cargoes to CIL with a fourth on offer, at competitive prices relative to other suppliers.\\nMost producers are bypassing granular MAP for export due to the low netbacks currently being seen in the Brazilian market as the return on DAP remains significantly higher. Even at $470/mt CFR Brazil for granular 11-52-0, the netback would be close to $440/mt FOB China, well below the equivalent netback for DAP in India and more costly to produce.\\nIt remains to be seen how the absence of two of the major producers will affect availability of MAP once the Brazilian season gets under way in earnest. Certainly prices will have to improve to prompt other producers, with the flexibility to switch between products, to move away from DAP and back to MAP especially as Indian DAP demand is forecast to see a solid improvement on 2014.\\nThe issue of VAT has once again come to the fore. Latest speculation suggests that the government will re- introduce VAT on fertilizer sales from September this year at a rate of 13%. Producers will be able to offset VAT already paid on raw materials and other inputs against this rate. As such, CRU estimates that the VAT will mean that producers are looking at an additional cost of between RMB 50-100/mt on the cost of producing DAP.\\nThe National Bureau of Statistics sees rice plantings in China expanding 1.2% this year, with corn up 1.9%. This will help to boost domestic fertilizer demand.\\nPOTASH\\nANALYSIS\\nIndian potash contract wait continues as Uralkali confirms Chinese volumes\\nPrices in the potash spot markets remain at stable lows with some further drops as the new Indian potash contract remains elusive, slowing suppliers\\' attempts to recover potash prices through Q2.\\nUralkali signed its quantity agreement to China late April 10, announcing firm seaborne volumes of 850,000 mt to Sinochem, CNAMPGC and CNOOC. Canpotex recently concluded a 1.8 million mt firm agreement, BPC signed a firm 1.7 million mt and APC a firm 600,000 mt. All deals were done at $315/mt CFR.\\nWith roughly 1.3 million mt of seaborne volumes sent by Uralkali to China in 2014, the 850,000 mt deal may be a signal that Uralkali could reduce its exports to China in 2015 following the loss of production from Solikamsk-2 late in 2014. Uralkali also tends to send 1.3 million mt to China by rail.\\nIn addition, ICL may not be able to sign any H1 volumes contract with China as negotiations with striking workers at the Dead Sea Works at an impasse this week. Without production from the site ICL is unlikely to secure agreements. Strikes began in mid-February and ICL may already have foregone roughly 500,000 mt of production.\\nWith more settlements of the 2015 potash contracts, Chinese domestic prices keep sliding further towards the new price. Port wholesale prices are down by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) already, compared to the prices before the first contract settlement on March 19. This week mainstream port wholesale prices for Russian red standard MOP on the whole remain stable at RMB 2,050/mt ($330/mt) FCA, while the low end has dropped to RMB 2,030/mt ($327/mt) FCA.\\nIn addition, QSL slashed its potash prices by an average of RMB 130/mt this week. Its price of standard crystal MOP is now RMB 2,000/mt ($323/mt) CPT while its price for standard powdered MOP is RMB 1,960/mt ($316/mt) CPT.\\nBrazilian prices remain at the very weak level of $325-345/mt CFR this week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels holding down the price. The low end of prices is only $10/mt above the new Chinese contract price. Many suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt CFR level with sales expected to build up in the coming months.\\nEurope remains at a similar weak level to Brazil with granular prices still at €300-310/mt CIF as suppliers struggle to achieve deals at €315/mt CIF. The top end of the current range represents only $333/mt at current exchange rates.\\nIn the US, worries are building over demand in the Midwest due to low corn and soybean values in recent weeks. Reports have indicated that there could be as much as a 20% fall in potash application rates compared to last year. Despite this, US prices are unchanged at $340-350/st FOB New Orleans, $390-400/st FOB in the Midwest and $390-395/st FOB in the south, where demand has mostly been met.\\nIn Southeast Asia, prices are seen stable at $315-345/mt CFR but most suppliers and distributers have moved prices in Malaysia towards $330/mt CFR level and there are indications that the low end of the region\\'s price range will soon increase by $5-10/mt. Tender season builds up in May for Malaysia and a tender with H2 delivery for as much as 500,000 mt from Indonesia\\'s Petrokimia Gresik has been announced. Suppliers will hope that Q2 will see some key price recoveries in Southeast Asia.\\nThe new Indian contract price remains elusive with the Nutrient Based Subsidy still to be announced. Tenders in the country have again been pushed back due to the wait and India has continued to receive significant deliveries through April, giving buyers more negotiating power in the contract talks. It continues to be likely that an agreement will be made by the end of the month or into early May at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, roughly $330-337/mt CFR with 180 days credit but without an agreement suppliers continue to struggle to recover losses in the spot markets.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Uralkali signs seaborne Chinese quantity deal for 850,000 mt\\n∙ICL DSW strike talks hit another impasse\\n∙Chinese domestic prices fall to RMB 2,030-2,200/mt FCA\\n∙QSL cuts potash prices by an average RMB 130/mt\\n∙Brazil gMOP prices at weak $325-345/mt CFR\\n∙SE ASIA price stable $315-345/mt CFR\\n∙Europe price stable at €300-310/mt CIF\\n∙US prices stable, NOLA $340-350/st FOB, Midwest $390-400/st FOB, South $390-395/st FOB\\n∙Petrokimia Gresik tenders for ~500,000 mt potash\\n∙India\\'s MFL awards 15,000 mt potash tender to IPL at $324/mt CFR\\n∙Karnalyte Resources writes off Wynard Potash Project in Canada\\n∙Brazil\\'s March MOP imports fall by almost half, Q1 down 32% at 1.4 million mt\\n∙Indian NBS expected shortly, contract to be signed by end of April/early May\\nCorn, Soybean, Wheat and Rice vs Potash Pricing - Affordability Index\\nExplanation: the Affordability Index series compares an index of crop prices, weighted based on volumes traded through major price points for the four main agricultural commodities (wheat, corn, rice and soybeans), with a similar trade-weighted index of potash prices. When the fertilizer index falls relative to the crop index, this means that nutrients are increasingly\\naffordable to farmers, as a share of the return they will receive for their production. As the spread narrows or even inverts, this suggests that fertilizers become less affordable on farm.\\n\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS Southern Plains: Demand mostly met\\nPotash applications still are underway in the South, but many distributors report they believe they have enough product in place or moving through the supply chain to meet their market\\'s needs. Prices for granular product remains around $390-395/st FOB across the region.\\nUS Midwest: Application rates may suffer more than expected\\nGranular potash prices have not moved lower this week, but distributors are increasingly concerned that demand will be well below expectations due to low corn and soybean values compared to prior years.\\nSimilar reports have been heard for phosphates, with application rates for both products potentially falling around 20% compared to the prior year. Renters and landowners reportedly have put aside, or at least loosened fertility requirements for the current year as new crop prices will provide a loss to farmers given typical land rents.\\nPostings are as high as $410/st FOB on both sides of the Mississippi River, but most business appears to be getting done between $390-400/st FOB.\\nUS New Orleans: Potash barges do not gain on inland demand\\nTraders report granular potash barges can be had at $340-350/st FOB New Orleans in general, but bids are entirely at the bottom end of the range. Some traders with barge positions are concerned they will have carry-over tons at the end of the season.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nBrazil: Prices still seen as low as $325/mt CFR\\nBrazilian prices remain at the weak level of $325-345/mt CFR this week with stiff competition, limited buyer interest and high supply levels holding down the price.\\nBrazilian prices seemed to have hit their floor at $335-345/mt CFR a few weeks ago following the Chinese contract agreement but high levels of competition have continued to force down the key spot price.\\nBrazilian prices have now fallen by roughly $40/mt in the first four months of 2015 and are seen at their lowest level since February 2014. In April 2014, Brazilian gMOP prices were $15-20/mt above the current level.\\nCurrency depreciation and low agricultural prices have hit Brazilian farmers, who invested heavily last year. As a result, distributers and importers are defending their margins and resisting any price push at this point.\\nOn the other hand, freight rates to Brazil have seen significant drops in the last year due to Brazilian real depreciation. In the last year Baltic-Brazil rates are down 27%, Vancouver-Brazil rates are down 36% and Ashdod-Brazil prices are down 40%, representing roughly a $10/mt saving in CFR sales for suppliers compared to last year.\\nMany suppliers say they are not offering below $335/mt CFR and still hope that they can begin moving the price back up towards the $350/mt CFR level with sales expected to build up in the coming months.\\nBrazil: March MOP imports fall by almost half\\nIn March, Brazil imported 468,618 mt of potash, a 48% fall year on year as vessel arrivals fell well below the three-year average during Q1, according to ANDA data.\\nJanuary imports fell 4.4% year on year and its February imports fell 33% compared to the same month a year earlier as the collapsing real and high levels of competition without a Chinese contract benchmark hit import levels.\\nIn the first quarter, total MOP imports were down 32% year on year at 1.4 million mt. Total Q1 volumes going into Brazil were over 600,000 mt down on Q1 2014 but slightly above the Q1 2013 level.\\nLast year Brazil\\'s imports increased 19% to 9.1 million mt compared to 2013 as demand increased substantially in the Latin American country. Early indications due to the weak import data are that surpassing the 2014 level is unlikely.\\nThe line-up for fertilizer vessels seems to have jumped up in April, with the number of vessels due to arrive returning to its April level from 2014. Over 400,000 mt is believed to have been booked for arrival at the Antonina and Paranagua ports in April so far and it is likely that imports will now build towards a peak between July and October as in recent years:\\n\\nVenezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014\\nVenezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland\\'s Police plant.\\nMeanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.\\nChile: February potash exports fell almost 50%\\nSQM exported 40,629 mt of potash in February, a 49% fall on its February 2014 exports, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the month, small volumes under 10,000 mt were sent to Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, China and Guatemala.\\nAs a result, January and February\\'s combined exports are down 14% compared to the same period in 2014, at 161,953 mt.\\nEUROPE\\nEurope: NPK suppliers hope for more activity after better weather\\nNPK activity across Europe has been very weak in the last couple of months but with weather improving across the continent, some business is likely to build in the next few weeks.\\nWeak oil and wheat prices, euro depreciation, high levels of stocks and apprehension on the farmers\\' buying side all impacted NPK demand in Q1 and even reduced prices failed to attract significant buyers.\\nIndications for current Baltic NPK 15-15-15 and 16-16-16 prices are largely stable at an FOB level of $325- 335/mt and $340-350/mt respectively. Triple 15 offers are being made as low as $325/mt FOB, according to sources, but buyers are either disinterested or are bidding significantly lower.\\nPoland: Police exports 49,000 mt of NPKs in January\\nIn January Zaklady Chemiczne Police exported 49,000 mt NPKs including 20,000 mt for Venezuela and 11,000 mt for Denmark.\\nTotal exports in calendar year reached 346,000 mt, in line with the average since 2009. Of this quantity over 40% was shipped to Venezuela, a market that has been steadily growing in importance for Poland over the past five years. Interestingly there were no Polish exports to African markets in 2014, one of the reasons being the presence since last year of Moroccan NPKs in this region.\\nPoland exported no NPs in January. NP exports in 2014 reached 43,000 mt, largely split between Paraguay and Argentina.\\nEurope: Price remains stable in Europe\\nColder weather across Europe at the start of 2015 and a late start to application has meant that suppliers continue to struggle in attempts to get granular potash prices above €310/mt CIF.\\nEuropean granular prices remain in the €300-310/mt CIF range.\\nSuppliers hope that with indications around Europe of improved weather conditions, applications will build up and they can achieve their target prices.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Players await NBS and contract decision\\nThe Indian Nutrient Based Subsidy rates were expected by this week but it seems they have again been pushed back, damaging chances of a new contract being reached by the end of the month.\\nRCF and NFL\\'s potash tenders have both recently been pushed back until they hope an agreement is made while results from MMTC\\'s tender, which is considered cover for the RCF tender, are unlikely to be announced until the RCF tender is completed.\\nSuppliers were last heard looking for at least a $20/mt increase on the current $322/mt with 180 days credit deal but buyers were pushing for a rollover. It is likely that the contract will be signed at a similar increase to the Chinese contract, at around $330-337/mt CFR with 180 days.\\nRepresentatives of BPC were in India on April 14-15 as part of an official trade visit with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. It is unclear whether discussions were made regarding the new potash contract but it is likely.\\nQ1 deliveries to India were very high and more than 200,000 mt of potash continued to enter the country in April, allowing some buyers to build stocks and strengthen their negotiating power in the contract talks.\\nAs much as 54,224 mt of potash is due for arrival in the next week via two Canpotex shipments, to TCL and Mosaic, and one ICL delivery to Zuari.\\nMost buyers in India now expect that potash imports could hit a record five million mt in the fertilizer year 2015-16 but await clarification of the NBS rates, indications of the monsoon outlook and potash contract pricing before any firm forecasts. With 4.3 million mt likely to have been imported in the 2014-15 fertilizer year, the possible number would represent a strong 700,000 mt increase.\\n\\nIndia: NFL extends 50,000 mt potash tender\\nIndia\\'s National Fertilizers Ltd. extended the closing date on its tender for the import of 50,000 mt MOP.\\nThe closing date has been moved to April 30 from April 13 most likely in the hope that a new Indian contract will be agreed before then. The H1 2014 contract price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the new contract is likely to be signed by the end of April.\\nThe tender is for H1 May delivery in two shipments of 25,000 mt across multiple Indian ports.\\nIndia: MFL awards potash tender to IPL\\nIndian fertilizer producer MFL has awarded its April 2 tender for 15,000 mt of potash to IPL.\\nMFL received two offers, one from IPL at $324/mt CFR and another from Uzagro at $330/mt CFR, both with 180 days credit.\\nRepresentatives in the country are currently in negotiations over a new potash supply contract deal for 2015. The current price is $322/mt CFR with 180 days credit and the IPL/Uzagro offers should help suppliers in negotiations for a price increase.\\nThe tender is for delivery in April or May at Chennai port.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nChina: NPK demand falls as spring buying season ends\\nDomestic demand for NPK dropped in the last two weeks as the spring buying season came to an end. Compound fertilizer is now being applied to land throughout the country.\\nIn the last week, some NPK producers have published their prices for the summer market, which are mostly for high nitrogen compound products like 28-6-6. Some of their NPK prices fell slightly, partly because of the decline of demand and partly attributed to price falls in feedstock like ammonia and MAP.\\nThe 15-15-15 SOP based NPK is quoted between RMB 2,150-2,250/mt EXW and 15-15-15 Cl-based product is priced at RMB 1,750-1,900/mt EXW. For 18-6-6 high nitrogen compound, the price ranges between RMB 1,700-1,800/mt EXW.\\nWith price falls in nitrogen and MAP continuing and domestic potash prices also slipping towards a recently signed import contract price, questions remain over whether NPK prices have further to fall in China.\\nBut for NPK plants, there are some positive indications. During the spring, an important change was the popularity of bulk blends and slow released compound/blend fertilizers in the Northern part of China. Bulk blends are not only competing with NPKs but also grabbing some market from DAP as a standalone fertilizer\\nproduct. In recent years, the phosphate nutrient in bulk blends mostly came from DAP instead of granular MAP. So the growth of bulk blends may reduce the market size of both compound fertilizer and DAP.\\nSouth Korea: Potash imports up almost 30% in March\\nIn March, South Korea imported 49,279 mt of potash, a 28% increase year on year, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring the month, South Korea imported two shipments above 20,000 mt from Canpotex and BPC while 5,500 mt was imported from Laos\\' producers.\\nIn the first quarter of 2015 South Korea imported 178,976 mt, a 16% increase on Q1 2014 and the country\\'s largest Q1 potash imports since 2005.\\nCanpotex provided 68% of South Korea\\'s total potash imports during Q1, a reduction in the market share of Canpotex\\' Q1 shipments from 74% of the total in Q1 2014 and 90% in Q1 2013. BPC on the other hand shipped 26% of South Korea\\'s Q1 volumes, an increase from 23% in Q1 2014 and just 9% in Q1 2013.\\nSoutheast Asia: Market builds toward tender season\\nSoutheast Asian potash prices are quoted stable this week as suppliers attempt to push up prices in the coming tender season after settling the Chinese contract.\\nMalaysian standard MOP is being quoted at $315-325/mt CFR with only small quantities being booked and little buying interest in the country.\\nSome suppliers recently said they were looking to increase prices towards the $330/mt CFR level in Malaysia and will hope these prices can be achieved in the May tender season. Importers have noted more interest in prices above $315/mt CFR than in recent weeks and most have increased their prices to at least $325/mt CFR.\\nIn Indonesia, the recent Sinar Mas tender for 100,000 mt is believed to have been extended but offers were made around $335/mt CFR. In addition, there are rumours that a significant tender for H2 delivery as high as 500,000 mt is soon to be announced by Petrokimia Gresik for second half delivery.\\nIn Vietnam, BPC is shipping another cargo of 30,000 mt this week at roughly $340/mt CFR and prices remain quoted at $340-345/mt CFR with only small deals. As a result, prices in Southeast Asia remain at $315-345/mt CFR with Malaysian prices holding down the low end of the range.\\nChina: Domestic market continues to fall after new contract deal\\nWith more settlements of the 2015 potash contracts, Chinese domestic prices keep sliding further towards the new price. Port wholesale prices are down by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) already compared to the prices before the settlement between BPC and Chinese buyers on March 19.\\nThis week mainstream port wholesale prices for Russian red standard MOP on the whole remain stable at RMB 2,050/mt ($330/mt) FCA, while the low end has dropped to RMB 2,030/mt ($327/mt) FCA.\\nCompared with the relatively stable price of red standard MOP at port, there is a significant drop in the high end price for white 62% K2O product, which is seen at RMB 2,150/mt ($346/mt) FCA this week, down by RMB 50/mt ($8/mt) compared to last week. Overall, these prices have dipped by RMB 100/mt ($16/mt) compared to the period before the 2015 potash contract settlement.\\nWith the increasing arrivals of imported cargoes, some big distributors expect that domestic prices will remain weak throughout the rest Q2 2015, in particular in May-July when large volumes of fresh cargoes under the 2015 contracts arrive in China.\\nQSL slashed its potash prices this week. According to the price list announced by QSL Industry on April 15, the price of standard crystal MOP is now RMB 2,000/mt ($323/mt) CPT, the price for standard powder MOP is RMB 1,960/mt ($316/mt) CPT, and the price for 62% crystal product is RMB 2,070/mt ($334/mt) CPT.\\nAll of QSL\\'s new prices were effective from April 15 and went down by RMB 130/mt on average compared to the price list announced on February 6.\\nChina: Uralkali signs quantity agreement\\nUralkali has reached a deal to supply 850,000 mt of firm quantities to China between April and December 2015, the company said in a statement.\\nThe agreement has been signed with Sinochem, CNAMPGC and CNOOC.\\nThe company said the deal does not include optional volumes but was signed at the $315/mt CFR contract price agreed by BPC in March.\\nThe deal is for seaborne volumes, while Uralkali also sends roughly 1.3 million mt a year by rail to China, making it the country\\'s largest potash supplier.\\nCanpotex recently signed a 1.8 million mt firm agreement, BPC signed a firm 1.7 million mt and APC signed a firm 600,000 mt.\\nWith roughly 1.3 million mt of seaborne volumes sent by Uralkali to China in 2014, the 850,000 mt deal may be a sign that Uralkali could reduce its exports to China in 2015 following the loss of production from Solikamsk-2 late in 2014.\\nSULPHUR\\nANALYSIS\\nSulphur price drops $15/mt in Saudi Arabia and the US but has the floor been reached?\\nThe market was not surprised to see the announcement of the $15/mt drop in Saudi Aramco\\'s May price at the beginning of the week. Such a reduction had already been anticipated following the sharp drop in prices announced previously by Adnoc and Tasweeq.\\nEqually unsurprising but equally welcome to the industry is the drop in Q2 liquid sulphur contracts agreed in the US for Mosaic at a $15/mt reduction on Q1.\\nThere has been little activity this week as buyers watch and wait in the hope of further weakness. Demand from the phosphate sector is slow with a number of the larger phosphate producers in China planning turnarounds from now and into May. Likewise in India, CIL, PPL and IFFCO are also taking plants down for annual maintenance whereas in Jordan, IJC is down, JIFFCO is planning a shutdown but JPMC is due to resume operations at Aqaba following its scheduled turnaround.\\nThe Tunisian industry continues to face further challenges with even more curtailments in production ongoing since the end of 2014. Only in Morocco is demand comparatively buoyant and fuelled further by the recent startup of OCP\\'s JPH-1 with its 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit that has been brought up ahead of the phosphate units.\\nPhosphoric acid production at OCP\\'s existing units is running at relatively good levels through April and this trend should continue into May. OCP is still negotiating its Q2 sulphur contract prices and is looking for a reduction of at least $15/mt on Q1.\\nThe question remains as to how much further, if at all, this market will fall. The next test will be next week\\'s Tasweeq tender which will provide further clarity on the direction of the market.\\nWith demand from the phosphate side still relatively slow and expected to remain so until at least the end of the month, the general feeling from the industry is that a floor is yet to be reached.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Saudi Aramco announces $15/mt reduction in May price to $140/mt FOB\\n∙$15/mt reduction achieved in Q2 liquid sulphur contract in the US to $132/mt FOB\\n∙Turnarounds in China and India will keep demand slow\\n∙Q2 price for North Africa yet to be finalised\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nTampa: Phosphate producers win $15/lt cut for Q2 sulphur\\nSettlements finally emerged half way through April for Q2 contract liquid sulphur pricing between suppliers and US Gulf phosphate producers in the US Gulf. Mosaic said April 15 that it had settled its Q2 business at $132/mt FOB Tampa, down from $147/mt FOB for Q1. The Q2 price tag is just $3/mt above the Q4 Tampa price. Phosphate producers in the US and elsewhere have pushed sulphur suppliers hard to take into account falling DAP values and concerns about weaker crop prices going forward compared to the last couple of years.\\nEUROPE\\nPoland: Morocco continues to dominate Polish export line up\\nIn calendar year 2014, Morocco took 429,000 mt, some 85% of all Poland’s export availability for the year. A further 24,000 mt went into Brazil with 15,000 mt each to Argentina and Germany.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nQatar: Tasweeq tender closing April 21\\nAs reported last week, Tasweeq will close its next tender on April 21 for 35,000 mt.\\nJordan: No news yet on IJC tender\\nThere has been no news emerging on the IJC tender in Jordan for 40,000 mt sulphur and which closed on April 13 for delivery May 15-20. IJC took its plant down for annual maintenance at the end of March. The plant will remain shut through April.\\nJIFCO has no requirement for sulphur at present but if the planned maintenance shutdown does not go ahead in May, as originally scheduled, it may return to the market for a May cargo. Confirmation of the maintenance dates is still awaited.\\nJPMC took its phosphoric acid plant down on March 15 for 3- 4 weeks so should have resumed operations this week.\\nNegotiations continue for Q2 contracts in Morocco\\nNegotiations are yet to yield a settlement in negotiations for Q2 contracts between OCP and its suppliers. OCP is looking for a reduction of at least $15/mt on Q1 prices previously in the range of $160- 165/mt CFR while buyers are resisting and looking for less of a discount.\\nMeanwhile OCP claims to have booked spot tonnes in the high $130s / $140/mt CFR from Mediterranean and Middle Eastern suppliers.\\nTunisia: Further disruptions to the phosphate industry\\nLocal unrest continues to curtail phosphate rock production in Tunisia with sit-ins by the unemployed workers in the Gafsa region currently halting not only production in the mines but also transport of the rock from some of the mines to downstream plants.\\nCPG is able to transport rock from two of its mines by rail and is also using private truck companies but overall quantites will be reduced. As such production of phosphoric acid and therefore sulphur demand will have been affected accordingly.\\nDownstream production in Tunisia improved between September-November last year, averaging\\n60%. However, this latest wave of unrest and strike action has reduced production levels from December. The last official production estimate showed operating rates fall just below 40% in December.\\nWith Q1 phosphate rock production falling almost 40% against Q1 2014, the new government is making the region a priority and is endeavouring to find solutions to the issues that continue to challenge the industry.\\nIndia: Buyers hold out for lower prices\\nBuyers price ideas have dropped to $150-160/mt CFR India over the past week.\\nFollowing the latest posting for May tonnes out of Saudi Arabia confirming the downard trend, the market is holding out for even lower numbers. Demand remains curtailed in line with phosphate fertilizer production as a number of the larger producers take turnounds through April and into early May.\\nLower sulphur prices bring additional relief to DAP producers and as such DAP production via the phosphate rock and sulphur route remains the most attractive option for those with captive phosacid capacity. Negotiations are ongoing for Q2 phosphate rock contracts and Indian producers will be looking to offset any potential price rise for rock (on the back of the recent hike in the phosacid price) with lower sulphur prices.\\nThe latest sulphur arrivals in India are as follows:\\nIran: Kharg Petrochemical sales enquiry for 30,000 mt\\nKharg Petrochemical has issued a sales enquiry for 30,000 mt +/- 10% for April 10-20 lifting at Kharg Island.\\nIran: Q1 sulphur exports rise 69%\\nIran exported 435,163 mt of sulphur in the first three months, up 69% on the same period a year earlier, the latest GTIS data show.\\nThe country sent 361,900 mt to China, 63,800 mt to Indonesia and 9,500 to Pakistan in the first quarter. The numbers suggest a sharp increase in volumes to Indonesia.\\nWith the start up of the Petro-Abadi joint venture phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid plants mid 2014, Indonesia\\'s sulphur import requirement will have risen by up to 200,000 mt/year. The second such joint venture complex is now under construction in Indonesia with the third in the planning stage and demand will rise accordingly.\\nMarch exports totalled 127,000 mt, all of which were shipped to China. The volume was substantially on March 2014 and but less than exports of 160,426 mt in February this year.\\nSaudi Arabia: Aramco announces May sulphur price at $140/mt\\nFOB\\nSaudi Aramco has announced its price for May lifting at $140/mt FOB, representing a drop of $25/mt on its price for April tonnes of $165/mt FOB Saudi Arabia.\\nThis follows Tasweeq\\'s recent announcement of its price for April at $145/mt FOB, down $19/mt from March. Adnoc had previously announced its OSP for April at $140/mt FOB, representing a $35/mt fall against its price for March of $175/mt FOB.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: RCF tenders for 3,000 mt sulphur\\nRCF has issued a tender for the purchase of 3,000 mt sulphur in bulk (+/-10%) closing at 14:30 hrs in New Delhi on April 20. Offers are to remain valid for 15 days from the date of opening. Payment will be made 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the material.\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Q1 sulphur exports hit a record level\\nThe latest GTIS data for March show a recod volume of Q1 sulphur exports at close to 260,000 mt, almost all to China. The previous high for Q1 was in 2013 with 207,000 mt.\\nRecord volumes were also exported in calendar year 2014, reflecting the steady growth in sulphur export trade from South Korea. A total of 852,000 mt were exported with 780,000 mt delivered into China and a further 33,300 mt for the Philippines.\\nChina: Sulphur demand levels off and inventories stabilise\\nSulphur demand levels off and inventories stabilise while domestic prices weaken further.\\nHaving fallen below 1 million mt last week, port inventories have remained stable at around 1.1 million mt since the beginning of this week. The price for imported sulphur remains largely unchanged at around $155/mt CFR, reflecting the latest posting by Saudi Aramco at $140/mt FOB for May tonnes. The equivalent port price is quoted at RMB 1175-1185/mt inclusive of import tax and VAT.\\nOn the Yangtse River, prices for imported product are quoted in the range of RMB 1,140-1,160/mt ex warehouse at Nantong and Zhejiang.\\nAt Fangcheng, price indications are considered too high at RMB 1,200/mt to attract any serious interest.\\nWith over half the volume of imported sulphur destined for the phosphate industry, any changes to demand from phosphate producers will have an effect on sulphur. As such plans by a number of the larger producers to curtail production by way of rolling turnarounds through April and into May will temper demand for suphur accordingly.\\nCrushed lump sulphur is priced in the range of $130-140/mt CFR. Molten sulphur prices for Q2 have been set at around $150/mt CFR but this price was agreed in late March when spot prices were around $160/mt CFR. Currently spot molten prices should be nearer $140/mt CFR if not below.\\nPuguang has adjusted its price twice since last week, moving it down on April 13 by RMB 50/mt to RMB 1,100 Wanzhou port/RMB 1,000/mt ex works. However it was then moved back up again to the original level of RMB 1150/mt Wanzhou/RMB 1,050/mt ex works on April 14 where it currently stands.\\nVietnam: Award yet to be confirmed in Lafchemco tender\\nSwiss Singapore has been linked with a potential award but as yet nothing has been finalised. Price offers are said to be at or around $165/mt CFR.\\nSULPHURIC ACID\\nANALYSIS\\nSulphuric acid prices stable, market largely balanced\\nSulphuric acid prices were stable and little changed week on week, with some signs of demand emerging in Brazil, though too little to cause much of a stir in a largely balanced market.\\nWhile supply in the Far East remains tight due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds, and Glencore\\'s PASAR smelter in the Philippines confirmed it halted for an estimated 60 days of work, demand is insufficiently high to cause prices to rally.\\nSulphuric acid still looks undervalued compared to sulphur, even given the recent drop in sulphur prices.\\nPockets of spot demand emerge when traders need to cover short positions, though most seems to be comfortably met under long-term contracts. Talk of a very tight global market is perhaps exaggerated.\\nThe recent flooding in Chile may reduce consumption a little, though the impact is not currently expected to be very significant or lasting. Codelco\\'s Salvador mine will resume production on April 20 and Chileans are downplaying disruptions.\\nMost market participants are eying potential demand in Brazil in the weeks ahead and wondering when Morocco will rejoin the market as a major buyer.\\nHighlights of the Week:\\n∙Petrobras covers 15,000 mt requirement in high $80s/mt\\n∙PASAR smelter shuts for 60 days maintenance\\n∙Two Lions exports 6 cargoes to date in 2015\\n∙South Korea\\'s Q1 exports drop 5.3% year on year to 669,764 mt\\n∙Morocco still out of acid market, reportedly buying $40-41/mt CFR\\n∙Chinese smelter maintenance cuts some supply\\nBase Metals\\nBase metals were mostly in positive territory on April 16, supported by a weaker dollar and hopes of further economic stimulus from China. LME three-month copper settled $105/mt higher day on day at $6,060/mt, after reaching a four-week low on April 14. Aluminium, nickel, zinc and lead all settled higher.\\nDAP & Sulphur\\nThe decline in sulphur costs for Q2 negotiated this week for US Gulf phosphate producers was entirely expected. Buyers likely had little trouble convincing liquid sulphur suppliers that falling DAP prices globally could easily lead to production cuts if costs were not reduced. The move makes it more likely that US DAP exports will compete in India in the coming months.\\nNor was the sulphur market surprised to see the announcement of the $15/mt drop in Saudi Aramco\\'s May price at the beginning of the week. The reduction had already been anticipated following the sharp drop in prices announced previously by Adnoc and Tasweeq. Equally unsurprising but welcome to the industry was the drop in Q2 liquid sulphur contracts agreed in the US for Mosaic at a $15/mt reduction on Q1.\\nCaprolactam\\nCaprolactam prices reached $1,680-1,700/mt CFR China this week. Prices are expected to gain further support after benzene prices surged following an explosion at the Dragon Aromatics plant in China.\\nMARKETS\\nNORTH AMERICA\\nUS: Market quiet though smelter supply emerging\\nThe US acid market remains quiet though some smelter supply may be emerging with one player calling the market largely \"balanced to tight\". The US Gulf Spot CFR price was assessed unchanged at $70-80/mt, though buyers may be limited at the higher end of that range.\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nChile: Lack of spot demand, floods affect infrastructure\\nChile is still absent from the spot acid market and the recent flooding in the country may have some impact on consumption, though the situation in the country remains unclear.\\nThere is some speculation that some acid consumption in Chile may be lost due to potential restrictions on transport from port to site. Most players in Chile say there are no disruptions, though others say that inventories are relatively high at port and relatively low at site.\\nCodelco, the world\\'s largest producer of copper, said its Salvador mine will resume production on April 20, after the rains of March 24-25. The ramp up of output will be gradual, the company said in a filing with the Santiago exchange on April 9.\\nCodelco restarted its four mines in the Atacama Desert last month after torrential rains forced a\\nbrief shutdown, Bloomberg reported. A number of other mines in northern Chile were also temporarily halted, though most have now restarted after the worst flooding in more than 20 years.\\nBrazil: Petrobras covers 15,000 mt requirement\\nBrazil\\'s Petrobras covered a 15,000 mt acid requirement in the high $80s CFR Brazil.\\nThe price is within the range published by Fertilizer Week on April 9 for Sulphuric Acid Bulk CFR Brazil Spot of $80-90/mt.\\nThe cargo is due to arrive at the port of Barra dos Coqueiros at the end of May or early June. Chemtrade has been linked to the sale though this has not yet been confirmed.\\nSulphuric acid demand from Petrobras is likely to be fleeting. The company needs acid to produce ammonium sulphate at its plant in Laranjeiras, Sergipe state, which can produce 303,000 mt/year AS. The plant awaits the start-up of a new refinery which will eventually meet the acid requirements at the Laranjeiras site.\\nElsewhere, it is unclear whether Yara covered a rumoured requirement for two lots of 18,000 mt into Brazil, though market speculation linked Interacid and Glencore with the business. Neither could be reached for comment.\\nEUROPE\\nNW Europe: Market quiet with little spot availability\\nEuropean prices remain stable week on week and prices unchanged with minimal spot availability. The Bulk FOB NW Europe 30 days Spot price is assessed at an indicative $27-35/mt. Some participants believe given CFR prices into Brazil in the high $80s/mt and accounting for a trader\\'s margin, spot cargoes out of Europe may theoretically achieve a price has high as $40/mt FOB.\\nMIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\\nMorocco: OCP remains on sidelines\\nOCP remains out of the market for spot sulphuric acid.\\nThe company says it has paid $40-41/mt CFR Morocco for its recent limited business.\\nOCP has largely withdrawn from the acid market because of the scheduled startup of the first of its new integrated hub plants with its own captive sulphuric acid capacity.\\nThe 1.25 million mt/year sulphuric acid unit is in the final trial phase , the first of the production units in the first complex to start up, as previously reported by Fertilizer Week. While the company\\'s phosphate plants are being ramped up, there will be surplus acid available for use in OCP\\'s other facilities.\\nINDIAN SUBCONTINENT\\nIndia: Acid availability remains a concern\\nAvailability of acid remains a concern for phosphate producers. Spot price ideas are in the range of $60- 80/mt CFR, with most pegged in the $70s/mt CFR.\\nSSP buyers are sourcing from the local producers in the price range of INR 4000-5000/mt. ($65-80/mt).\\nMaintenance is underway at IFFCO and CIL that will run until mid-to-late April and PPL will undergo a shutdown from April 20, as reported last week.\\nThe latest sulphuric cid arrivals in India are as follows:\\n\\nASIA AND OCEANIA\\nSouth Korea: Q1 acid exports fall\\nSouth Korea\\'s sulphuric acid exports in the first quarter fell 5.3% year on year to 669,764 mt, the latest trade data from GTIS show.\\nAbout 40% of total export availability in Q1, 264,676 mt, went to China. Thailand absorbed 112,305 mt, the second highest volume, and an increase on the previous year of 73%. India grew its Q1 acid imports from South Korea by 35% year on year with imports of 105,337 mt in the first three months of 2015.\\nTonnes to Chile declined 30% in Q1 to 51,001 mt.\\nCurrent spot acid availability is very low in South Korea, with Korea Zinc understood to be sold out through much of Q2. One of the five units at Korea Zinc is currently undergoing maintenance, but with little impact on\\nproduction.\\nThe assessment for Japan/South Korea Spot/Contract remains indicative and unchanged at $17-22/mt FOB. A price as high as $30/mt FOB may be achieveable for sales into India, as opposed to East or Southeast Asia, though this remains a notional level give the lack of product.\\nChina: Two Lions exports 6 March cargoes but nothing yet in April\\nTwo Lions, China\\'s only acid exporter, is understood to have exported six cargoes of 18-22,000 mt through March, though there has been no business in April.\\nTrammo is rumoured to have taken three cargoes, with two suggested to Mitsubishi and one to Glencore.\\nTwo Lions last week restarted its second sulphur burner in Jiangsu province. The unit had been down since January 2014.\\nAfter more than 12 months out of service a restart at the plant, able to produce in excess of 1 million tonnes a year of acid, was necessary to avoid a deterioration of plant and equipment.\\nThe company has achieved very little export business over the past year, though tight availability from Japanese and South Korean smelters meant that some buyers needed to source Two Lions product recently.\\nThough sulphur-burnt product struggles to be competitive with smelter acid, the company will be benefitting from current falling sulphur prices. It is also able to boost margins by selling steam produced during the burning.\\nPhilippines: Glencore\\'s PASAR smelter shuts for maintenance\\nGlencore\\'s PASAR copper smelter in the Philippines shut on April 16 for an estimated 60 days of planned maintenance and work to increase capacity, a source at the smelter said today.\\nThe current annual sulphuric acid capacity of PASAR is 500,000 mt and work at the site is intended to double acid production, though a major increase in acid output is not likely to be felt until 2016.\\nThe majority of the acid was historically taken by the neighbouring Philphos plant for the production of phosphates. Philphos has been shut since November 2013 following Typhoon Haiyan and PASAR has been exporting increased volumes of acid since then.\\nWith Philphos not expected to restart operations in the near term, any additional volumes from the expansion of PASAR will be sold into the international market.\\nChina: Acid market stable even as sulphur declines\\nChina\\'s sulphuric acid market was stable and little changed over the past week, even as sulphur prices continued to show signs of weakness.\\nMajor smelter acid producers do not plan maintenance for April and May, though some smaller to medium- sized operations will shut.\\nNorthern Copper of Zhongtiaoshan Group, in Shanxi province Northern China, has two acid operations with a total capacity of 540,000 mt/year. The line with 420,000 mt/year acid capacity will start maintenance from April 25 for a month.\\nYanggu Xiangguang, a large copper smelter in Shandong province, is also scheduled for equipment maintenance from mid May. The total sulphuric acid capacity of the company is 1.2 million mt/year.\\nZhongyuan Gold Smelter, a new operation, shut down its old operation of 120,000 mt/year acid in early April. The new 1.2 million mt/year sulphuric acid operation will start commissioning on May 8, with commercial operations expected from May 25.\\nSulphur burner operating rates have dropped from around 74% to 70% and in some cases even lower. Demand from non-fertilizer industries is said to be lacklustre as China\\'s economy slows and traditional industries, such as chemicals, suffer.\\nNPKS\\nMARKETS\\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\\nVenezuela: NPK imports reach record high in 2014\\nVenezuela imported 605,000 mt NPKs in calendar year 2014, a 45% increase on the previous year and the third consecutive year of record imports, according to GTIS data.\\nDuring 2014, Venezuela imported 310,000 mt from Russia, almost double the volume supplied in 2013, with a further 144,000 mt shipped from Poland\\'s Police plant. Meanwhile, the volume of imported NPKs from Colombia into Venezuela has been growing steadily over the past five years, up from less than 5,000 mt in 2009, to almost 125,000 mt in 2014.\\nBen Farey, Editor in Chief\\nDirect Tel: +44 (0) 207 903 2015\\nMobile: +44 (0) 7885557034\\nEmail: ben.farey@crugroup.com\\nSubscriptions & Customer Services\\nTel: +44 (0)20 7903 2146\\nEmail: customer.services@crugroup.com\\nLegal Copyright Notice © 2015 CRU International Ltd\\nPlease note: Access to and use of this product are restricted by copyright and other law to named authorised users of companies with valid licences to do so.

But overall fertilizer traffic dipped by just 1.6pc across all the carriers to 6.9mn short tons (6.3mn metric tonnes) on the strength of a one-third\\nincrease in traffic on the US operations of Canadian National (CN). CN moved 307,552st of fertilizer inputs in the quarter.\\nRates for input chemicals declined at every carrier except CSX, where the cost to move fertilizer inputs gained 3.6pc to $9.03/st.\\nThe volume of super-phosphate solutions on most of the US operations of the Class I railroads and but overall sector\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nQuarterly Freight review: Rates\\ntraffic rose by 1.1pc to 5.7mn st because of a 48pc reduc- tion in Kansas City Southern traffic. The small Class I moved 10,191st of coal in the quarter compared with 19,739 in first quarter 2014. The stronger volume environment at most of the carriers supported higher rates for super-phosphate solu- tions at a majority of the carriers. Overall rates added 2.4pc to $31.61/st across all the railroads.\\nThe western railroads took stronger price increases on their\\ntraffic than the average with BNSF rates up by 7.2pc to\\n$44.25/st in first quarter 2015 while Union Pacific (UP) pric- ing gained 3.9pc. Shippers of fertilizer chemicals and super- phosphates ended first quarter 2015 at $48.82/st.\\nRates in the east were mixed, but lower on an absolute level than their western counterparts, at least in part because of shorter lengths of haul.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nFundamentals\\nAgriculture\\nWeather: Tropical Storm Bill pushed through the Texas coast this week, though the state did not sustain flood dam-\\nage similar to that induced by heavy storms at the end of May. Storms in the Midwest were much more pronounced, stretching from the Mississippi Delta to the upper Northeast. While precipitation dissipated over most of the country by mid-week, rainfall hung over east Texas and Missouri, whose crop progress is already well behind the five-year average. The 6-10 day forecast shows unusually dry weather through- out the south and Mississippi Delta, though most of the Corn Belt and Northeast should see rainfall, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Temperatures will also likely rise to above-average marks in the lower Atlantic and southern Corn Belt. The western Corn Belt and plains are expected to stay dry and show average temperatures in the next 6-10 days.\\nCrop progress: Plantings and crop conditions were mostly\\n6-10 day precipitation outlook\\nin line with previous weekly reports and five-year averages, though soybean plantings still trail their average rates, especially in Missouri and Kansas, which have seen an unusu- ally large amount of rain. US soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year aver- age for the second straight week, likely slowed by inclem- ent weather since the end of May. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average. Winter wheat conditions were rated 22pc poor and very poor, while good and excellent ratings were 43pc of the total crop. Spring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent.\\n— USDA\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nCrop prices: Storms in the US Gulf coast and Midwest proved bullish from front-month crop prices this week, especially for soybeans. With soybean plantings lagging and weather threatening late-season plantings, front-month soybean futures prices ended the week at $9.78/bushel, the highest close for the contract since 5 May. November soybean prices also climbed, ending the week at $9.42/bushel, the highest mark since 8 May and up nearly 40¢/bushel from early-week settlements.\\nAmmonia margin vs natural gas\\nHenry Hub (left scale) $/mnBtu\\nAmmonia producer margin (right scale) $/st\\nFront-month corn prices also climbed on weather concerns. July corn prices ended the week at $3.58/bushel, a 10¢/ bushel rally from earlier in the week. December corn prices held steady week-on-week, fall 2¢/bushel to settle 18 June at 3.73/bushel.\\nFeedstock\\nUS natural gas futures ended lower this week on a govern- ment report of a larger-than-average build in gas stockpiles and forecasts for milder weather in the coming weeks.\\nNymex gas for July delivery fell by 7.8¢/mmBtu, or 2.7pc, to settle at $2.777/mmBtu. Prompt-month prices rose to a four-week settlement high earlier this week but surrendered some of those gains ahead of the US Energy Information Administration\\'s (EIA) weekly inventory report.\\nUS gas stockpiles rose in the week ended 12 June by 89 Bcf (2.5bn m³), the EIA said. The build was smaller than the previous three injections, all of which exceeded 100 Bcf, be- cause of hotter weather. Last week\\'s injection fell short of analyst estimates for an increase of 92 Bcf, but it surpassed the five-year average injection for the week of 87 Bcf.\\nInventories have increased rapidly this year on increased domestic output. Stockpiles last week rose to 2.433 Tcf — 43pc higher than a year earlier and 1.9pc above the five-year average.\\nThe US rig count reached a 12-year low as weak oil prices forced producers to pull back drilling, but the shale indus- try\\'s run is far from over, oil major BP said.\\nThe rig count fell by nine to 859 this week, according to data from oilfield services company Baker Hughes. That\\'s the low-\\nest since 17 January 2003 when it fell to 845. It surpassed the lowest level of the previous market crash of 2008-09, when it dropped to 876 on 12 June 2009.\\nThe US shale boom allowed the US to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world\\'s largest oil producer and Russia as the larg- est producer of oil and gas, BP said in its annual Statistical Review said. US output increased by 1.6mn b/d last year, making the country the first ever to boost output by at least 1mn b/d a year for three consecutive years.\\nFreight\\nFertilizer barge movements on most US rivers have slowed as a surge in high water has made navigation difficult and forced the closure of several locks and dams.\\nRecent rains in some northern tier states, including Michi- gan, Minnesota and North Dakota, helped create runoff to the rivers that drove up water levels on the Illinois and up- per Mississippi rivers.\\nTwo Illinois river locks have been shut, preventing barges from moving north or south through the Starved Rock lock in Utica and the Marseilles lock in Marseilles. Barges continue to pass through high water at the Peoria lock in Creve Coeur and the LaGrange lock in Versailles because those locations have wicket dams that have been lowered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Dams at other locks are more perma- nent, requiring those sites to close in the high water.\\nBarge rates were unchanged this week after rising recently because of the high water and efforts by operators to limit storage. Some barge operators are offering higher spot rates for July because they are trying to hold onto more equip-\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nNorthbound rates originating from miles 90-184 for dry, bulk fertilizers. * No freight rates available based on seasonal closures.\\nment instead of allowing customers to use barges for storage until fall. Many are wary of releasing too much equipment this summer because they want to be sure to meet contract customer needs, a concern generated by last fall’s tight market.\\nSt Louis barge rates held for a second week at $9-10.75/short ton. Barges continue to pass through the area but that may change if high water in the area persists.\\nIf there is more rain in the next few days, operators may hold back northbound barges heading to the upper Mississip- pi and Illinois rivers for safety reasons. The Mississippi gauge at St Louis this morning was 33.2ft, above flood level of 30ft, and is expected to peak at 37.1ft by 22 June.\\nA tropical depression is heading for the for the middle Mis- sissippi and Ohio river valleys after making landfall along the central Texas coast on 16 June as a tropical storm before weakening.\\nArkansas river barge traffic has again been slowed by high water, less than 10 days after the corps reopened all locks from a similar problem. The Mayo lock near Fort Smith, Arkansas, has been shut, blocking fertilizer barges heading\\nnorth towards Muskogee and Inola/Catoosa.\\nBarge rates to destinations between Pine Bluff and Little Rock were flat at $14.50-16.50/st after increasing last week. Traffic along the waterway remains restricted to six-barge tows that can only be operated in daylight.\\nNitrogen\\nSustained rice demand and short-covering sustained higher loaded/prompt urea prices this week, but July values were under pressure amid concerns of higher imports and im- pending domestic production increases. Meanwhile, UAN and other nitrogen products have seen a steadier decline to summer reset values.\\nUrea (g)\\nThe urea barge market again traded in a wide range as traders placed a premium on loaded product, particularly as some scrambled to cover first-half June contract commit- ments.\\nThat premium led to multiple loaded barge trades at $380/ st fob Nola, up by $10/st from the high end of last week’s assessment and marking the highest point since 17 July 2014. Prompt/June-loading barges trended in line with the prior week, trading from $346-355/st fob Nola, with prices held up by rice demand in the south and the last tail of corn top- dress demand.\\nJuly prices were harder to pin down because of scarce bids. First-half July, CF-specific barges traded at $320/st fob Nola and July non-Chinese traded at $314/st fob. But offers for first-half July dropped from the low/mid-$310s/st fob Nola mid-week to $305/st as of press time, setting the bottom end of this week’s assessment. In addition, an August-loading non-Chinese barge traded at $292/st fob Nola, nearly a $100/ st below loaded prices this week.\\nThe lack of July buying interest came as traders assess a growing import lineup—a function of the $100/st price rally since April—most of which is likely to arrive after late-season demand has concluded. At least 260,000t of granular urea is estimated to arrive in July, with Saudi Arabia’s Sabic now planning to bring 60,000t to Nola in late July—its first of 10 cargoes for the US for the 2015-16 fertilizer year.\\nThe US typically imports less urea in July because of an ebb in seasonal demand. However, it did import 250,000t during\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nPrices\\nJuly 2014 by vessel, compared to just 81,000t in 2013. In ad- dition to the estimated 260,000t for this July, a few vessels remain up in the air, with additional shipments from Algeria and Kuwait possible.\\nContinued barge delays on the Arkansas river kept ware- house prices firm in Inola/Catoosa and St Louis. Inola/ Catoosa urea inventory is nearing depletion with those with remaining tons consistently achieving $415/st fot. Only a few thousand tons are estimated still in Inola/Catoosa and barge resupply is still a ways off because of high-water restricting traffic on the Arkansas river (see Freight). The shortage in Inola/Catoosa has pulled prices up in St Louis, which climbed as high as $390/st fot as buyers look to truck urea from that hub to southern destinations. Northeastern Arkansas warehouses on the Mississippi river have also achieved $410/ st fot.\\nPrices in Cincinnati/Jeffersonville and Twin Cities were un- changed amid limited activity.\\nIn projects, CF Industries will add 130,000 st/yr of granular urea/DEF/urea liquor capacity to its Courtright, Ontario,\\nEstimated incoming urea vessels\\nplant through a debottlenecking project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

However, potential buyers are resist- ing prices above the $235/t cfr mark.\\nAlthough movement to the field has been limited, terminal prices have yet to move toward summer fill values—likely because the remaining inventory was purchased at higher, in-season values. Latest offers are heard in the range of $280-295/st fob Nola for UAN32.\\nAmmonium nitrate (p)\\nDemand remains lackluster for ammonium nitrate. Barge\\nlength on the river continues to pressure buy price ideas, but no new business was confirmed this week. The Nola as- sessment is unchanged at $260-265/st fob Nola.\\nWarehouse prices in Tampa and the Mid South are stable. Latest prices in the lower Ohio river valley are heard near $345/st fot.\\nAmmonium sulfate (g)\\nAmmonium sulfate prices are stable, with limited supply offsetting lower seasonal Corn Belt demand. Producers are focused on building fall inventory with spring demand concluded.\\nHouston/Pasadena prices are unchanged at $260/st fot as producers look to complete seasonal commitments before considering a summer fill price. Given the nationwide tight- ness of amsul, some are not ruling out the possibility of flat summer pricing. In the Northern Plains, fill prices have been discussed around $300-310/st delivered, depending on loca- tion.\\nAmsul production on the Texas Gulf Coast was minimally impacted by Tropical Storm Bill, which made landfall on 16 June southwest of Houston. Producers reported normal load- ing operations during the storm.\\nAmmonia\\nPrices in the US ammonia market continued to soften this week with the end of side dress season hastened by a sud- den and severe bout of wet weather hitting the east Corn Belt. Corn is now expected to be too tall for further ap- plications by the time saturated soils have dried out. This has caused an earlier than expected cutoff for offtake this season, and could result in increased carryout for suppliers in the region.\\nEast Corn Belt prices moved to $590-610/st fot, a $10/st decline from last week’s range. There was little if any buying at these levels, but offers have drifted only marginally lower given the tight inventory situation.\\nIn the west Corn Belt there has been little or no business concluded and prices are still discussed in the wide range of $525-590/st fot, with the high end farther east.\\nDistributors have yet to move to summer fill values as there is little sense of urgency to sell with inventories lean despite\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\n* Indicates confirmation with Zepol import/export database.\\nValues without * are estimates based on vessel size and/or previous shipments.\\n— Genscape\\nthe weather-shortened season. Instead, the near-term focus will be on rebuilding stocks ahead of fall demand, with some light fill selling likely later in the summer.\\nHowever, most producers have moved to summer fill pric-\\ning. In Oklahoma, offers have moved to the $470-480/st fob range. Meanwhile, there are reports a Texas producer is selling summer-loading tons at $450/st fot. In the Dakotas, a producer will issue fill pricing shortly, likely at a price in the mid-$500s/st delivered.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nLast summer, prices at Oklahoma production sites bottomed at $440/st fob in June before topping $600/st fob in August.\\nInternational ammonia highlights\\n\\x84\\x84A fire that shut down Yara’s Brunsbuttel, Germany, am- monia plant has led the company to secure 20,000t for July loading from the Baltic. The cargo was purchased from more than one supplier at $400/t fob Ventspils and Silla- mae.\\n\\x84\\x84In Turkey, Trammo has been awarded the Petkim tender for 6,000t for early-July delivery at about $410/t cfr, which nets back to about $380/t fob Yuzhny.\\n\\x84\\x84CJ Indonesia has awarded its tender for 6,000t for early- July delivery to local supplier Petrokimia Gresik in the high-$440s/t cfr.\\nPhosphate\\nThe US phosphate market remains stable but thinly traded with demand seasonally limited.\\nDAP barge prices remain within a tight $418-420/st fob Nola range amid slim buying interest. DAP prices appear to have hit a floor, with the US market at a significant discount to other markets limiting downside. However, price upside could be limited by low crop prices that may result in a de- cline in fall grower demand. The paper market underscores this flat trend with prices for August/September virtually even with prompt values.\\nThe US import lineup for the third quarter for now consists of one expected DAP/MAP vessel from Morocco’s OCP—likely a contractual shipment for PotashCorp. Additional spot car- goes from Morocco have been treated with skepticism given Nola’s low prices, especially relative to Brazil.\\nIn exports, Mosaic sold 17,000t DAP to various Latin Ameri- can markets for July shipment at $470-474/t fob Tampa, down slightly from last business.\\nHigher shipments to India and Latin American countries boosted US exports of DAP/MAP in May to their highest monthly total since May 2014.\\nThe US exported 236,180st P2O5 of DAP/MAP (estimated 450,000-510,000st product) in May, a 33.8pc month-on- month climb but down 4.8pc from the same month last year,\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nUS phosphate import tracker\\nPhosphate barge business\\naccording to the Fertilizer Institute (TFI).\\nThe US shipped 75,945st P2O5 to India in May, the highest monthly total since October 2014 and the second consecu- tive month it has sent exports to the major DAP consumer since October-November 2014. These shipments were up about 63pc both from May 2014 and April 2015. Year-to- date shipments to the country are up 73.1pc compared to January-May 2014.\\nThe US exported 113,640st P2O5 to South American coun- tries in May, the largest sum since June 2014. May shipments to the region were up 41.7pc from April but down 11.5pc from the same month last year. Exports to Brazil were 87,090st P2O5, in line with April, while shipments to Colom- bia and Peru totaled 15,683st and 10,867st, respectively. The US exported 9,532st to Central American countries, 8,366st of which went to Guatemala.\\nThe US did not export any DAP/MAP to Australia in May for the second month in a row. Calendar year-to-date exports to Australia stand at 71,114st P2O5, down 32.7pc from January- May 2014.\\nCanada received 10,047st P2O5 in May from the US, down 46.1pc month-on-month and a 79.3pc fall from the same month last year. The US exported 11,736st P2O5 to Mexico in May, down 18.5pc from April and 31.8pc from May 2014.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nHigher May exports led January-May US P2O5 exports to reach 869,339st, a 3.4pc year-over-year increase.\\nUS phosphoric acid exports jumped in May after lagging in previous months, reaching 35,396st P2O5, a 27.5pc jumped from the same month last year. India received 52.4pc of all US shipments, with Brazil, Mexico and Canada rounding out the remaining supply. Phosphoric acid exports for the calen- dar year-to-date are down 18.5pc to 111,233st P2O5.\\nDAP/MAP\\nDAP barge prices were steady this week with trades for July-loading domestic tons at $419/st fob Nola. Bid/offers for physical barges bracketed either side of that level, upholding the prior $418-420/st fob Nola range. A domestic DAP barge traded this week at $425/st fob Nola, but was excluded from the range because of specific circumstances that made it not representative of the market, according to the seller. No MAP trades were confirmed, but the product continues to be indicated at a $5-10/st premium to DAP.\\nDAP/MAP warehouse demand is seasonally limited and prices unchanged from last week. Some wholesalers still have post- ed DAP prices of $460-465/st fot, particularly on the Ohio river, but no substantial sales at that level were confirmed.\\nInternational phosphate highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Brazil, phosphate-based fertilizer consumption shrank by 19.1pc to 1.15mn t in the first five months of 2015 because of a decline in demand in sugar cane and second- crop corn sectors, as well as a decline in purchases for the upcoming soy planting season which begins in September, according to industry association Anda. Domestic phosphate production rose by 4.2pc, while imports fell by nearly 27pc in the January to May period. Brazilian fertilizers sales are expected to decline this year for the first time since 2009,\\n0\\naccording to market estimates. The bulk of the decline will come from imports, with domestic production increas- ing. This sluggishness has contributed to a bearish tone in prices, with MAP offers dipping as low as $490s/t cfr.\\n\\x84\\x84In Argentina, a trader sold 30,000t Australian DAP at $505-507/t cfr for July shipment, while China’s YUC sold June MAP at $500-505/t cfr to this market.\\n\\x84\\x84China produced 4.3mn t of DAP and 2.9mn t of MAP in the first quarter, which are year-over-year increases of 17pc and 13pc, respectively, according to the China Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry. China exported 935,000t DAP and 481,000t MAP in the first quarter, according to customs data--both substantially higher year-over-year because of the country\\'s move to a flat year-round export tax.\\nPotash\\nThe North American market remains in a seasonal lull ahead of formal summer fill price announcements.\\nNon-Belarusian import barges for June/July-loading traded this week within the prevailing $315-325/st fob Nola range, though activity was limited given scant prompt application demand. There has been discussion of offers possibly as low as $310/st fob Nola, but no business has been confirmed lower than $315/st fob.\\nLast week, the Nola MOP assessment reached its lowest point since February 2014. The assessment is $43/st lower than this time last year on a midpoint basis. It has also dropped by $43/st since the beginning of 2015.\\nWarehouse prices were also flat on limited demand, with\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nCorn Belt prices still indicated at $360-375/st fot. Buyers are awaiting summer fill prices, which could be introduced by the end of the month. For now, Canadian producers are oc- cupied by fulfilling contractual standard MOP obligations to China and India while also shipping granular MOP tonnage to consignment warehouses within the US.\\nNorth American potash producers and buyers are looking to Brazil for signs of support for granular MOP prices globally. The Nola potash premium to Brazil stands at about $15/t, the slimmest margin since March 2014 and down by more than $30/t from March 2015.\\nImport data suggests Brazil still needs to buy a substantial amount of tonnage. Imports over the first five months of 2015 of 2.3mn t are down 30pc year-over-year, with Canada, Russia, Belarus and Chile all seeing a drop off in shipments, according to customs data. Market expectation is for more buying to take place, leading to higher Brazil cfr offers for July and August from producers, but upside could be limited by the depreciating real and unfavorable crop prices relative to fertilizer prices.\\nBrazilian potash demand fell by 17.9pc to 1.35mn t in the first five months of 2015 from the same period a year earlier, with domestic production up by 1.1pc and imports down\\nby nearly 25pc compared to the same five-month period of 2014, according to Brazilian fertilizer industry association Anda.\\nInternational potash highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Chile, SQM could be facing the revocation of its mining concessions in the Salar de Atacama by Corfo, the Chilean state-owned economic development agency. Salar Atacama is the source for SQM’s MOP and SOP products, among oth- ers. Its NOP-based products are sourced from outside the\\nSalar de Atacama and would theoretically be unaffected if SQM lost its concession. See Fertilizer news for more.\\n\\x84\\x84In India, ICL is understood to be close to finalizing supply contracts with Indian buyers, likely totaling near 680,000t. If confirmed, the commitments would bring total firm contracted tonnage to India to about 4.3mn t, with an ad- ditional 550,000t optional.\\n\\x84\\x84Allana Potash shareholders this week approved the acquisition of the company and its Ethiopian potash project by Israel’s ICL. ICL in March offered to buy all the outstand- ing shares of Allana for about $110mn. The transaction is expected to close around 22 June. The deal is subject to the approval of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice, among other conditions. The Ethiopian project has estimated ca- pacity of 1mn t/yr MOP, while preliminary studies into SOP production have also been made.\\nGlobal sulfur prices\\nSulfur and sulfuric acid\\nBrazil MOP imports\\nSulfur\\nThe US sulfur market is balanced, with no disruption stem- ming from heavy storms along the US Gulf coast. Tropical storm Bill hit the Texas coast 16 June, forcing Shell to evacu- ate personnel from its offshore facilities and causing minor\\n9.0refinery issues (see Operations News). But the actual impact on sulfur movements was negligible. Truck loadings from\\n8.7refineries were uninterrupted and domestic barge activity\\n8.4had no issues.\\n8.1\\n7.8\\nIn Canada, sulfur loadings at Syncrude’s facilities, which had been halted because of internal H2S limits, have resumed. The oil consortium stopped truck loadings last week at its\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nfacilities in the Alberta oil sands after restarting shipments just the week prior. Syncrude has revised its internal limits on H2S content from 30ppm to 50ppm, which likely contrib- uted to its ability to resume shipments.\\nInternational sulfur highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In China, new sales and firm bids have moved granular prices up slightly to a range of $162-165/t cfr China. End-us- ers in China confirm receiving offers in the low-$160s/t cfr. With freight from the Middle East quoted at $13-17/t (south- north China), the netback has moved up to the $150/t fob Middle East mark.\\nSulfuric acid\\nPCS will close its sulfur-burned sulfuric acid plant at Geis- mar, Louisiana, by 18 June, according to the company, putting an end to the long-anticipated shutdown. The plant was originally scheduled to close 31 May, but that deadline was pushed back to a date that was \"most advantageous to the company.\" PCS is closing the facility because of expenses\\nneeded to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The company cut emissions related to phosphoric acid production at the fertilizer production site in 2013.\\nThe plant consumes an estimated 150,000 t/yr of sulfur to make around 450,000 t/yr of sulfuric acid, and will now pro- cure its supply in the merchant market. It is understood that the majority of the facility’s sulfuric acid needs have been covered on a contractual basis, but market participants expect PCS to take some tonnes from the spot market.\\nInternational sulfuric acid highlights\\n\\x84\\x84In Cuba, the second sulfuric acid plant at Sherritt\\'s Moa facility is expected to be operational by the final quarter of 2016, slightly pushed back from estimates announced back in March. The burner will have 2,000 t/day of sulfuric acid production capacity (around 667 t/d of sulfur consumption). Once operational, it will reduce its import requirements accordingly.\\nFertilizer news\\nCF to expand Courtright urea capacity\\nCF Industries will expand the urea-based product capacity at its Courtright nitrogen fertilizer complex in Sarnia, Ontario, by 130,000 st/yr with an $85mn debottlenecking project.\\nDebottleneck work at Courtright\\'s existing urea plant will be- gin in 2015 and is expected to be done in the fourth quarter of 2017, concurrent with a planned turnaround. Courtright has an existing average urea capacity of 160,000 st/yr.\\nThe expansion will increase CF\\'s ability to produce granu- lar urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and urea liquor at the plant. Courtright has an average gross ammonia capacity of 500,000 st/yr and UAN capacity of 345,000 st/yr.\\nThe Courtright expansion follows major projects at CF\\'s nitrogen plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, which are on track to be completed in 2016. Com- bined, those two expansions will add an estimated 2.1mn st/ yr gross ammonia, 2mn-2.7mn st/yr of granular urea and up to 1.8mn st/yr of UAN, depending on product mix, according to CF\\'s annual report.\\nChile’s SQM risks losing mining concession\\nCorfo, Chile´s state-owned economic development agency, is hardening its stance against SQM in an effort to strip the\\ncompany of its rich mining concession in the northern Chil- ean saltbed known as Salar de Atacama.\\nSQM and Corfo have been in arbitration over the matter since 16 May 2014. Corfo asserts that SQM has not honored concession payments and has blocked out competitors, claims that SQM has denied. In recent months, a tax fraud and illegal campaign finance scandal engulfing SQM have deepened the rift in the wake of a cabinet shake-up trig- gered by the ongoing controversy.\\nCorfo is expected to reject an arbitration judge´s recom- mendations at the next arbitration meeting on 9 July, seek- ing instead to revoke the Salar de Atacama lease. SQM said on 18 June that it has not been informed that Corfo plans to abandon the arbitration process.\\nThe Salar de Atacama is the source for SQM´s MOP, SOP, lithium carbonate, boric acid and magnesium chloride. Ac- cording to SQM, revenues from products derived from this raw material accounted for 39pc of its consolidated revenue in 2014. SQM produces its NOP-based products from caliche ore sourced outside the Salar de Atacama, and this would (in theory) be unaffected if SQM lost its concessions in the Salar de Atacama.\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nWeather delays progress for wheat, soy: USDA\\nRainy weather over most of May delayed soybean plantings and the winter wheat harvest, according to the US Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report.\\nUS soybean plantings were 87pc finished the week ended 14 June, three percentage points behind the five-year average. Plantings in Kansas were 57pc complete, down from the 85pc average, while Missouri had planted 42pc of its soybeans, down from the 79pc average. This year\\'s Missouri soybean plantings are at the slowest rate since 1995. Rain over the last 30 days has been particularly heavy in both states with areas in east Kansas and northwest Missouri receiving more than 12 inches during that span, according to the National Weather Service. All other 16 of the top 18 producing states are within at least two percentage points of the average.\\nSoybeans were 75pc emerged the week ended 14 June, two percentage points behind the five-year average, again pulled down by Kansas (30pc) and Missouri (28pc). Soybean condi- tions were in line with historical data, however, with 67pc of the crop rated good or excellent.\\nWinter wheat conditions were not as strong, with 22pc of the crop rated poor and very poor, up from 20pc the previ- ous week. Good and excellent ratings were in line with the previous week at 43pc.\\nHarvested winter wheat lagged behind the five-year average for the second straight week. Overall winter wheat was 11pc harvested, down nine percentage points from the average.\\nOklahoma (38pc) and Arkansas (39pc), which had both seen heavy storms through the end of May and early June, were 19pc and 17pc behind their respective harvesting averages.\\nSpring wheat condition was rated 70pc good and excellent, unchanged from the previous week, with only 4pc of the crop rated poor and very poor.\\nThe number of days suitable for fieldwork was mixed the week ended 14 June, especially in the Corn Belt. Illinois (2.3), Indiana (3.2) and Iowa (3.2) all saw less days week- over-week for fieldwork, while Kansas (4.4) Kentucky (5.8) and Missouri (3) showed improvement.\\nOverall corn progress held steady the week ended 14 June, with plantings two percentage points above the average at 97pc. Corn condition was also flat to the previous week at 73pc rated good and excellent.\\nPlantings for cotton and sorghum still lagged behind for the five-year averages. Overall cotton plantings were 91pc completed, down from the 96pc average, while sorghum was 71pc planted, behind its 80pc average.\\nCME declares force majeure on corn, soy\\nCME Group declared force majeure for corn and soybean shipments because of high-water conditions on the Illinois river, preventing barge loadings. The area has seen recent heavy rains, which has made barge loading and movement difficult. CME said a majority of corn and soybean loading facilities are located along the Illinois river.\\nCalifornia curtails water use for farmers\\nRegulators cut water supply to California\\'s largest agricul- tural areas last week, the latest step in the state\\'s efforts to curtail water use during a historic drought.\\nThe State Water Resources Control Board announced 12 June that there is insufficient water to supply senior water right holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento areas.\\nCalifornia\\'s water rights are based on seniority. When the water system becomes insufficient to supply all right hold- ers, those with junior rights are forced to stop using water to accommodate senior users.\\n\"Some water right holders may have other, more senior rights to fall back on, or have water stored in reservoirs that they can still access,\" the board said. \"If that\\'s not available they will have to find other sources of water, such as ground- water or purchased water, if available.\"\\nOverall, 114 rights holder will be affected, including 86 along the Sacramento river, impacting the use for irrigation, stockwatering and livestock. The state first implemented water restriction in April, though those rules focused more on residential use and did not impact agriculture.\\nCalifornia had the highest revenue from agricultural pro- duction in the US in 2013 with $46.4bn, $15.2bn more than the next highest state, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\\nThe state will produce 1.9bn pounds of almonds in 2015, down just 1pc from 2014 despite the ongoing drought, ac- cording to the USDA. Area that will produce almonds is pro- jected to reach a record 890,000 acres, up 2.2pc from 2014, with a yield of 2,080 pounds/acre. One acre of almonds uses an estimated 250lbs of nitrogen, according to the University\\nLicensed to: Adil Soulami, OCP GROUP\\nArgus FMB North American Fertilizer\\nof California, Davis. Comparatively, one acre of corn uses up to 180lbs of nitrogen. One acre of almonds also uses 150lbs of potash, 2-5lbs of boron and 10-15lbs of zinc.\\nPlantings for principal field crops – including corn, wheat and soybean – in the state are all in line with the historical five- year averages, and crop conditions are rated at least 85pc good to excellent, according to the USDA.\\nIssue 15-24\\u2003 |\\u2003 Thursday 18 June 2015\\nAnnouncement — email settings\\nArgus will soon change the email domain from which we send out reports to some subscribers.
